      "reviewBody": "This reminds me of my discovery with Tetsuo, ten years ago, of a cinema out there. Tetsuo for me at the time was like listening for the first time to bands like Throbbing Gristle or SPK. The term &apos;industrial&apos; wasn&apos;t just a commercial label, it communicated something fundamental of the fabric it was made of, not of style but of the sound itself (in Tetsuo&apos;s case, the image). It was enough to simply experience it, interpretations seemed superfluous.\n\nSnake of June is a similar experience for the body, in the sense that the ideas explored pale in comparison to the exploration itself. Whatever it&apos;s a portrait of, of sexual or personal liberation from the self, it&apos;s the portrait that matters to me.\n\nThe grimy aesthetic pulsing with grain and noise, the fluid camera exploring dark recesses of an urban dystopia of constant downpour, the sudden bursts of fetishized sex, all these orient and provide contrast and context to what is explored. It&apos;s not enough to see these personal demons overcomed by the female protagonist, the boundaries of mundane existence broken apart, it counts to experience how they reflect.\n\nA view of the mind is permitted here through a camera obscura, dancing on the walls of the mind we see demented projections. The emerging view is not clear, but like the best of surreal cinema, kaleidoskopic. We may piece something together of the image we see, but that&apos;s hardly the point for me. I point a kaleidoskope to something to experience the phantasmagoria of the fracture, Snake of June works likewise. The portrait we get is not a lifelike depiction, but an expressionist one.\n\nThis may be linked to horror cinema due to Tsukamoto&apos;s credentials, but it&apos;s really New Wave in the best tradition of directors like Susumu Hani and Toshio Matsumoto."

      "reviewBody": "I saw &quot;Casshern&quot; yesterday at a packed theater and I was blown away. I went in looking for a black-and-white head-busting superhero flick, but I got a lot more than I bargained for.\n\nFirst off, the photography is gorgeous--as director, cinematographer, and editor Kazuaki Kiriya makes excellent use of color and grain in his film. At times it&apos;s a fuzzy, glowing dream, while at others it&apos;s stark, black-and-white sandpaper on your brain. It&apos;s an ingenious device to change the mood of the film instantaneously.\n\nThere are hints of any number of films here--Metropolis, Frankenstein, Mononoke Hime, Terminator, Tetsuo--and yet the film definitely stands on its own. By no means a slavish adaption of the original animated series, it does contain a number of nods to elements of the original that fans will surely recognize (I leave it to other viewers to catch these for themselves). I was particularly impressed by the first appearance of Luna, who looks like she stepped out of a painting by Tatsunoko alumnus Yoshitaka Amano in that scene.\n\nThe action scenes are backed by a driving rock score which reminded me of &quot;The Crow&quot; for some reason. Hardcore action fans who are hoping for a &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot; bumper-to-bumper slugfest will be sorely disappointed, though. The fight scenes actually run counter to the message of the film--that, as one character states, &quot;War makes humans inhuman.&quot; There is a long tradition in Japanese fiction--and animation, in particular--of the hero becoming what he hates to triumph over his enemy. The perfect example of this is Devilman, who becomes a demon to do battle with other demons. There is also a saying in Japan, &quot;kokoro wo oni ni suru&quot; or &quot;steel your heart with resolve,&quot; and &quot;Casshern&quot; proves that some decisions will indeed set us on the road to having the hardened heart of a demon. In the end, most conflicts can never be won--even if you win, you lose, as you have more than likely sown the seeds for the next conflict.\n\nI have no idea how foreign audiences will take to the message in this film, but I could hear a number of people crying in the darkness around me, and the crowd was uncharacteristically silent as they left the theater. As a translator, I hope this gets the treatment it deserves when it gets subtitled--the dialog isn&apos;t particularly difficult for those with a moderate knowledge of Japanese, and there are vast stretches of film with no dialog at all, but there are also a number of nuances that might be lost. The omnipresent Chinese and Cyrillic characters of the Asian Federation create an oppressive mood that&apos;ll be difficult to convey--the nearest example I can think of is the subliminal messages in John Carpenter&apos;s &quot;They Live.&quot; Some of the other devices used in the film, such as multiple voices repeating portentous words &quot;You don&apos;t know what war&apos;s like,&quot; might also be difficult to convey with normal subtitling. Nevertheless, I hope to see this film made available to a larger audience soon.",

      "reviewBody": "Fast hit fun with Caterina Valente and Rudolf Prack\n\nTo start off you can see La Valente and Richard Allan dancing Calypso (&quot;Tipitipitipso&quot;). Wow! We know that Caterina Valente, who has just turned 90, is a first-class show star. And Richard Allan (1923-1999) cut a dazzling figure as Hildegard Knef&apos;s dancer in &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; (1952).\n\nIn &quot;The Simple Girl&quot; you see the two as newcomer Caterina Bastiani and film star Robert Holden. Caterina is set to play the title role of the &quot;simple girl&quot;, a bestseller by Thomas Krauss (Rudolf Prack), in the upcoming film adaptation. But the author, who lives in the provinces with his young son, rejects the alleged glamor aunt unseen. To convince him of his opinion, Caterina sets off for the provinces with her agent Milli (famous as always: Ruth Stephan). By chance, instead of Eva (Helen Vita), she gets the job as a housemaid in the author&apos;s castle (!), where Caterina now intends to act as a particularly &quot;simple girl&quot; to her arrogant author. If only love didn&apos;t get in the way... Don&apos;t worry: Ruth Stephan doesn&apos;t miss out either. She even lets Rudolf Platte paint her naked as a drunken artist!\n\nThings could be so turbulent and a little bit offensive in the 1950s. Like every other Valente film, this fun was made in Artur Brauner&apos;s CCC studios in Berlin. The script came from Curth Flatow (1920-2011), the inventor of the 80s ZDF hit series &quot;Ich heirate eine Familie / I&apos;m Marrying a Family&quot;, who also worked closely with the ZDF showmaster Hans Rosenthal (1925-1987).\n\nMatzen Castle in Reith, Tyrol served as the best-selling author&apos;s modest residence. Other songs sung by Caterina Valente: &quot;When love falls in two hearts&quot; and &quot;Bravo Caterina (There are still fairy tales)&quot;.\n\nThe film premiered on August 23, 1957 in the Thalia in Wiesbaden. Oh yes, the director was Werner Jacobs (1909-1999), who was supposed to film &quot;Hier bin ich - hier bleib ich / Here I am - here I stay&quot; with La Valente.",

Anyway, the story line is so obvious, that everybody who has seen a couple of these &quot;Good guys try to get a treasure, and bad guys try to kill them and get it too&quot;-movies can really write the script by himself. Thank God I saw the whole thing on TV. I could at least flee every now and then and watch something else..."

      "reviewBody": "Robert Armstrong is a bookie. Irene Hervey is a hostess at a dime-a-dance hall. When she clips him, he bets his cronies he can take her for $500. He convinces her he is a theatrical agent, gets together a retired troupe of actors and uses some IOUs to put on a performance of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&apos;s THE MIKADO for an evening. Yet he gradually comes to understand that all these people are going to ruin themselves for his ill-spirited joke.\n\nFor an old Savoyard like me, there are few joys as great as hearing the songs from the operettas well sung, and Andrew Stone, one of the few producer-writer-directors of the era has turned out a movie that not only offers the songs well, but uses them to establish the mood and character of the scenes. While I think that seeing these performances chopped up will reduce their impact on a modern audience, it should be remembered that this movie was not made for the second decade of the 21st Century, but for 1937, when the D&apos;Oyley Carte Company was still in vigorous strength, both at their home at the Savoy Theater and on international tour; THE HOT MIKADO, with the music given a jazz beat, would open a couple of years after this, and be a hit; and Schertzinger&apos;s movie version of THE MIKADO would also be a success.\n\nThat time is gone, of course. While I saw the D&apos;Oyley Carte on Broadway, that was decades ago. The company has been on life support since 2003. A recent revival was closed down because it featured Caucasian actors -- as if it were never a satire of Victorian England. For me, and people like me, this movie will be a delight.",

If I had bought the film instead of renting it from Netflix, I would have demanded my money back--this particular film was that bad! And, to make it worse, this film is a pared down version of the 1927 film by the same name--so you are getting only about half of the original film. Because of this, I really can&apos;t recommend you watch it--there simply are thousands of better quality and more interesting films out there.\n\nIf the film had been better quality, I would have probably given it a 4--it&apos;s an average to slightly below average B-western.

The only worth while event of sitting through this insult was listening to the wise-cracks and jocularities coming from the audience. Watching Barry Morse (a fine actor) humiliate himself with contortionistic facial expressions related to an attack of hemorrhoids was laughable! Jack Palance(another fine actor)didn&apos;t fair any better with his army of robots looking like walking garbage cans! All in all a complete waste of time. Possibly twenty years from now this might become a cult classic or mercifully disappear out of cinematic history!",

Also, I ALWAYS see the positive in movies, I&apos;m pretty positive when it comes to movies. But this just sucks.\n\nThere is close to no entertainment to be had from this garbage. The plot is, oh, right, there is no damn plot. A couple of things happen, and some people talk. The story is so thin, it&apos;s about a minutes worth. Stretched to countless horribly boring hours. (it&apos;s actually just barely over one hour) The acting is bad, fake and stupid. Are any of the actors here actually trained actors anyway? Seems like they&apos;re all extras. Bad extras.\n\nThe budget has to be way below shoe-string, there is hardly anything to have a cost here at all. Nothing that can&apos;t be done with like, normal household stuff. And this is supposed to be horror, right? When there is no plot, at least give us some make up or special effects, something!\n\nRight, there are a couple of scenes with some super fake looking blood, but it&apos;s just so bad. The blood looks like pink water. Cool bro.\n\nSo, to sum up: this movie sucks and blows, ducks and hoes. Is that not an expression? Well then smack my ass and call me Tomie!\n\nThere are a couple of scenes that are so strange they become sort of funny, but just one or two. And the main girls are pretty, that&apos;s something.\n\nAvoid this garbage. At just over an hour, this is still boring as hell.",

      "name": "Building an entire wedding movie around sex jokes, but adds in some well-timed honest family drama",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Big Wedding&quot; seems to be following in the footsteps of the recent Hollywood romantic comedies – gather as many big name stars as you can and put them all in a romantic comedy storyline. It&apos;s the best of the bunch, even though that&apos;s not saying anything at all. It&apos;s also based on a French film &quot;Mon frère se marie&quot;, and that&apos;s not really saying all that much either.\n\nAny description of the plot is just going to read as a listing of who&apos;s who of Hollywood. But let&apos;s do it anyways: We have the patriarch and matriarchs (Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon); we have the up-and-comers excited for their big day (Ben Barnes and Amanda Seyfried); and then we have the middle siblings who have had their time in the spotlight and are starting to fade away (Topher Grace and Katherine Heigl).\n\nThe wedding revolves around lies (obviously) and religion - with Robin Williams as the drunken Catholic priest. And it also includes lots and lots of sex jokes. The surprising thing that audiences are taking away from this film, especially in spite of the decidedly negative critics&apos; responses, is that it is hilarious. Fans of the film will find themselves laughing from beginning to end. But to give you fair warning, all of the jokes are sexually-based, and I mean all of them.\n\nLaughing at the Catholic stigma of don&apos;t have sex but if you do, don&apos;t be safe; laughing at people who have too much sex; laughing at people who don&apos;t have sex; and worse of all, laughing at divorced and married couples who have sex with one another. While some of the jokes were funny, they&apos;re also responsible for creating the uneasy dynamic amongst the characters – all of whom are family (or, at least, are about to become in-laws). At times the film crosses the line from funny dysfunctional family to repulsive dysfunctional family.\n\nThe one line that &quot;The Big Wedding&quot; straddles well is that between comedy and drama. The film is effective when it moves from funny jokes to touching family honesty and back to some more funny jokes. The story lines are very predictable, and sometimes the jokes are too simple and too wrong, but it tries to add in the right amount of drama, and ultimately, it should be entertaining to fans of the genre.",

I happened upon it on HBO the other night, just in time to catch Sean Penn (not credited) playing this blond pony tailed Irishman in a bar, spouting lilty prose, and trying to buck up a hapless Woody. Hank Azaria and Woody have more weeping, shouting scenes than any chick flick I&apos;ve seen, and combined with a Cormanesque art direction, this is one classic sad sack story. I was desperate to find the remote, but was glued to my seat as Woody, the painter who only paints this one woman over an over.. finally confronts her - after she slashes her portraits at Woody&apos;s big coming out show. (in a gallery that looked like an abandoned warehouse, of the backside of the same set for Woody&apos;s &apos;loft&apos;) Hank Azaria&apos;s jealous melt down over Woody&apos;s being the &apos;guy who gets all the girls&apos; over a pool table, complete with cue ball tossing (Off Camera - &quot;hey watch where you throw that!&quot;) and cuestick smashing.. well, the movie Gods are to be thanked for not having this flick stop all of their careers. But really tune in for Sean Penn&apos;s off beat barfly - the guy does a spot on irish accent up until he reveals he&apos;s just a handy man from the valley with bon mots of relationship wisdom.. or is he? Was it God all along masquerading as an Irish wit? Not to be missed.",

Out of the three films, this one is one of the funnier instalments. Mike Myers gives a great performance as always, and Rob Lowe gives a great performance (although a very short one). I love the British 60&apos;s vibe, since I&apos;m a big vintage fan. It&apos;s a good film to put on when you&apos;re having a bad day and just need a laugh.

      "reviewBody": "As the only name we American viewers will recognize in the cast, Charlton Heston does very well in the lead role of John Thornton rugged prospector in the Klondike Gold Rush. There are two leads of course, the other being Buck the lead sled dog that Heston puts more store in than most people.\n\nIt&apos;s not a misanthropic position by any means. As anyone who lives in the frozen north on any continent, a good sled dog is still the best transportation around. One that is loyal and smart like Buck is worth more than the gold he might carry out of a strike.\n\nThe only other version I saw of this story is the one that starred Clark Gable and Loretta Young in the Thirties, That one took considerable liberties with the story. This version is faithful to Jack London&apos;s novella which came out when folks were still panning for gold in this area in 1902.\n\nYou&apos;ll not know any other names from the cast except possibly French actress Michele Mercier who plays a saloon owner in Dawson City and who would like Heston to settle down with her. But The Call Of The Wild is as strong in him as it is in Buck The Dog who discovers his second cousin the wolf and yearns for their open existence. Though the dog develops an affection for his human the same way Heston has for the dog.\n\nHeston is rugged and fine in the lead role. The non-recognition of the other players works out because it lends an air of authenticity to the film. Ken Annakin&apos;s direction is on target and the location cinematography done in the Lapland country of Norway and Finland is magnificent.\n\nHeston wasn&apos;t crazy about the film, I imagine it was one rugged location shoot for him. Still his fans should like it and I can tell you he&apos;s done worse films than The Call Of The Wild.",

Even if the movie stunk to high heaven (hello, &apos;The Swarm&apos;), at least there were enough stars to keep you from falling asleep.\n\nAlso to give credit where it is due, there is some really beautiful cinematography, especially in outdoor shots of Mia Farrow swimming and another scene of a skier trying to outdistance an avalanche is shot very well.  \n\nHowever, once the cast starts talking, the groans can begin.  Rock Hudson and Mia Farrow seem like they wouldn&apos;t even converse at a cocktail party; they are from different cinematic solar systems and should not have been paired here at all, even if they are a divorced couple.  Robert Forster is semi-interesting as an predictable love interest for Mia and an ecologist who can predict the entire movie in his first scenes if only the screenplay had allowed him.\n\nImpatient action fans - tune in one hour after it started to see the extras get killed.  Before that is alot of drama, and after that is the rescue, and that&apos;s all, folks.",

The acting is amazing from everyone but Shirley MacLaine steals the show. This coming from a huge admirer of Hepburn. Heart breaking and wonderfully filmed, the &quot;Children&apos;s Hour&quot; is a terrific movie. See it!"

      "reviewBody": "Reunion in France (1942)\n\nFirst important fact: this movie, about the first year of WWII when Hitler took over France, was released a month before &quot;Casablanca.&quot; It does not compare in most ways with the drama, the humor, the writing, the music, the velocity, and the legendary actors of the more famous movie. But it is a very good movie with an interesting early pro-American, pro-French message. Joan Crawford crackles as much as she can in a topsy turvy role, going from spoiled and frivolous rich woman Michele de la Becque to (briefly) a refugee to, finally, an ordinary woman fighting with all her heart for France. \n\nThere are two male actors with important roles and they couldn&apos;t be more different. One is Michele&apos;s lover and fiancé, played with a cultured perfection by Philip Dorn, a Dutch actor who pulls off the pan-Euro, mostly French aristocrat and businessman well. Opposite him in every way is the homey, tough, humble American who shows up halfway through the film, John Wayne. I don&apos;t know if this really makes sense in the film, but I can see it on paper, since Wayne played a non-cowboy merchant seaman in the terrific John Ford film which prefigures this one in some ways, &quot;The Long Voyage Home.&quot; He doesn&apos;t seem as wily and smart as a fugitive from the Nazis would have to be, behind the lines in occupied Paris, but he at least plays the role of an ordinary American ready to help the French, and this is the political message throughout.\n\nIn fact, the movie borders on a brilliant propaganda device, putting message ahead of plot now and then, just perceptibly. Crawford is so good even her speeches make a convincing case, and I&apos;m assuming American audiences cheered her on by December of 1942 when it was released (on Christmas day). The scenes of the Germans taking over Paris are always horrifying, and they are again here. There is even a deliberate homage to Soviet director Eisenstein when a baby carriage runs off after the mother is killed by gunfire.\n\nBut back to &quot;Casablanca.&quot; It&apos;s an interesting problem to solve, feeding the American audience worried about the war and about U.S. involvement. Because Hollywood was both a symptom of public opinion and a shaper of it, and these are two rather different kinds of films with very similar messages. Director Jules Dassin, who is not French but American, had just started making films in 1941, and there is a sense of expertise at the expense of intuitive magic. &quot;Reunion in France&quot; is strong, smart, and convincing. But it doesn&apos;t sizzle or build the aura of the time like it could. And yet, in its defense, it has no perspective at all on the events, since it was made while they were unfolding, even before they were unfolding since it has to anticipate to some extent how the film will settle six months after being written and shot. Watch it. It&apos;s really good.",

It is one of those films that would have worked fine as a 90 minute movie--even with some flaws.\n\nBut , anyway, this film goes on for about two hours, long after the viewer&apos;s interest has begun to wander and you&apos;ve started scratching your head, wondering exactly what is happening.\n\nToward the end it kind of degenerates into overly long scenes of people running around in blasted, derelict industrial buildings breathing very hard into their microphones and shouting uninspired, predictable dialogue.\n\nSome things just aren&apos;t very dramatic. Longish scenes of people poking around in pretty much abandoned industrial settings looking for stuff and breathing hard into their microphones isn&apos;t dramatic.\n\nBy the end, we are working our way through a checklist of horror movie clichés in excruciatingly slow motion. Ancient horror movie clichés have to be executed with a certain cleverness, a certain panache, and perhaps a little inventive camera work/cutting. Some snappy dialogue, some attitude. Or maybe you just have to get them out of the way fast. That&apos;s not what happens in this film.\n\nThe premise is rather interesting, but some of the exposition kind of conflicts with the stated premise--unless the stated premise was a red-herring. It&apos;s hard to tell from what they give you on screen and the film didn&apos;t motivate me to try to figure it out.\n\nSo, nice idea, good start ... really, really slow, pretty much unimaginative ending.\n\nMaybe if they had had a bigger special effects budget ...",

Indeed I WAS a fan of Jay Chou but recently he has let me down by both his singing and acting career. The movie &quot;Bu neng shou de mi mi&quot; made a good impression on me while Chou&apos; latest movie is just a piece of crap!I really feel sorry for Chou&apos;s fans and ex-fans who put their trust in this unbearable movie. I could not understand how Jay Chou would acted as badly as he did in this movie. His appearance which made him look like a 40-year-old miserable man was extremely ridiculous (but it helped in some way &apos;cuz Chi Ling is 5 year older than him!) Can anyone who has watched this film find the 2 main characters (played by Chou and Chi Ling)feel for each others? Besides, the action scenes were pompous with nothing worth seeing. And Chi Ling&apos;s acting contributed greatly to the failure of this movie. When you look at her &quot;acting skills&quot;, her facial expressions, you find nothing. She made you think that when she smiled it was not that she was cheerful and there were nothing sad enough to cry for when she cried (her reaction after being informed about her father&apos; death is a great example)I wonder why such a model could have been selected to act in a movie? I have a piece of advice to you all: if you don&apos;t mind being treated or wasting your time, go see this movie!",

Robeson and his men claim the horses are theirs and when the kid raises a fuss they have him falsely arrested for theft. After a quick trial, he ends up in a prison run by a strict warden (Henry Silva) and his right hand tough man (Raimund Harmstorf). Naturally, we gets lots of harassment and torture before he breaks out hellbent on clearing his name. Fabrizio De Angelis loved him some Arizona around this time and this plays like a rehearsal for THUNDER WARRIOR II (1987), right down to the car stunts, prison fights and Bo Svenson as the sheriff (I like to think he is the same character in this as the THUNDER WARRIOR flicks). I love that the film ends with the law overlooking all the damage Wayne has caused after he produces a bill of sale showing the horses were his. Wayne has zero personality so he is coasting on looks (and name) here. He also did OPERATION NAM with De Angelis after this. He did get one smile out of me when he is on the phone and tells someone to call him back at 867-5309. That probably flew over the heads of the Italians.",

Lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. She says she&apos;s an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. Later, Lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees Selden performing as a cute song &amp; dance girl at an industry party he&apos;s attending. She runs out of the party and Lockwood chases after her, but he&apos;s too late. While he tries to track her down, he, Lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927--made much more difficult by the fact that Lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like Fran Drescher in &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1993).\n\nAside from the more serious aspects of the plot, Singing in the Rain is a great success as a romance and a musical. It also has an astoundingly rich Technicolor look, and it is charmingly humorous. Kelly and Reynolds click on screen, even if offscreen Kelly, who also co-directed and co-choreographed, was famously difficult to work with--he drove Reynolds so hard (she was a much more inexperienced dancer) that her feet literally started bleeding at one point. The songs are great, they&apos;re worked into the story well--which is perhaps surprising given that most of them weren&apos;t written specifically for this film--and the choreography is impeccable, frequently jaw dropping and always aesthetically wondrous and sublime. If for nothing else, the film is worth a look for its often-athletic dance numbers, which can resemble Jackie Chan&apos;s showy martial arts stunts as much as dancing. It&apos;s also imperative viewing for cultural literacy in the realm of film.\n\nBut the more serious aspects of the plot are fascinating as well. In a significant way, Singing in the Rain is about film technology. Film technology is the hinge of the plot, after all. The climax and dénouement are decided by the advent of synchronized sound in the film industry. We see studio head R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) demonstrating sound films at the party where Lockwood sees Selden for the second time, providing two big turning points at once. There are sequences of actors heading off to diction coaches, as happened in reality once sound entered the scene, and also in reality as in the film some actor&apos;s careers were jeopardized by having to suddenly master a new skill.\n\nBut Singing in the Rain is about technology on another level, too. Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen go to great lengths to ensure that the film is an exemplar of state-of-the-art film technology in 1952. For example, the beautiful Technicolor cinematography is emphasized by the fabulously colorful costumes and production design--they&apos;re showing off cutting edge color. The sound is as good as it could be in 1952, and the fact that this is a musical helps show that off. The sets and effects are complex and an attempt is made to show them off as well.\n\nDonen and Kelly often play up the artificiality of the sets and effects to emphasize artistry and technology. This is clearly shown in the &quot;Make &apos;Em Laugh&quot; sequence (and surrounding events) and the extended &quot;Broadway Rhythm Ballet&quot; sequence with Cyd Charisse. Showing off this artistry and technology also occurs very subtly, as with the rain in the &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; sequence. Even today, rain machines are frequently employed in a way that it appears to be raining on film, but in reality, it&apos;s just enough coverage to produce the illusion. In the &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; sequence, they make sure that you can see the whole area is getting flooded, and they use Gene Kelly&apos;s umbrella, as torrents of water bounce off of it, to emphasize that no matter where he goes, &quot;rain&quot; is pouring down on him.\n\nWhile there are many musicals I like as much as Singing in The Rain, this is one of the better-loved examples of that genre, and for good reason. Any musical lover has surely seen this already, and if not, they should run out now and pick it up on DVD. If you&apos;re relatively unfamiliar with classic Hollywood musicals, this is one of the best places to start.",

Why do i like the movie ? Whenever you ask older people about what defined &quot;West Germany&quot; after the lost war, there are basically three things mentioned: The Currency Reform to &quot;Deutschmark&quot;, the Return of the 10.000 POW from Russia and the Miracle of Bern as the leading one. And the movie, as good as i can imagine it, captured it very well if you hear comments from the same people watching. Yes, there are no mountains between Essen and Bern and quite sure no Car Transport Trains between Suisse and Germany in 54, but who cares ? But they did poke some fun about women&apos;s equal (baby naming) rights and the real copyrights for the German National Coaches high quality punch lines and they had the final about right. I can always enjoy it !",

By showing the overacting and crew shots in the movie, perhaps it was the director&apos;s way of commenting on the the shaky reality of the Idiots existence.\n\nBut even though we know that it&apos;s a feature film trying to be a documentary, we are still drawn to the vicarious experience of the movie - we still enjoy it as a movie. Perhaps another statement about finding happiness in a fake reality?\n\nLike Idiots, the audience goes into an escaped reality when they go to the cinema, hoping to experience what the protagonists feel on screen. But like the idiots, the denial is only temporary. The final fate of Karen seems to warn the the audience that at the end of the day, this escaped formed of reality is no match to the &quot;real&quot; world that is out there."

This one is much more uglier and grittier. The FX works quite well. The one thing that&apos;s obviously inferior is the caliber of actors. This is strictly straight to video.

Is there a connection between the missing man and the monster roaming the area? \n\nNo bones about it, this is a terrible movie. Were it to be remade (heaven forbid) this might actually be alright, because the plot is not awful for a monster movie. But the execution! Oh, man! Poor editing, awful sound (many times conversations are hardly audible or are reverberating), nasty lighting that washes everything out (which is made worse by poor prints, no doubt). Widely considered one of the worst films ever made, it has earned that honor.\n\nWhat makes it interesting, though, is that despite being a piece of garbage, it was actually made by two great independent filmmakers -- H. G. Lewis and Bill Rebane, the godfather of the Wisconsin film industry. Perhaps even more interesting is a man named Rick Paul who acts in a small role. After this, he apparently stayed out of movies for twenty years before resurfacing in &quot;Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer&quot; as a victim and the film&apos;s art director. Odd! (Though not that odd given the Chicago connection.) \n\nNone of this makes up for it being a terrible movie, though. Watch it at your own risk.",

While I was growing up, prior vcr tapes and dvd players, I and my friends would wait all year to view the various Christmas specials that aired each year.  I remember sitting glued to the tv taking in every second of the shows.  Back then if you missed part of the show or even the whole show you were border line depressed because you knew you couldn&apos;t see it again for a whole year. In some ways anticipation made the viewing of Christmas specials that much better.\n\nSANTA CLAUS IS COMIN&apos; TO TOWN(SCICTT) is in my top five Rankin/Bass specials.  Right along with RUDOLPH, FROSTY and The Year WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS.  I enjoy the 1970&apos;s feel this classic has.  The flowers that appear when Jessica sings, the simple toys the kids play with and the songs that are sung throughout this show.  I can only imagine what a modern version of this show would sound like with its boy band sounding songs and electric toys and video games.  Instead of watching Kris and Jessica court each other and wed we would probably see them live together while they consider marriage.  This was a scary classic.  The Winter Warlock was very scary when I viewed this as a kid.  No matter how many times I saw this as a kid I would always wonder if Kris would make it past the warlock.\n\nI suppose the best thing about this type of Christmas classic is that when people my age view it they can escape back to their innocent youth for a short while.  Even though I now own the vhs of SCICTT and soon hope to purchase the DVD I make myself and my kids wait until Christmas season to watch it.  It&apos;s not quite the same as when I was a kid but anticipation still increases the viewing pleasure once we do watch it."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;You gonna sit there and mope or do you want to help me stop the, you know, an apocalypse?&quot; After things go very very wrong while out on a bust Boston PD officer Nick (Reynolds) is killed but before he heads to his judgement he is swept into an office and offered a new job. He is now a member of the R.I.P.D. and along with his new partner Roy (Bridges) they set out to capture the Dead-O&apos;s that roam free. When Nick finds a connection between the Dead-O&apos;s and his death things turn personal. I have to start off by saying that I wasn&apos;t really expecting this to be good at all. I&apos;m not sure why but when I say the preview I immediately expected another Men In Black and didn&apos;t think it was needed. While I won&apos;t say this wasn&apos;t Men In Black like, it was much better then I expected and did laugh and was entertained most of the way through. This is very much geared toward a young teen crowd but I still found it funny. I do have to say though that without Reynolds and Bridges this may have been unwatchable. I did like it and am glad I saw it but this isn&apos;t something I&apos;d watch again, but keep in mind I expected this to be as bad as all the reviews it got. A combination of Men In Black with a dash of Howard The Duck thrown in. Watchable but really only once. Overall, not even close to as bad as the reviews made it seem, watch it and make up your own mind. I give it a B.",

Based on a play by Vidal, this is a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the political machinations on the campaign trail.

Fonda is the decent, old-school liberal while Robertson is his ruthless, right-leaning rival. Both turn in excellent performances. The standout in the fine supporting cast is Tracy as a former president who must decide which candidate to endorse. This is an ideal companion piece to &quot;Advise and Consent,&quot; made a couple of years earlier and also starring Fonda.",

Maybe that&apos;s not the best metaphor, nevertheless, there is something missing. The song the story revolves around is pretty good when sung by the young lead male, but whatever rendition Bridges&apos; character sings, cuts it off at the knees. It loses the spark that makes it modern and alive, and it feels more like a b-side from the 70&apos;s. The side plot, if that&apos;s what you call it, was good, with the two young guys talking and dealing with stuff. The movie starts off really good, to be honest, Bridges kind of makes it a bit of a bummer. I don&apos;t know why. Maybe he played the character too well.",

      "reviewBody": "In &quot;Hostel&quot;, a group of young men end up at a hostel in Slovakia that kidnaps people for its clients to torture and kill. Now, a group of American girls ends up at the same hostel. Will they meet the same fate, or perhaps they&apos;ll have more luck? And what ever became of the kids from the first film? \n\nFull disclosure: I didn&apos;t like &quot;Hostel&quot; very much. I loved &quot;Cabin Fever&quot;, but grew weary of Eli Roth after his second feature. So &quot;Hostel 2&quot; sat unreviewed for several month before I finally broke down and watched it. Guess what? We have a sequel that eclipses the original in every way -- this one is pretty amazing. Relying far less on torture and excessive nudity (although both are present here), we get an actual plot, likable characters and best of all a glimpse into the other side.\n\nTorture clients aren&apos;t just faceless monsters in &quot;Hostel 2&quot;, but real people with hopes, dreams and fears. There is a depth and complexity to them that allows us to almost sympathize with their angle, no matter how reprehensible they may be. (Some of them are still just ruthless killers, of course.) At one point, a potential murderer raises a philosophical point posed in the past by Hobbes, Rousseau and Locke: without laws, how is man naturally going to respond to others in a state of nature? To some degree, they attempt to answer this question. (&quot;Battle Royale&quot; also addressed this, though the characters in that film were in a more forced and less natural environment.) \n\nFocusing on a female cast rather than male one really helps, I think. Let&apos;s assume the audience (mostly male) wants to see beautiful women, which I think is a safe assumption. In the first film, to accomplish this the boys had to come across numerous loose women with no character development. Visually appealing, sure -- but no substance. By having a female cast, the male audience gets to watch the young ladies the majority of the time while also developing a plot and character motivations. Nudity is less prevalent (but still present). Roth is fully capable of telling a story, as this movie shows, and I&apos;m glad he chooses this over the shock value of sex and torture.\n\nThe cast is interesting. Rick Hoffman, who was &quot;The American client&quot; in the first film, returns as &quot;the American businessman&quot;. He is something of an anti-hero. While we ought to be against him (he&apos;s after the protagonists), the film gives us the point of view that he&apos;s just being human, no matter how awful he comes across. Another great cameo is Ruggero Deodato, the maestro of Italian cannibal films (&quot;Last Cannibal World&quot; and &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;). He appears, appropriately, as the Italian cannibal. His scene was not initially in the script (Roth showed up on Deodato&apos;s set personally to invite him to Prague) but I think it really clinches the deal of providing us a film that is both new and also giving homage to the classic.\n\nAlthough you have to see &quot;Hostel&quot; to fully understand &quot;Hostel 2&quot;, I think the punishment is worth the reward. For everything the first film lacked, the second makes up for it and then some. Romance, comedy, torture... a truly well-rounded horror film, which is a growing rarity in this age of shock cinema. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Of course this movie from 1974 was one I had never heard about. And happening to stumble upon the movie by sheer, random luck here in 2024, I opted to give the movie a chance. Sure, I wasn&apos;t exactly harboring the biggest of expectations to a sci-fi movie one year older than myself. But still, I decided to give the movie a fair chance and check out what directors Gerry Anderson, Cyril Frankel, Jeremy Summers and David Tomblin had to offer.\n\nAs for the storyline in the movie, then I can&apos;t claim that I was particularly impressed or overly entertained by the script and storyline that writers Gerry Anderson and David Tomblin put together. But I am sure that a diehard sci-fi fan would be getting a much bigger kick out of watching &quot;Invasion: UFO&quot; than I did.\n\nI don&apos;t think I was actually familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list, but that is actually something I enjoy when I sit down to watch a movie. The acting performances in the movie were definitely fair.\n\nI assume that had I watched the TV series I would have been way more well-versed in the characters, locations, events, and such that took place in this 1974 movie.\n\nThe music in the movie was somewhat odd. It felt very much off in comparison to the themes and tropes of the movie.\n\nThe effects in the movie were actually not bad. Sure, it was clearly obvious that many of the models were nothing more than toy models and being used in a model scale diorama, but it looked quite adequate actually, especially when taking into consideration the likes of the old Japanese &quot;Godzilla&quot; movies and how atrocious the toy models looked in those movies. It should be noted that &quot;Invasion: UFO&quot; was definitely an ambitious project, and it wasn&apos;t actually all that poorly executed on the screen. I was genuinely surprised with how they pulled off the effects throughout the course of the movie.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Invasion: UFO&quot; lands on a five out of ten stars.",

      "reviewBody": "Koji Yakusho has a lot in common with Jimmy Stewart. He often plays a bemused everyman to whom the most awful things happen. This movie puts his character in precisely that position. It&apos;s not just a mystery, but it&apos;s also a satire on the Japanese national obsession with getting kids into the best schools at any price.\n\nYakusho&apos;s character, Sunsuke Namiki stands outside of that obsession, as a self-made successful former dropout, so he doesn&apos;t buy into his wife&apos;s insistence on getting their daughter into an elite high school as fervently as his wife would like. In many of the scenes at the tutoring retreat in the country, he&apos;s isolated from the other parents, who function more cohesively as a group in typical Japanese fashion. But he does try, because he loves his daughter with all his heart.\n\nHe has another problem, in the form of his mistress, who visits the kind of trouble on him and the others at the tutoring retreat that gets her killed. How and why are not as they seem, and the ending is worthy of any of Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s darkly funny mysteries.\n\nThis is not just Koji Yakusho&apos;s movie. Every actor, maybe with the exception of Shingo Tsurumi, gives a great performance. Tsurumi&apos;s choices seemed two-dimensional and a little over the top, but that may be more a function of the way the character was written: more than a little paranoid. I had not seen Hiroko Yakushimaru before. She was brilliant as Minako Namiki. Akira Emoto turned in another fine performance as yet another kind of weird, creepy guy. He seems to be stuffed with an endless supply of them. Etsushi Toyokawa (as the tutor, Masaru Tsukumi) and Yuko Mano (as Namiki&apos;s mistress, Eriko Takashina) give us people with hidden agendas and different facets to their characters, ranging from earnest and sincere to bloodlessly cynical.\n\nThe music is minimal, sometimes nothing more than an electric bass playing a simple melody, and exactly what is needed to make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.\n\nVisually, it is stunning for its locations and interiors and the way the shots tell the story, with people moving in and out of the frame. There is a departure from that with a hand-held camera sequence of an argument between the Namikis that puts their fight in the pit of the viewer&apos;s stomach.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Merry go Round&quot; tells the timeless story of a young girl falling in love with another boy than chosen by her father. At this moment the same story in a slightly more complicated form is told in &quot;The peasants&quot; (2023, DK- and Hugh Welchman).\n\nThe merit of the film is however not in the story told, but in the way it is told. Only minimal use is made of spoken dialogue. Most of the emotions are conveyed by way of: facial expression / close ups; camera movements; framing (are characters close or distant in space).\n\nThe film is slow paced and every scene gets the time it requires. Every scenes has his function in the plot, but to me two scenes did stand out.\n\nIn the first place the opening scene about the yearly carnival. The scene makes very clear that this is THE happening of the year in the otherwise quiet village, the youth making fun and the adults doing business. It is also in this scene that Mari (the girl) falls in love with Maté (the boy) while at the same time Sandor approaches her father about a marriage, laying the foundation for the rest of the film.\n\nIn the second place the dancing scene. On the last wedding before that of Sandor and Mari, Maté graps his change and asks his love (still a free girl) to dance. She agrees, ... and how. Much to the chagrin of Sandor the dance becomes ever more passionate, the camera moving along with the dancing couple. This (long) scene reminded me of the famous dancing scene in &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot; (1963, Luchino Visconti).\n\n&quot;Merry go round&quot; was directed by Zoltan Fabri. He is a famous Hungarian director, two of his films being nominated for an Academy Award for Best foreign language film. Until &quot;Merry go round&quot; he was unknown to me. Being a film buff for more than 30 years I still discover new directors every couple of years. That&apos;s how rich film history is!\n\nThe film was released in 1956, which was also the year of the Hungarian uprising against the Communist rule. This made me wonder if there was some relationship between political activism and artistic freedom in movies the way we saw it in the Czech new wave. This is however not the case. Politcally the film is very correct in the Communist sense.\n\nLover Maté works for a collective and is for self determinatian in marital affairs.\n\nSandor and the father of Mari are free farmers. They are very conservative in marital affairs. They treat a marriage as a business oppurtinity (&quot;Land marries land&quot;).\n\nOnly Mari has real character development. Loyal to her father at first, she finally stands up for her freedom.\n\nOnly approximately ten years after &quot;Merry go round&quot; did Hungarian cinema become innovative with directors such as Miklos Jancso (&quot;The red and the white&quot;, 1967) and Istvan Szabo (&quot;Love film&quot;, 1970).\n\nThe character of Maté was played by actor Imre Soos. He passed away a year later, only 27 years old. The circumstances surrounding his dead (he was found together with his wife) indicated a double suicide, but conspiracy theories never went away completely.",

      "reviewBody": "Andy Rooney met Clark Gable in England while Gable was in the Eighth Air Force. Rooney described him as smiling, friendly, and impeccably dressed in tailored officer&apos;s pinks. He looked as if he&apos;d just stepped out of a poster. And why not? Gable didn&apos;t have to serve but enlisted anyway. He flew only five missions but on one of them, two of his crew were killed. And who would the public rather look at -- a cinematic icon in a tailored uniform or some grease monkey in olive drab? The moguls in Hollywood were wringing their hands over the prospect of their Number One screen idol being shot down and Gable was finally discharged in 1944.\n\nHe narrates this documentary of the group he served with, the 351st bomb group, consisting of a few dozen B-17s, and he appears on screen once in a while, bantering with the gunners and so forth. Gable was part of a six-man motion picture unit. The writer was John Lee Mahin, a veteran of the old school and a man with an all-encompassing sense of humor. Everyone should read his satire of James Joyce&apos;s &quot;Ulysses,&quot; focusing on movie production. (Last sentence: &quot;Yes, yes. But on a higher plane.&quot; Something like that.\n\nIt&apos;s not possible to watch this film without comparing it to William Wyler&apos;s similar &quot;Memphis Belle,&quot; and the latter is far less hokey. Mahin seems to have been writing less to inform the public about the operations of the 8th Air Force and more to reassure the good folk back in Martinsville, Indiana, that we were dishing out more than we were taking, and that our boys were going to church regularly and visiting museums in England. &quot;Men, that church is more than 900 years old,&quot; says Gable&apos;s voice, and we see the men remove their caps as they stare at it.\n\nThe combat footage is reserved for the climactic last ten minutes and it&apos;s exciting, if a bit more confused that that of &quot;Memphis Belle.&quot; Of course any film about warfare -- and about strategic bombing in particular -- raises questions no one really wants to face. Questions such as: Exactly who is under those bombs? The post-war Strategic Bombing Survey asked questions like that and the results were far from comforting. As a means of settling differences, people killing other people is a disadvantage from the point of view of the species, that is Homo sapiens.",

      "reviewBody": "I was always interested in viewing a Bobby Watson vehicle. Recently I purchased this film solely for that reason. Film historians tell us that Mr. Watson was a dead ringer for Adolf Hitler and I had to see this for myself. Watson only shows up in the film after about two thirds of the way through.\n\nAll in all, this film is so bad that it&apos;s pathetic. Putting aside propaganda reasons, it boggles the imagination why an accomplished actor like Ward Bond (Gentleman Jim, Wagon Train, Gone With the Wind) would actually star in such a farce. My only guesses are that 1) he was hard up for money or 2) he felt it was his patriotic duty to do this stinker.\n\nThe Nazis in this film are shown to be idiotic boobs and incompetent to the point of not even being able to keep POWs from escaping from Dachau. Actually, Dachau wasn&apos;t even used as a POW camp. At any rate, that aside, they are depicted as a group of nincompoops, much like the ones in the TV program, Hogan&apos;s Heroes. I always thought that Stalag 17 spawned the idea for Hogan&apos;s Heroes, but now I think that Hitler Dead or Alive may have been the movie that influenced Bing Crosby to air that TV classic!!\n\nSimply put, this movie is nonsensical, moronic and unrealistic. It&apos;s worth the time to view it once, just for laughs, but to view it a second time is a waste of time!",

Joey goes along with it but quickly decides to use his powers for what comes naturally - stealing lots of do re mi. This causes conflict as you can imagine, and then his invisibility goes on the fritz. Faust is played by Douglas Kennedy who played one of the cops in &apos;Invaders From Mars&apos;, the baddie is James Griffith who had a bit part in Kubrick&apos;s &apos;The Killing&apos;, and the movie was directed by Edward G. Ulmer who made the strange Lugosi/Karloff classic &apos;The Black Cat&apos; back in the 1930s. &apos;The Amazing Transparent Man&apos; won&apos;t change your life, but it&apos;s entertaining enough. Worth a look for fans of 1960s/60s b-grade thrillers."

In the meanwhile, Anthony&apos;s gang will round up all the cattle from the two ranches, change brands, and sell them at market. It&apos;s up to Hoppy, Red, Uncle Ben, and Johnny Nelson (who is a target for Meeker&apos;s hands since Johnny is sweet on Meeker&apos;s daughter Mary) to clear the Bar 20&apos;s name and round up the outlaws. The film is a very good entry in the opening film of the Hopalong series, but far from the best, since the action doesn&apos;t really begin past the halfway point of the film. Then on it&apos;s gets better building up to a great climax. Good performances by the cast (especially by Hayes as Uncle Ben, in a pre Windy Halliday role), but Thomson is miscast and ineffective as Anthony. Rating, based on B westerns, 6.",

Being a Sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad. I figured it was just Sandler haters. I couldn&apos;t have been more wrong.\n\nWhat we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny. That is actually quite an accomplish. You&apos;d think in a 90 minute comedy, they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing. But no, it&apos;s just horrible. It&apos;s not &quot;so bad it&apos;s good&quot;, its just bad. You cannot laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle, but they never come.\n\nHave you seen the movie The Ring? Where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? If this movie was on the video tape, people would die instantly, by their own hand, and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended, and that would be the first smile since they pressed play.\n\nYou might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to curb your curiosity. Don&apos;t. Please don&apos;t. Trust me, I&apos;m doing you a favor.

Even on a cute kids movie level, this film is quite horrid and comes off more creepy than sweet, which was its main goal. The movie is awful on every level and this includes the performances, which range from bad to suicide worthy. Meat Loaf has been good in several films but he&apos;s really bad here. The Loaf goes over the top and his performance is all over the place as if he doesn&apos;t know what to do. Chantellese Kent plays the young girl who befriends the yeti and she turns in one of the worst performances from a child actor. The screenplay is all over the place as well and the jokes are way too forced to work. The director apparently realized this was going to be junk because I can&apos;t see any signs of actual directing being done."

      "name": "An Opera Film By A Director Who Hates Opera!?!",
      "reviewBody": "Given the prohibitive costs of shooting and marketing a film - any film, on any subject - any director rash enough to try a &quot;filmed opera&quot; faces a double challenge. It is no longer enough to make an Opera Film: the sort popular in Italy in the 40s and 50s, when opera still enjoyed a wide audience. It is now necessary to make an Opera Film For People Who Hate Opera: one with enough populist appeal to win over millions of film-goers who are either indifferent to opera or can&apos;t bear it.\n\nIt&apos;s a well-nigh impossible trick, and only a handful of directors have come anywhere close to pulling it off. Still, I defy even the most tone-deaf of operaphobes to watch Powell and Pressburger&apos;s 1951 Tales of Hoffmann or Losey&apos;s 1979 Don Giovanni or Zeffirelli&apos;s 1982 La Traviata, and not adore every moment! As for Benoit Jacquot&apos;s new film of Tosca...well, he seems to have gone one better than all the others, and turned out the first-ever Opera Movie By A Director Who Obviously Hates Opera, So Why Did He Bother In The First Place?\n\nWith its thunderous blood-and-sex soaked libretto and romantically hysterical score, Giacomo Puccini&apos;s Tosca is perhaps the greatest melodrama - spoken or sung - ever to hit the stage. As TS Eliot once wrote of a novel by Wilkie Collins; &quot;It has no merit beyond melodrama, but it has every merit that melodrama can have.&quot; No piece of musical theatre on earth is less suited to the odious cod-Brechtian &apos;distancing devices&apos; that Jacquot employs in his deluded attempts to seem avant-garde. If you cannot wallow in the heart-thumpingly overwrought melodramatics of Tosca, you should not go near them at all.\n\nSo what can be the logic of splicing in black-and-white footage of the high-priced cast as they record the vocal score? Or those awful jiggly, grainy shots of those monuments in Rome where the action takes place? Or forcing Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorgiu - the reigning Golden Couple on the international opera scene - to speak the dialogue &apos;live&apos; while singing it on the soundtrack? This sort of hollow trickery can only outrage opera fans, while leaving the vast majority of the public as bewildered as they ever were.\n\nSo Jacquot is both a Philistine and a moron, and his film should be an out-and-out disaster BUT...lacking even the courage of his own puny convictions, most of the time he forgets to be Post-Modern and just gives us the melodrama straight. The result is nothing short of miraculous. As Floria Tosca, an opera diva struggling to save her lover from the clutches of an evil Chief of Police, Angela Gheorghiu is - vocally and dramatically - a rival to our memory of Maria Callas. With her torrent of raven hair, triumphal cheekbones and sulphurous eyes, her screen presence is an echo of Sigourney Weaver.\n\nA pity that her most erotic love interest is not the romantic and revolutionary painter Mario Cavaradossi. (Roberto Alagna, aka Mr. Gheorghiu, lags far behind his wife in vocal skills and shows not the faintest sign of talent as an actor.) Rather, it is the evil police chief Baron Scarpia who deserves to win her heart. Not only a veteran of opera films - including Losey&apos;s sumptuous Don Giovanni - Ruggero Raimondi has also acted &apos;straight&apos; roles, notably as a dotty French nobleman obsessed with immortality in the 1983 Alain Resnais film La Vie Est Un Roman. With his haggard eyes and glittering black greatcoat, Raimondi has an almost vampiric quality. Perhaps the sexiest, most seductive screen villain since Basil Rathbone.\n\nAnd so - irony of ironies - this Opera Film By A Director Who Hates Opera turns out to be a near-classic, a close rival to Zeffirelli or Losey or Powell-Pressburger. Let&apos;s just hope that nobody ever gives Jacquot another opera to direct. Next time, he might really wreck it! Let&apos;s hope, on her next project, that Angela Gheorghiu wields her ever-increasing clout and hires a film-maker who actually knows what opera is. Isn&apos;t Gerard Corbiau in need of a job? Now that I&apos;d love to see.\n\nDavid Melville"

Not at all apologetic and a testament to faith and hope in a futile, provincial and incestuous post war Europe. You feel their hunger and desperation. So revealing a film, yet it left so much unanswered. Post war French cinema is timeless and classic."

For our family is devastating for not acknowledge her talent and idea of modern view in cinematography.

I have tried for many years to find a source for this film, but I doubt that it exists anywhere now other than in some obscure film vault in France.

Matt Frewer turns in a good &quot;Dad&quot; role. The acting is pretty good on all counts, and it&apos;s creepy enough to watch once or twice, with a great &quot;Whodunit&quot; kind of twist between various characters. Cool scenes shot in a run-down camp trailer park, in an incomplete building, etc.",

      "reviewBody": "Kung Fu Master is about a 14 y/o who fell head over heals with his classmates mother, who shockingly returned the favor. It is very &apos;French&apos; at that. Other quirks of the film is that it is family affair. Its stars Charlotte Gainsborough and her mom Jane Birkin, and Varda&apos;s son Matthew.\n\nI definitely watched this brand of &apos;French&apos; films.\n\nMore about a study of the extends of Human Sexuality under cut with smart Social Commentary. This time around AIDS, and the idea of loving someone with a certain kind of baggage.\n\nI always have a rule with this film with moral bent.\n\nIf its actively trying to be weird and tries to remove the moral compass of the situation, it kind of fails. This falls deeply in that category. Jane Birkin&apos;s character is so enthused by the attention AND I felt that the two times in the film that this situation actually is placed on the spot is not enough against how many times Varda tries to &apos;dramatize&apos; and &apos;make sense&apos; of the situation. It clearly does not irk a lot since the male character is not as sexualized AND given the free reign as the active pursuer of the relationship. The ending does work on his end though. But her story needs more.\n\nThis is very bad. Always - there is an adult in the situation guys. She is a bad example. I hate how Varda is just trying to justify the relationship in an unironic way.\n\nWhat makes me doubly sad is that Varda directed this film wonderfully. Well photographed, well directed, and phenomenally acted. Its practically crisp. I wished that it went harder to be honest. Its a material that needs more reckoning, more reactions from others. Its too focused on her in a bad way.\n\nNot Recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "In a bid to try to improve trade links between Japan and the US Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is hired to train an army to overthrow a rebellious group of samurai led by their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). However, the army that Algren had been training encounter the Samurai before their training has been completed and the army end up being overpowered and defeated by the highly trained Samurai. Algren is the only survivor of this battle and in recognition of his bravery and determination Katsumoto spares his life and invites him to stay with the Samurai. During his time with the Samurai, Algren learns quite a bit about their culture and eventually embraces it and fights back against those that had originally hired him to overthrow the Samurai.\n\nTom Cruise&apos;s performances and films tend to vary greatly in quality so I do tend to approach a lot of his films with caution. I can safely say that this is one of his better films and also one of his better performances. Cruise is well-known for bringing a sort of smug arrogance to a lot of his roles and he definitely brings some of that to his role as Captain Algren - although there&apos;s only a whiff of it here rather than full on smugness that we&apos;ve seen from him before. Director and screenwriter Zwick gives Cruise a character he can really sink his teeth into - Algren is obnoxious and rude at the start and shows very little respect for his employees. He&apos;s the same with the Samurai at the start, but I think the difference is that the Samurai show him respect and allow him to embrace their culture. The general saying in life is that to &apos;gain respect you must first give respect&apos; and I got the feeling that this was one of the messages contained within this film.\n\nThe first 20 minutes or so of this film are slick and fast-paced, but the momentum does slow down where Algren is staying with the Samurai. Although the pace slackens at this point the film never becomes boring and Algren&apos;s narrative and the exploration of the Samurai culture were interesting enough to keep me involved with the story. The only criticism I have with this aspect of the story was when the ninjas attacked the Samurai - I just didn&apos;t see the point of it and it also seemed to add nothing to the story, but this really is a minor criticism.\n\nMuch like Seven Samurai, The Last Samurai is a slow-burning film that rewards the viewers patience with a spectacular closing act that is epic, clever and heart-breaking. Technical aspects of the film are also superb most notably the beautiful Japanese scenery and wonderful cinematography.\n\nClearly there are some politics involved here, but the politics are side-lined for the most part to make way for an interesting story about one man identifying more with an alleged &apos;rebellion&apos; group over his own people. I&apos;ve no idea how much of this story is true - it certainly references real life people such as General Custer and real-life events such as the battle of little bighorn, but never says anywhere that it&apos;s based on a true story. Truth be told, it doesn&apos;t matter to me whether the story is true or not because the film has a good story, it&apos;s moving at times, it&apos;s beautiful to look at, has some wonderful performances and to top it all the final battle is fantastic. Therefore it&apos;s very much worth seeing on its own merits.",

      "reviewBody": "This East German classic from the 50&apos;s concerning a young woman from the working classes and her struggle with upcoming Nazism is as to the political content very ambivalent. Though Maetzig refrains from a too obvious political message, at the same time the portrayal of how Nazi-political thinking is infiltrating Lissy and her family is very schematic and thereby oversimplified. Moreover, maybe also due to Sonja Sutter&apos;s superb performance, the part of Lissy is about the only character with a psychological depth, while all other parts never become more than archetypes of the different classes.\n\nNo more than outside events lead Lissy&apos;s husband to his choosing for the NSDAP (including his anti-Semitic feelings). His dismissal by his jewish boss in combination with a &quot;Juden Raus&quot; poster of the NSDAP and his middle-class background is according to this film enough to explain his anti-semitism; that already a more irrational base must have been present for anti-semitic feelings as such, probably did not fit into the materialistic and dialectic view on the world. Also the premise that the working classes were basically anti-Nazi is naive to say the least.\n\nAs to the end I think it should be said that this is not that &quot;open&quot; as it is always referred as. The last shot of the film in combination with the interior monologue hardly leaves room for any interpretation but one.\n\n That this film is considered a classic film is mainly due to the fact that Maetzig, as said, refrains from too obvious political propaganda, which was a relief from other East German anti-Nazifilms; with its political message Maetzig wants to accentuate human dignity. Maetzig also simply made a very good film with its rich in details and atmosphere portrayal of the working classes in Berlin around 1932/33 and  the busy city life in the streets.  It is fast-paced; one of those films that really start with the first shot and does not need time to get going. Maetzig was supported by superb cinematography by Werner Bergmann.",

Rumours are there in Dutch press!!!!!!!\n\nImo Bad influencers !!!",

The body count reaches a great height and the nudity and sex is as gratuitous as ever. I personally feel that this is the best of the original 4 Friday movies, coming in a close race with the third Jason. I&apos;ve seen all the movies more times than i can count and this one holds up surprisingly strong among all eleven films. For those of you who are Friday fans, if you haven&apos;t seen this one, you are missing out on a key moment in Jason&apos;s history, so go pick this one up today.",

Like coming to the end of an exceptional book, you&apos;ll hope for more, surely another way to eke out a Lisbeth Salander film to enjoy. She has become with this trilogy one of the strongest female characters in 21st century film. No wonder actresses were battling to play her--she is the equivalent to Jason Bourne in any regard. (I can&apos;t imagine Hollywood doing a better job of these films--can you?)\n\nI believe Hornet&apos;s Nest is best of the bunch. Salander is cornered, in hospital and under arrest, in danger of being recommitted to the institution that held her under guardianship. Despite her uncommunicative nature, Salander has friends, true friends who&apos;ll stick their necks out to protect her. But Salander is always willing to fight for herself, and she finds ways to do battle.\n\nHornet&apos;s Nest gives us a better film than the other in terms of suspense and dramatic flow. The pieces assemble, the foes are distinguished from the good guys, there is conflict and threat launched in surprising ways. Of the three, Hornet&apos;s Nest is the most suspenseful and best executed of the films in my opinion, a superb finish to a wonderful series.\n\nExcuse me while I start reading the books.",

Perhaps a further pair of gun-fights would be desirable: gun-fights in a western movie are like salt in the food. The film has a peculiar interest for cinephiles, since here the great director Fritz Lang confronts himself with the western genre for the first time. I think he makes a good job, even if does not seem completely at his home. Moreover we have the usual Henry Fonda&apos;s charisma and... OK... the main reason why I am interested in the movie is the presence of Gene Tierney at the very beginning of her career. I must confess that here her legendary beauty is still a bit unripe... let&apos;s say that Venus has just come out of the shell. No fear: within one year or two our eyes will rest on the highest beauty in movie history (in history at all, I dare say).",

      "reviewBody": "This movie suffers by comparison with Petr Weigl&apos;s Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk (1992), which has Shostakovich&apos;s music and singing, by means of lip-synching. That one was very dynamic; here the acting is remarkably wooden, though it gets better towards the end.\n\nIt seems that this version is based on the original story by Leskov, rather than the Shostakovich opera. Shostakovich made Katarina more sympathetic by showing her as a normal, vibrant woman driven to distraction by the cruel people surrounding her, and by the oppressive imperial system. Here she is a lustful creature who will stop at nothing to get what she wants; this turns the story into a simple morality tale without the complex interplay of the opera.\n\nThe Leskov-Wajda version establishes this with details not in the Shostakovich-Weigl: Katarina and Sergei murder a child who stands to inherit the estate; Katarina, as she&apos;s sent off to Siberia, is completely indifferent to her own child. In the Shostakovich-Weigl, Sergei&apos;s new girlfriend sings a very cruel song of triumph over Katarina.\n\n The black-and-white photography is not suited to a story like this, although the composition of images is very artistic, probably better than in the Weigl version. But it&apos;s still very slow; for instance, the flogging looks like something that might be administered by a school principal on sedatives. On the other hand, the final death scene is nicely done, it&apos;s one of the best parts of the movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Probably the biggest problem with this movie  other than its insistence that all men are either worthless sexual predators or pathetic, near-impotent panderers  is the fact that it has aged so badly. In an age when a small army of women under 30 seem hell-bent on doing all they can to turn their livers and septums to mush in as short a time as possible, Diane Keaton&apos;s Theresa Dunn no longer comes across as somebody out of the ordinary.\n\nDiane Keaton gives a performance that is by turns both sensitive and irritating as her character revolves around her schizophrenic lifestyle. As a child, Dunn was encased in plaster, a result of scoliosis, and it seems that this is what compels her to take so many risks in her effort to find the kind of freedom she was denied as a kid  both by her spell in traction and by a harsh, overbearing Catholic upbringing. She is full of love, as indicated by her relationship with the deaf children she teaches, but gives it in all the wrong ways, leading to encounters with equally warped characters. One of these is Richard Gere in the role that first brought him to Hollywood&apos;s attention and which serves as a kind of template for the role of Jesse in Jim McBride&apos;s ill-fated remake of Breathless. The other is Tom Berenger, a borderline psychopath tortured by his own homosexuality. Both are characters no right-thinking adult would want to get involved with, but Keaton&apos;s self-destructive personality draws her to them, and while you want her to break free from her sleazy night-life a part of you can&apos;t help thinking she&apos;s going to get what she deserves.\n\nThe problem with Dunn is that she engages the viewers&apos; sympathy in her straight persona then keeps pushing them away with her self-indulgent excesses and sometimes callous treatment of those who love her most. Combined with the relentlessly depressing atmosphere of impending tragedy that hangs over the entire film, this makes Looking for Mr. Goodbar a difficult film to enjoy (or even watch) and one to which many people wouldn&apos;t wish to return.",

      "reviewBody": "CARRY ON MATRON is the fourth and last of the hospital-themed CARRY ON films. It&apos;s a must for fans as it assembles a huge number of the series regulars although the sheer quantity of talent involved invariably means that some of the performers only get to shine in a scene or two (I mean you, Charles Hawtrey). The plot is an odd mix of gentle comedy and knockabout crime story, involving a gang of robbers who somewhat unbelievably decide to steal a huge quantity of pills from a maternity ward. Sid James takes a backseat here with an old-fashioned turn as the head of the criminal gang, although his &apos;Dr Zhivago&apos; gag is a highlight.\n\nElsewhere, the emphasis is on staff rather than patients for a change, although there are some nice roles for the female talent as you&apos;d expect: Joan Sims, Valerie Leon, Madeline Smith, and Margaret Nolan all contribute efficient minor turns. Less impressive is Kenneth Cope in thankfully what was to be his last role in the series; his out of place pratfalls just serve to remind you how classy Jim Dale was in comparison. It&apos;s also disappointing that the likes of Kenneth Williams, Patsy Rowlands, and Hattie Jacques have to contend with broader (read: more lowbrow) humour than before, but the quantity of gags and fast pacing means that this is hard to dislike. Kenneth Connor is a real plus.",

      "reviewBody": "Hiroshi Teshigahara&apos;s &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; is truly a unique movie. It&apos;s about an entomologist who goes on a holiday, only to find himself trapped in huge sand pit with a woman. The woman has no will to get out of the sand (it&apos;s been &quot;broken&quot;--like that of a stable horse--no doubt), but he refuses to live a &quot;meaningless&quot; life in the sand pit (like the woman). He tries to get out, but it&apos;s all in vain: the wall of sand is an impenetrable barrier between him and his &quot;freedom.&quot; And so the story goes. The sand pit, I guess, is a metaphor for humanity&apos;s existentialist plight. Like the mythological Sisyphus, who was condemned for eternity to roll a rock to the top of a hill only to have it roll back down again, the two characters in this film dig sand out of their pit--but the sand keeps coming back....which raises the question: If life is meaningless--as Satre and Camus have said--what will we do? Do we keep digging? Do we opt for suicide instead? Or what? This is one of those films that haunt you after you see it; you&apos;ll keep thinking of it during subsequent days and even weeks. It is also distinguished by its luscious and crisp black and white deep focus photography. &quot;The Woman in the Dunes&quot; is (sadly) a far too little-known cinematic treasure that is thought-provoking, beautiful, erotic, and even eerie. Once you see it, you won&apos;t soon forget it.",

True story or otherwise, this is my favourite British film for a couple of years, including last year&apos;s boy in the ballet flick. It&apos;s got that expected gentleness in the tale, in spite of the prison setting, but it seems so well made that I forgave its overly romanticised telling. David Kelly, as the terminally ill serial wife killer, was quite superb. I suppose I am being too fanciful to expect him to get a Best Supporting Actor nomination next year, but he certainly deserves it. The rest of the male cast did an adequate job, whilst Helen Mirren shone as the expert gardener. Finally, I have to mention Lucy Punch, if only to say that I was disappointed her part was not as enlarged as her midriff became. 7/10. A film which interested me from start to finish.",

Leonard Whiting ,whose only important part was Franco Zephirelli&apos;s &quot;Romeo &quot; , saw his career sinking fast with such a coarse tale .\n\nAn Austrian officer ,Franz ,is in love with Sissi (sic) but her father does not want to hear of it ,because he is poor ;so as WW1 breaks out , opportunity knocks,so to speak :he intends to cover himself with glory .\n\nPerhaps made with &quot; Tom Jones&quot; in mind , this is a bawdy story , which keeps trotting out a ludicrous situation till one can&apos;t take anymore : the hero dressed up as a woman in a house where two beautiful girls dwell ; the unfortunate officer is also wooed assiduously by a servant ,a bearded brute who resembles Rasputin ...\n\nWhy did Curd Jürgens have to get involved in that busisness?",

      "reviewBody": "Bill Murray is one of the best wise guys in the business.  I was amazed to find out on the GHOSTBUSTERS 15th Anniversary DVD that Murray had little to do with the dialogue his classicly blase, fiercely cynical &apos;Dr. Venkman&apos; cuts loose throughout this good comedy.  Credit Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis with &quot;getting into Bill&apos;s mind&quot; as Ramis puts it and presenting Murray with a gag-a-second character.  Murray also lends his own comic genius through his delivery and facial gestures (especially with his classic cross-eyed, curled-lip look).  Together with a fun premise and above average special effects, GHOSTBUSTERS will never be a relic of the 80&apos;s and should always be a refreshingly humorous spook show.\n\nMurray rules the screen, mauling his geeky para-psychologist partners and hitting on a young blonde while conducting shock therapy experiments on her. Aykroyd uses his standard machine gun delivery of obscure (or should I say made up) facts and anecdotes and Ramis is just enough for the ultra-dork &apos;Egon&apos;.  The funniest element in GHOSTBUSTERS happens to be Rick Moranis in a splendid role as a small-time accountant who has parties for clients only and becomes mixed up in some extremely supernatural events.  Along with Sigourney Weaver, Moranis has the most difficult physical tasks to topple.\n\nThis was a picture I loved when I was a kid.  I must have went some 12 to 15 years before I saw it again and I was alarmingly impressed.  It has endured. The special effects are not only good, but they are comedic and add even more laughs throughout the &apos;Busters turbulent jobs.  The DVD version has tons of goodies included and is an essential addition to any Saturday Night Live fan&apos;s movie library.  SNL is the very essence and reason for GHOSTBUSTERS, where Murray and Aykroyd starred.  Director Ivan Reitman created his meal ticket here and can pretty much do any comedy he wants now. \n\nIt is a shame John Belushi was not around to play one of the &apos;Busters, for he was originally cast.  The movie is already well-paced and engaging so just imagine how frenzied the pace would have been with Belushi. Regardless, GHOSTBUSTERS is one for the kids, teens, and adults alike.  It has spanned these phases for me and still works wonderfully. \n\n RATING: ***"

The gritty grainy quality of the image, the seemingly raw sound, provide an almost documentary feel--but the conversations among the characters are stylized and enigmatic, and grow dark, unsettling and surreal. The film seems defiantly uncinematic until you observe how what you&apos;re being shown contributes to the viewer&apos;s increasing disorientation and discomfort. I hope director Bendek Fliegauf has met with the success in his film-making career, as he is certainly a talent to be reckoned with.",

Salesgirl, fired at Christmastime from her department store job for &quot;over-selling&quot;, finds an abandoned baby on the steps outside a foundlings home but can&apos;t get anyone to believe the child isn&apos;t really hers. The spotlight this time is equally on Debbie Reynolds (doing sprightly, decent work as the bachelor mother) and then-husband Eddie Fisher (leering at the camera while playing a singing junior-executive). Supporting roles are colorfully filled, production and song numbers are decent, though the script lands us smack in the middle of Risqué 101, with misunderstandings &quot;Three&apos;s Company&quot; would envy (She has a baby but not a husband?! And who&apos;s the father?). Worth-seeing for Debbie, who sings and dances--and rolls her eyes with expert exaggeration when it&apos;s time to change a diaper. **1/2 from ****",

Good acting.\n\nAlong the way plot elements seem to be happenings that are only found in movie scripts -- small little things such as calling your love but assuming she is not home only at the second ring -- NOT real life.\n\nSuch things are not a bother when drama takes over and wins the day. Sadly, the big dramatic climax here -- clearly planned to be over-the-top -- falls a little short.\n\nThere needed to be just a little better connection between boy and girl. The director should have gave the viewer greater familiarity with the environment that is the stage for the films final scenes.  In this area, the LONG VACATION demonstrates establishing these two crucial story elements flawlessly.\n\nOne other note, Sophie Marceau is a female goddess and makes L&apos; Étudiante very much worth watching."

      "reviewBody": "It seems like every year, there&apos;s one or two films which are far from perfect but nonetheless shake us up in ways better films don&apos;t quite do. Last year, it was BULWORTH, and this year, it&apos;s ARLINGTON ROAD.  Obviously, after all that&apos;s happened this decade in America, from Waco to Oklahoma City, the time is ripe for a movie to explore the cracks in the American dream which brought about events like those.  This film ultimately asks more questions than it answers, but that may just be a condition inherent to this type of film.  More troubling is two things: (1) Though I agree with those(and I&apos;ll try not to give away too much here) who theorize the ending changes the whole perspective of the film, there are still too many key narrative cheats(a conversation Robbins supposedly had with Bridges&apos; son seems unbelievable, and the traffic light scene near the end also is) to make it fully effective; (2) The film seems a little confused of what it&apos;s about; it is a study of one man&apos;s psyche, or the nation&apos;s?\n\nStill, ARLINGTON ROAD shouldn&apos;t be dismissed.  There are troubling questions explored, and you don&apos;t have to be a conspiracy nut to believe those so-called &quot;fringe&quot; hate groups are entering the mainstream at a frightening rate for a so-called &quot;civilized&quot; society.  The ending is also powerful, and though I understand it, more than anything else, was responsible for the delays, I applaud whoever was in charge for not changing it(though again, how they got there is another story).  Bridges&apos; performance is another thing which makes more sense once you look back with the ending of the film in mind, and it doesn&apos;t seem like over-acting.  Robbins is a little more problematic; there are scenes where he&apos;s convincing, and then scenes where he goes over-the-top and shouldn&apos;t.  Hope Davis doesn&apos;t have a big part, but she injects a lot into it as usual.  But the biggest surprise here is Joan Cusack.  Anyone who thinks of her only as a (good)comic actress will be in for a shock; there&apos;s one scene involving her which is the scariest in the film.\n\nAgain, ultimately, while it leaves you with nagging doubts about the quality, ARLINGTON ROAD makes you think enough to recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Relative newcomers, writer Bill Kelly and director Mennan Yapo, have concocted a testy little conundrum of a movie titled PREMONITION: whether the audience decides to step into their little nightmare or reject the premise that powerful emotions can drive the brain to peculiar directions of functioning will be the divisive break in acceptance of the film&apos;s premise. It is a fairly well done, thought provoking experience and is carried by some better than average performances by a strong cast.\n\nThe Hanson family is introduced as the husband Jim (Julian McMahon) and wife Linda (Sandra Bullock) buy their new home. Jump forward after the credits to a family that now includes two young schoolgirls (Shyann McClure and Courtney Taylor Burness), a seemingly mildly depressed Linda and a workaholic Jim. Abruptly, Linda is informed by a police officer that Jim has died in an auto accident and her close friend (Nia Long) and mother (Irene Ziegler) help Linda through the early moments of the tragedy. Yet Linda continues to &apos;relive&apos; moments: one day Jim is dead the next he is alive, and all of the pieces of the puzzle that erode Linda&apos;s mind become clues to investigate information she doesn&apos;t want to know. She encounters a warped psychiatrist (Peter Stormare) and a possible &apos;other woman&apos; in Jim&apos;s life (Amber Valletta), and as she attempts to mold the puzzle pieces to make sense, she learns about the possible &apos;why&apos; of the mental state in which she is trapped.\n\nThe film has problems holding credibility, but then the premise is a novel enough to allow such missteps. Sandra Bullock takes over this role completely, gains our empathy, and in the end the film works because of her. She is becoming an actress who is learning the value of understatement and that aspect of her craft serves her well. No, this is not a great movie, but it is a well-produced little mystery that asks the audience to engage both mind and imagination, and that is a good thing! Grady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "The first half dozen two-reel installments of this new serial introduce a story of strong melodramatic interest, in the best sense of the word. The series of inexplicable murders, all following warnings imparted by a mysterious voice over the telephone, present a mystery that intensifies as the story proceeds. The hero-detective, Shirley, makes repeated efforts to break up the series of crimes, but is baffled in each attempt. The observer is equally baffled, for the mystery is well protected. The story was adapted by J.G. Alexander from a book by Eustace Hale Ball and produced by Stuart Paton. The construction is excellent in the opening installments, the action being well-timed and carrying the interest along with a strong sweep. Ben Wilson appears as Shirley, who attempts to unravel the series of crimes, and makes good use of his opportunities in this interesting role. Neva Gerber is also pleasing as Polly Marion, the young actress who becomes involved in the various crimes. Others who have important parts are L.M. Wells, Frank McQuarrie, Howard Crampton, Joseph Girard and Ernest Shields. An element of improbability hovers over the main conception, which gives an amusing turn to the production. This relieves the situations from the horror and unpleasantness they might otherwise arouse. Each of the murders is committed by what is termed the &quot;oriental death punch,&quot; traces of which are found above the heart of each victim. The series is to comprise fifteen installments. - The Moving Picture World, March 24, 1917"

      "reviewBody": "Thanks TCM for bringing this piece of history to a broader audience. And what a slice of the past it is. This is living next to the land, in spades. That thousand-mile trek through Arabia and the Caucuses is not just long, but harrowing, as well. It&apos;s men, women, kids, donkeys, cattle, goats, sheep, all winding their way through impossible terrain, with a few skinny dogs tagging along. Sure, it seems they do it every year to get to the mountain grassland, but I can&apos;t see it ever gets any easier. When I backpack in the snow, I&apos;ve got good warm boots and heavy socks—these folks, however, do it in, uh, bare feet!!!-- for better traction, I guess. Anyway, I&apos;m still shivering from that footage. Then there&apos;s the river crossing. That alone is worth the price of admission. You&apos;ve got to admire their herding prowess in the rapids with nothing more than inflated goatskins. In fact, I have a whole new appreciation for the lowly sheep and the gutsy herders who tend them. \n\nAs good as the footage is, questions do arise. What, for example, do they do with sick people. It seems they can&apos;t stop the trek, so I guess they just pack them along and hope for the best. Also, we don&apos;t see them eating along the way or building fires (if they do) or setting up tents. Instead, Cooper &amp; Co. track the snaking caravans only, but then that&apos;s more than enough. However, someone should have given second thoughts to some of those ridiculous title cards. But all that is merely incidental to a filmed record of a people who reach far back in time, and ones I would be proud to have as forebears. Then again, I guess I won&apos;t be complaining about having to walk to the store, any time soon."

She lashes out at her friends, her psychiatrist, and anyone else in her way. To make matters worse, Dr. Loomis has just released a new tell-all book about the events of the last film, revealing that Laurie is actually Michael Myers&apos; sister which sends her into an even deeper depression as the anniversary rolls around and Michael returns to carve up a new batch of victims.\n\nWriter/director Rob Zombie deserves a massive amount of credit for doing his own thing here. Whereas his first film felt like a less effective paint by numbers remake of John Carpenter&apos;s film with just a few of his own flourishes poking through, his sequel is one of the more interesting installments in the series.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot in this film that feels forced or out of place like most scenes with Michael Myers visiting with visions of his mother, his younger self, and a random white horse, but the dramatic moments between survivors Laurie, Annie, and Annie&apos;s father are heartbreaking and played with an unbearable amount of realism.",

Tinto is at his best when he&apos;s not taking himself seriously, and in Monamour he attempts some sort of depth that he just can&apos;t pull off. What&apos;s worse, the plot feels like a recycled version of one of his better films - 1992&apos;s Cosi fan Tutte - but with all the wrong choices made; Cosi fan Tutte was light-hearted and featured a strong female lead in Claudia Koll, who was in charge of her own fate the whole time; the lead in Monamour is a despicable and unlikable character who succumbs to the will of men around her. While the two characters end up having similar journeys, the viewer just can&apos;t forgive Monamour&apos;s Marta as he did Diana from Cosi fon tutte. And the fact that the movie takes itself so seriously makes the erotica disturbing and off-putting, unlike the playfulness in Cosi fon Tutte.\n\nMonamour has good cinematography and some well-shot sex scenes which are both a given with Tinto, but the sex is more disturbing than it is enticing. While Cosi fon Tutte was almost feminist (sort of) and is lots of fun for a couple to watch together, Monamour feels more like a horny old man&apos;s fantasy, and it just doesn&apos;t work.",

This is a film about a storybook day in San Francisco--a day when downtown was pretty much shut down to make a little boy&apos;s dream come true. The best use of city funds? Probably not. But if a city&apos;s officials can&apos;t take time to be a little silly and do something for the sheer joy and good of it, maybe it&apos;s not a city worth living in. As a San Francisco resident, I can attest that the money was well spent, coming back in the form of boundless goodwill and smiles all across the city--and all across the world, in the form of social media. For once, the lead story on the news wasn&apos;t about homelessness or crime, it was about the humanity in all of us. (And I&apos;m sure this humanity translated to lots of awareness and financial support for not only the Make-a-Wish Foundation but for many other childhood cancer organizations.) Hooray for Miles! And Hooray for San Francisco! And hooray for the director and producers of this film, who are putting the money made from the documentary right back into funding organizations that fight childhood illness.\n\nWatch Batkid Begins when you need a little mood-booster. If it doesn&apos;t lift your spirits, than you are just too far gone.",

      "name": "The Most Vile Interpretation",
      "reviewBody": "The life and unhappy end of said life for Joseph Oppenheimer, the famous Jew Suss has been interpreted in many ways over the years in a variety of medium. The most vile interpretation was that done in this 1940 film, personally produced and supervised by Joseph Goebbels.\n\nThe real Oppenheimer was out of Vienna where he had done considerable business with the Catholic Hapsburgs and moved to the Wurttemberg area where he came to the attention of the heir to Duchy of Wurttemberg who after he became Duke made Oppenheimer his first minister.\n\nDuke Karl Alexander played by Heinrich George is an ambitious fellow who would like to create a miniature Versailles over in Stuttgart an ambition that a number of German heads of state wanted to emulate including Frederick the Great over in Prussia. Ferdinand Marian as Oppenheimer is a worldly high living fellow himself who provides a number of financial schemes that increase the Duke&apos;s treasury. Of course while doing it he arouses the ire of the local Lutheran gentry. After Duke Karl Alexander dies, the burghers of Stuttgart do to Oppenheimer precisely what you see in Jew Suss.\n\nWithout the religious component the closest thing approximating this story was that of Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV&apos;s minister of finance over in France. He lived high on the hog, too high in the opinion of his king. Fouquet was however first given exile and then had the sentence commuted to life in prison.\n\nWhat Oppenheimer&apos;s story played into was a latent anti-Semitism already instilled in the population by Martin Luther. During the course of the movie the burghers of Stuttgart warn the Duke of Luther&apos;s warnings about how vile those Jews are, but the Duke fails to heed. The Catholic Hapsburg connection isn&apos;t brought in as the Austrians were now part of the Reich.\n\nThe real Oppenheimer was accused of being an agent for those Hapsburgs in real life. But here he&apos;s the agent of a deep and nebulous Jewish conspiracy to take over Wurttemberg. Today Wurttemberg, tomorrow the world. Like Jews always do, he&apos;s got designs on Aryan women and in his sites here is Krista Soderburg, a Swedish actress married to the director of Jew Suss, Veit Harlan who always played the prototype of Aryan women in German films. Her being debauched and later suicide sparks all the latent hatred against Oppenheimer that gets unleashed with the demise of Duke Karl Alexander. Her Aryan sweetheart played by Malte Jager leads the mob against Oppenheimer.\n\nAgain in real life Oppenheimer was a worldly sort who never had any trouble getting women to give up the goods. A whole lot like Fouquet over in France, but again we have the religious component here.\n\nMind you this same story had been filmed six years earlier over in Great Britain with the exiled Conrad Veidt playing Oppenheimer. In that version, Oppenheimer is endowed with saintly qualities and is a martyr, saintly qualities the real Oppenheimer probably would have scorned. It&apos;s fascinating the different spin you can give, especially if you&apos;re in the propaganda game. Joe Goebbels, the little club footed maniac who ran German cinema as part of the Propaganda Ministry, had a casting couch that dwarfed any in Hollywood and anything that Oppenheimer in real life could ever dream of.\n\nI won&apos;t put a rating on Jew Suss, this is such a vile story meant to inflame anti-Semitism and succeeding horribly. This was required viewing for people entering the S.S. those who became guards at the concentration camps. It was vile when it occurred in real life and viler yet when told by the Nazis in this film."

      "reviewBody": "There are a number of super talented actor/directors in Hollywood. One of the most prolific is James Wong. In this film which he not only wrote, but directed as well he displays what many would consider his best work to date. This is the story of Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) who accompanies his high school friends on a field trip to France. However, moments before the plane departs, Alex has a premonition the plane will explode in mid-air. Sensing he is about to die, he breaks for the exit in a violent plea to leave the aircraft. When he demands to be put off, several of his friends add to his fear by panicking. When they are asked to leave, they are held by the security police in the waiting area, where they all see the plane depart and then moments later explode in mid-air. There after things which should go better for him, having saved peoples lives, go terribly wrong. One by one all the people whom he saved begin to die mysteriously with Alex realizing he knows why. Death stalks everyone, but in this story, they are warned in advance. The movie has some horrific moments, which the audience senses become more pronounced as death arrives. Great acting by the cast makes this film a must see. ****",

Do we really want to see a) the mad scientists, the assorted weirdos, the inept cops, the horny Yetis....or do we want to see b) the beautiful women owning the screen and making out with each other? If you answered &quot;a&quot;, this is your movie. If you answered &quot;b&quot;, you will be disappointed. The erotic scenes are VERY mild, and even the climactic scene between Misty Mundae and Anoushka is over far too quickly. The film spends most of its time trying to be a comedy, but its extremely juvenile sense of humor is VERY hit-and-miss. Could have been so much better. *1/2 out of 4.",

So caught up in her dramatic wants and angry, she lies, and that lie haunts her for her remaining days. This is a movie version of a wonderful book, the best I read that year. It captures the pain and the need to make true restitution. The truth of the matter is that sometimes it just doesn&apos;t work that way. The characters come to realize that. It&apos;s a slice of life in wartime and all the chickens come home to roost. Probably the most gut wrenching thing is that the character that causes the most damage has great success in life, but carries around her guilt to her dying day. She is never allowed to truly enjoy things. This is a really fine movie and, except for some breaks in editing, does a nice job of presenting the issues in the novel.",

      "reviewBody": "America has always prided itself on its just laws and it&apos;s sense of fairness. However, there are some segments of the country where law and justice, like money, have failed to trickle down into the general public. In some states, the legal system is as harsh and unforgiving as the crime itself. As a consequence, many heartless authorities believe the more brutal a punishment, the more justice is dispense. Indeed, the Southern states, established so sever a retribution on its criminals they became the focus of this accusatory film. The story is taken from the actual exploits of Robert Burns (Paul Muni) who finds himself convicted of the theft of $5.50 and sentenced to ten years Hard Labor. It&apos;s bad enough to be sent to a prison, but he&apos;s also sentenced to dehumanizing, torturous treatment. The bestial and barbaric practices drive him to dare an escape. Using ingenuity and daring, he makes for Chicago where he does well and soon climbs the ladder of success. Years later, he is discovered and threatened with a return. The Governor and many citizens sponsor his safety. However, using an old legal trick, the prison authorities convince Burns to return with a promise of release in a few months. Trusting them he voluntarily returns. However Burns learns he is not to be released as promised. The stripes, the Ball and Chain await him and upon learning of the deception, plots again to escape but the guards are waiting for him to try. A magnificent Black and White film and one which has established itself as a true Classic ****.",

The editing is so rough, that it takes time you grasp the film. At least 8-9 scenes appear in the first 10-minutes, &apos;Saazish&apos; is one of those films that has more-than-needed scenes. However, the final twist is good, but again this film remains as a strictly one-time-watch.\n\nMithun is good. Late actors Raaj Kumar, Vinod Mehra &amp; Amrish Puri are okay. Dimple is wasted, so is Anita Raaj. Raj Babbar does well in a well-written role. Kader Khan does not deliver. His portions look forced by the screenplay.\n\nWatch this film... with zero expectations.",

      "reviewBody": "This was Antonioni’s third film and arguably his rarest from the pre-AVVENTURA period. Taking an episodic structure, it is a sober treatment of juvenile delinquency – showing a widespread alienation affecting the youth of the post-war years in various European cities. The film has a rough, torn-from-the-headlines feel to it – even if the director’s perspective isn’t nearly as acute as in his later, more polished work (tending also towards preachiness, beginning from the opening montage).\n\nThe French episode shows a gang of aimless youth from working-class families cold-bloodedly planning and carrying out the murder of a boastful bourgeois companion of theirs out of envy. The Italian part is more conventional, though featuring some nice noir-ish atmosphere in its tale of a petty smuggler who commits murder in panic, is hurt trying to escape from the police and dies on reaching his home (having in the meantime confessed to his girl). It stars Franco Interlenghi (who appeared in similar ‘denunciations’ by other Italian master film-makers, namely Vittorio De Sica’s SHOESHINE [1946] and Federico Fellini’s I VITELLONI [1953]) and Eduardo Ciannelli, back home after a distinguished Hollywood career as a character actor.\n\nThe English segment – involving the discovery of a body in the park – rather serves as an interesting precursor to the much more celebrated (and abstract) BLOW-UP (1966), It emerges as the best episode, again revolving around a conceited character – only this time it’s he who turns to crime just for kicks (he relishes, even invites all the ensuing publicity). The victim is played by Fay Compton (from Orson Welles’ OTHELLO [1952]), while Patrick Barr (perhaps best-known as the retired blind judge in Pete Walker’s infamous HOUSE OF WHIPCORD [1974]) is the reporter hero.\n\nFor the record, Antonioni was involved with four other feature-film compendiums throughout his career – LOVE IN THE CITY (1953), the little-seen I TRE VOLTI (1965), BEYOND THE CLOUDS (1995) and his swan-song EROS (2004; which I had the privilege of watching during the Venice Film Festival, with the director sitting just a few paces away from me!).",

It&apos;s rushed and dull though...not a good combination. The dramatic mkments are crow-barred in...the moon sequence...the Norwegian space ship. Neither are there to move narrative or charchter forwrd though, and as such feel terribly contrived. And as for this film&apos;s Colonel Kurtz...don&apos;t bother. I kinda wish i hadn&apos;t.",

      "reviewBody": "Ernest Hemingway&apos;s classic short story To Have And Have Not gets yet another remake, an independent production for Seven Arts that stars Audie Murphy taking the place Humphrey Bogart and John Garfield as Hemingway&apos;s iconoclastic fisherman/charter boat skipper.\n\nNo Lauren Bacall like slinky low voiced siren to take our hero&apos;s mind off business. In fact Murphy is happily married to Patricia Owens. But while he has a happy home life he owes some big money around Key West. His boat isn&apos;t even completely paid for and the bank is breathing down his neck. \n\nEddie Albert maybe the answer to his financial prayers. He wants to charter Murphy&apos;s boat for mysterious reasons for a trip to Cuba and remember this is 1958 and the Cuban government is rightly suspicious of strangers without proper clearance going to their island. In fact Albert is a gunrunner looking to sell to revolutionaries at a nice profit.\n\nThe film takes no political sides as to whether it favors the Batista government or the Castro revolutionaries. All you gradually learn along with Murphy is that Albert is one ruthless individual and quite the user. \n\nDirector Don Siegel shot this film on location in Newport Beach, California, curiously enough exactly where Michael Curtiz shot The Breaking Point, John Garfield&apos;s film of this story. Bogart&apos;s was done on the Warner Brothers back lot, none of them got anywhere near Papa Hemingway&apos;s beloved Caribbean waters. Siegel did keep the action going at a good clip.\n\nAudie Murphy showed a bit of versatility here as an actor, taking a break from the B westerns he was doing at Universal. But Eddie Albert who when he does play a villain does remarkably well as he did in The Longest Yard and Attack. One never thinks of him that way, his image is forever fixed with Green Acres, but he was a favorite of mine and his range never ceased to amaze me.\n\nThe Gun Runners is your average B picture film about a controversial political issue in which it takes absolutely no sides.",

And, I guess, the same has to be said for Downey; I watched this, in part, as a sort of &quot;catch up&quot; on his career after seeing Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Nice to see him in his nubile years, and realize that he has accomplished more *with* his personal issues in tow than some of us accomplish while living within conventional bounds of correctness.\n\nAnd... Why does Downey always get these parts where he&apos;s the voice of down-home morality in a sea of squalor? Anyway: Check it out.",

      "reviewBody": "75 years after the release of EROTIKON, I had a chance to see it in a modern cinema in Wroclaw (Poland). The wonderful experience was intensified by the live background music played by the members of Prague Archa theater. It was a lovely return to the end of silent era, the year 1929. The film EROTIKON, made by Gustav Machaty, caused controversy among the audiences of that time. What particularly shocked them was the way the director showed love scenes. Some admired it, some condemned it and, as a result, it was underrated and lost for years. Fortunately, the copy was found in the 1980s and restored for today&apos;s audience who can admire the genius of Machaty.\n\nEROTIKON, like many silent movies, does not offer much action. The content of the movie is, from today&apos;s perspective, quite naive. It is a story of complicated love affairs of George (Olaf Fjord) and his number of women. But, astonishingly, love is not showed as sweetly as in other movies of that time. Some love scenes are, indeed, very open and without taboo (Machaty&apos;s way of showing sex was mostly revealed in EXTASE (1933).\n\nThere are three most memorable moments in this movie: \n\n\n* a love scene between George and Andrea (Ita Rina). It is in no way vulgar but it is directed towards her face in ecstasy for most of the time. That is probably the thing that shocked the audiences.\n\n\n\n* a scene of playing chess. The thrilling atmosphere is really extraordinary. In very few thrillers nowadays will you find an equally well made scene! WONDERFUL!\n\n\n\n* a considerable number of funny slogans throughout the movie. Some are dated but still funny in a way.\n\n\nFor anyone who likes European cinema and for whom film is art in itself, no matter of when it was made, Erotikon is a must to see. It was a great work of the Czech cinema. Partly thanks to this movie, I do believe that silent films may still be highly entertaining. Of course in an entirely different way. They require INTERPRETATION rather than AUTOMATIC WATCHING! Lilian Gish (1893-1993), a famous silent movie star, said once when asked about film art that &quot;silent movies were well on their way to developing into an entirely new art; it was not just pantomime but something wonderfully expressive.&quot; After seeing EROTIKON, one may infer the same.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been watching a lot of these type of horror movies recently - Wrong Turn 2, Hostel 2, Timber Falls etc. All of them feature normal people who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time, and usually end up with some - if not all - of their limbs missing. It&apos;s been a popular horror genre since the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre came out and so it&apos;s difficult to take the premise and make it original. Is &quot;Storm Warning&quot; original? Not really. Is it a good movie? Yes! \n\n&quot;Storm Warning&quot; begins slowly with our two main characters out fishing on their boat. They soon become lost on their way home and end up on a small island as rain clouds fill the sky above. Once they discover a seemingly abandoned house and the storm arrives, all hell then breaks loose. Despite being directed by the same man behind such awful movies as &quot;Valentine&quot;, it&apos;s one of the better horror movies I&apos;ve seen recently (and shows that director Jamie Blanks works best when he doesn&apos;t have to worry about pleasing the censors).\n\n&quot;Storm Warning&quot; manages to combine elements from movies such as &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; to create something that is scary, gory and even funny at times. The three actors who portray the deranged antagonists are all superb and are suitably menacing. You never know quite what they&apos;re going to do next - and it&apos;s that tension that keeps you watching.\n\nIt&apos;s Nadia Fares who really sells this movie though. Her character&apos;s transition throughout &quot;Storm Warning&quot; is totally believable and the way in which her character eventually fights back leads to some brilliant scenes that will both surprise and entertain you. There were at least two occasions where I even found myself thinking &quot;Oh my god! Did that really happen?&quot;\n\nYes, it&apos;s not original but it&apos;s unsettling, well-acted, nicely written, very gory in places and ultimately fun. What more can you ask for from a horror movie? \n\nA triumphant 8 out of 10.",

As with most romantic comedies, it&apos;s nothing deep, had some cheesy moments and was totally predictable (I figured out the whole movie in the first 10 minutes). \n\nBut I really enjoyed it all the same. I laughed a lot in this movie. Partly because I could totally relate to trying to live life under the radar as woman that doesn&apos;t look like a model. Plus it was refreshing to see an African American woman shown with some depth in a movie. Not just the mean black woman.\n\nThere was very little cussing, little sexuality, and no nudity. Truly refreshing these days. \n\nIf you just want to enjoy a movie without having to put too much thought into it, go see this movie.",

There&apos;s hot/sensual scenes. There&apos;s good Special Effects. There&apos;s a fair dose of acting in all that but you cannot say this is a good or extraordinary flick.\n\nThe director tries to rush to the action/sensual or erotic scenes. There&apos;s no cornerstone to substantiate the whole story. You&apos;re led to the basic: Demon exorcism, swearing, erotic moves and decadence in one jovial teenage.\n\nI can say: Give it a try.",

      "reviewBody": "Ed Harley lives with his young son in the country, where they live a simple life and run a small store. Some city teens stop by at the store and get on their bikes for some fun. While this is happening Ed leaves his son to look after the shop as he delivers a item to a customer. When Ed arrives back he finds out his boy has been accidentally killed by one the careless riders. In fist of anger he seeks out an old lady who can summon up a demon which shall exact revenge on those involved in the death of his son. However, Ed starts to realise it was a bad idea and he eventually finds out that conjuring up this demon comes at a price. \n\nOh hail, B-legend Lance Henriksen! It&apos;s Henriksen&apos;s burning conviction and special effects whiz Stan Winston&apos;s masterful monster design that lifts this B-grade monster feature out of the very ordinary mould. I can see why those factors get highly praised. Pretty much it&apos;s typical 80s horror fodder, but on that point I found this minor piece be an enthralling backwoods shocker that&apos;s effectively creepy and ominous in its set-up. The atmospheric air just has that feel of the old style monster flicks. I found it to be a vivid treasure in that department with the empty woodlands being so chillingly, foreboding in presence. The dread of it all just swallows you up! Especially the glum conclusion. The night scenes are sensationally staged with very classy touches with the moon&apos;s rays shinning through, swirling mists and the shades of blues flood the screen with great impact. Director Stan Winston (making his debut) utilizes the scenery with skillful execution by giving the film such an organic feel and producing some blinding images within some eerie and thrilling set-pieces (the transformation scene being one). Chiming in also is that of the score which creaks an unsteady terror with it&apos;s alienating chords. I thought the dark feel and slick look of the film is perfect and that&apos;s rightfully so. \n\nThough, it&apos;s not without its flaws. The main one being the scratchy writing with it being riddled with clichés, loose characters and repetition. The premise and feeble script could have done with a polish up, because the urban legend of this rural demon does make for an interesting viewing. Thrown up in the story are some thoughtful questions and a emotional edge, but still it was kinda lacking. The stock characters are reasonably an unlikeable bunch, but thank goodness Lance Henriksen gives out a powerful and hypnotic performance that you totally feel his hurt. While, the rest of the cast were modest even if their characters are vague as can be and had very little to work with. Now the other star of the film was the magnificent, but horrific looking demon that&apos;s simply grand in stature and hands out punishment with such ease by toying around with it&apos;s victims in such a cruel manner. Death scenes might be brutal, but if you want some gore out of those moments there is some bad news. There ain&apos;t any. Some blood, but no gore. But if you&apos;re looking for some suspense leading up to the kills it seems to mishandle those moments by being very foreseeable. Pacing wise the film is solid even though after the intense beginning it seems to stall for a while, well that&apos;s until Pumpkinhead reappears and things really do get going with it&apos;s quest for relentless horror. \n\nA solid and creative effort overall that relishes from it&apos;s visually brooding direction, superior lead performance and convincing monster design.",

If you don&apos;t dig the story, you will not deny the songs =) I was a youngster in 74, but I still liked it then, not even knowing what it meant to be in that state.

      "reviewBody": "There are quite different opinions on Bohdan Slama, a young Czech director. I give my own here. I believe him to be the greatest talent of the current Czech cinematography. He worked on his second movie &quot;Stesti&quot; really hard and for a long time, which eventually led to a surprisingly good result and high expectations of his upcoming work. He is marvelous (and precise!) in directing the actors, he gives them life and credibility. The movie is very dense and every moment is functional so it requires you to watch carefully! Most people say it is a sad or even a drastic movie and take the name Stesti rather as irony of the author. &quot;Stesti&quot; is ambiguous between happiness and luck. The German Glück is exactly the same. (How silly that they try to find different names for it in English and German! Something like happiness is a REALLY bad translation.) Seeing the movie only from its sad side is seeing the surface. Somewhere deeper, in the minds of the two main characters - Tonik and Monika, who eventually fall in love, there is a real happiness, one which most of us hasn&apos;t had the opportunity to experience. The happiness stems from the very fact that they live a life which is not simple but very meaningful. The sad and drastic background stands in direct contrast to the inner happiness of the characters. This is most apparent at the very end, where Monika, after leaving her boyfriend in the United States (most obviously standing for empty meaningless material dreams, not at all for a better life) comes back to Tonik&apos;s house (the symbol of all his humble material efforts but also and mainly his home), which is under destruction. Monika leaves the place with a light smile (how can people not see that!) and goes looking for Tonik, the source of her happiness, the one who gives her life meaning, no matter where he is, whether he has a house, or fixes broken windows with a piece of scotch-tape. The message of the movie is totally universal and labeling it as a social drama stemming from the unsatisfactory situation of an industrial and poor region of the Czech Republic is a misinterpretation, or at least a demotion.",

      "reviewBody": "I just want to start off saying I adore the story A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, it is timeless and alongside The Nutcracker it is for me the quintessential Christmas story. There are some good, great even, versions of this classic, the Alastair Sim film(up there with It&apos;s a Wonderful Life) as the ultimate Christmas film, the George C. Scott film and Muppet Christmas Carol.\n\nI wish I could add this film to the list of great versions, but sadly, I can&apos;t. For me, this is the worst version. However, it is not a complete embarrassment. Simon Callow is good as Charles Dickens and as Ebeneezer Scrooge, and the live-action opening scene is one of two good scenes the other being the Ghost of Christmas Yet-to-Come sequence, Kate Winslet is charming and touching as Belle and of the soundtrack(which I quite liked) What If and the Charlotte Church song are the standouts.\n\nI really wanted to like it, but I did wish Christmas Carol:The Movie- the ghastly, uninspired title alone is just one of the problems- wasn&apos;t so lifeless and dull. Two things especially made it so. One was the quality of the animation, the look of the film does look drab with flat colours, with the background art lacking fluidity and the character designs looking quite dated. The other is the storytelling despite the core of the story being there, the fact that there were changes didn&apos;t bother me actually, it&apos;s just that some especially the anthropomorphic mice were unnecessary, overly cute and interrupted the flow of the story far too much. The romantic subplot took too long to get going too, and the Walking in the air-like sequences are some of the film&apos;s better scenes visually but they too drag the story down to a lesser extent.\n\nWhile there is the odd dialogue lifted from the book, most of it feels dumbed down and juvenile as if to appeal more to children or those who haven&apos;t read the story, which is what I felt similarly about most of the subplots. The voice cast Callow and Winslet aside are disappointing. They are talented but their dialogue is lacking. Jane Horrocks and Michael Gambon are fine actors and do fit into their roles well enough, it&apos;s just that the writing and storytelling disallows them into doing anything particularly special with them. The worst by far is Nicolas Cage, who doesn&apos;t work at all as Jacob Marley sounding very bored and monotone throughout.\n\nIn conclusion, two or three good things aren&apos;t enough to save this film. 3/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "He lost his heart in Heidelberg - enchanting classic with Christian Wolff and Sabine Sinjen\n\nWith the premiere in the Berlin Theater in 1901, Wilhelm Meyer-Förster achieved a true stroke of genius. His piece &quot;Alt Heidelberg&quot; became a global success. Numerous film adaptations were to follow. Ramon Novarro and Norma Shearer, directed by Ernst Lubitsch (1927), and Edmund Purdom and Ann Blyth for MGM (1954) could also be seen as an unlikely dream couple in beautiful Heidelberg.\n\nThe present version was produced by Artur Brauner and directed by Ernst Marischka, who was nominated for the ACADEMY AWARD for his original screenplay for &quot;Polonaise&quot; (1946) with Cornel Wilde.\n\nThe fantastic Christian Wolff (*1938) plays Prince Karl Heinrich of Saxe-Karlsburg, who is granted at least a year of study in Heidelberg before his state obligations. There he enjoys student life with good friends (great: Harry Meyen (1924-1979) as Count Detlev von Asterberg) and experiences his first love in the form of the enchanting innkeeper&apos;s niece Käthi (wonderful: Sabine Sinjen (1942-1995)).\n\nKitsch as kitsch can! But beautiful and wonderfully nostalgic! Christian Wolff achieved amazing things in those years. As young as he was, he made some films during this time that were worthy of rediscovery, but unfortunately they were all too quickly forgotten. Particularly recommended are &quot;The Blue Moth&quot; and &quot;Crimes After School&quot;. In this film, Wolff even sings: &quot;You, you are close to my heart.&quot; Other roles include Gert Fröbe (1913-1988, whom Christian Wolff would meet again in &quot;Via Mala&quot;) as an understanding tutor, Rudolf Vogel as a stern valet and Siegfried Schürenberg as a minister of state. And the very young Hannelore Elsner (1942-2019) can be seen as the serving girl Helene.\n\nA nostalgic fun! Wonderful!",

      "reviewBody": "The following review is an extract from the book &quot;Santo, the Wrestler with the Silver Mask: A guide to all his films&quot;, which is now available on Amazon.\n\n&quot;Dr. Hugo Olvritch, aka Achilles, is a mad scientist with the intention of subjugating the world. The great powers are worried after two strange events: The launch of a rocket and the explosion of a hydrogen bomb on an island. The US, the USSR and other powerful states deny having anything to do with it. International representatives are meeting in a security council with the intention of preventing the outbreak of World War III.\n\n(...)\n\nOn this occasion, the Saint plays a role as an international secret agent, in a film that combines the intrigue of the spy genre with science fiction.\n\nAt the beginning there is a very long prologue, reminiscent of the one in &quot;Who Can Kill a Child?&quot; (Narciso Ibáñez Serrador, 1977), where a voice-over narrator warns of the dire consequences of the wars, violence and conflicts that have wounded mankind since the beginning of time. The prologue becomes even longer, and numerous inserts, archive scenes about rocket launches, nuclear bomb detonations, etc., are paraded before our eyes.\n\nSanto, the supposed protagonist, takes 20 minutes to appear. He does so in a ring fight against Blue Demon. He must then collaborate with Professor Gerard (and the &quot;world security control&quot;) in locating Olvritch&apos;s hideout and neutralizing him.\n\nThe film was directed by Julián Soler, a director who is extremely interesting for having made two memorable films: &quot;Si usted no puede, yo sí&quot; (1951), a comedy with a script by Luis Buñuel and Luis Alcoriza; and the excellent &quot;Pánico&quot; (1966), a psychological horror triptych (not exempt from black humor in its last segment). On the other hand, this &quot;Santo contra Blue Demon en la Atántida&quot; is predictable and dispensable.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "I actually found this to be a decent movie. Yeah it suffered from some silliness and goofy stuff like the scene where they space walk to repair their ship and their tool of choice? A wrench, ha!! However, from the point where the astronaut landed on the asteroid it was pretty good. The story was well written for the most part and the acting wasn&apos;t that bad. The girls were really cute and if i had landed there, id probably stay and enjoy myself!!! This truly played much like an episode from star trek, with another actor subbing for captain kirk. Some of the special effects on the asteroid were pretty decent, especially when the main character shrank in his space suit. The bad alien crashing rocks into his invisible prison out of frustration was pretty cool too, but the alien itself was kinda stupid looking. There were some genuinely touching scenes: the astronaut saying the Lord&apos;s Prayer while he floated helplessly doomed in space, and the final goodbyes there at the end. This was released in 1961 so maybe that explains why its a notch or two better than the typical fifties stuff. I actually enjoyed this one. I&apos;m sure audiences in 1961 weren&apos;t let down. Heck they might have caught this one and The Three Stooges Meet Hercules at a drive in double feature. Cool!!!!",

Williams was at his quick witted best and the entire cast just seemed to fit the film. Granted, this is a &quot;roll with the comedy&quot; kind of film. There may be a little bit too much &quot;potty&quot; humor, but it isn&apos;t anything raunchy like Wedding Crashers or other films aimed at teens. This is good for the entire family and will have them all laughing.\n\nSome of the plot and a few of the jokes are telegraphed from a mile away but the strength of the performances and a troop of likable characters transform it from a film you merely wouldn&apos;t regret watching to one you&apos;ll actually enjoy.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "The first of what became Pier Poalo Pasolini&apos;s Trilogy of Life, with each film adapting stories from archaic literature. In this case, Giovanni Boccaccio&apos;s book of the same name, written in 14th century Italy. The film takes nine of the 100 stories from the book and weaves them into vignettes of everyday Medieval life. We see nymphomaniac nuns, grave robbing, deceit, and cuckolding. In one segment, a boy is lured into the house of a pretty girl. She tells him that he is her brother. however, after taking his clothes and money, the boy is thrown out, where he is picked up by a couple of thieves who recruit him to climb inside of a tomb and steal the recently dead archbishop&apos;s ruby ring. The boy is left trapped in the grave.\n\nThis bawdy romp is a lot of fun. This was a surprise being Pasolini. The portmanteau style storytelling works well with this roaming tour through a debauched, ancient landscape. Many of the oddball characters were non- actors (something Pasolini had used throughout his career), and some have such incredibly rickety teeth, and are a strange and uncomfortable, yet thoroughly enjoyable watch.\n\nThe film ends with a statement by Pasolini himself (he played the painter, Giotto between, and within some of the stories), which is possibly a statement about the dream like quality the narrative has in its assemblage of the parts. He says: Why create a work of art, when you can just dream about it? Indeed, why create narrative cinema, when you can manoeuvre through scenes of life and create a patchwork of living, permeated with verisimilitude.\n\nwww.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

That makes its let down even more pronounced. \n\nSo overall, I give it an 8/10 because you can&apos;t overlook the drop in quality of the second half. \n\n8/10",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s not quite as sweet as &apos;Lassie&apos; or as visually stunning as &apos;E.T.&apos; but Dragonworld is an overall pleasant story. It is a bit too short, and slightly dated, but there is probably enough charm and magic for a young audience that has not been lobotomized by modern entertainment, cartoons, crude humor, action figures and all that jazz.\n\nAfter his the death of his parents, young John McGowen moves to Scotland to live with his uncle in the family castle. One lonely afternoon he wishes for a friend, and five minutes later he finds a baby dragon. We jump ahead twenty years, and John now lives alone in the McGowan castle with his dragon buddy, and nobody disturbs them, until a crooked business man finds out about the dragon and tricks John into selling him to his theme park. At first, John is relieved because he needs the money to pay off back taxes, but soon he finds out that his dragon is mistreated, and with the help of his new girlfriend and her father, they try to break him out. Happy ending.\n\nThe dragon is a mix of three different effects, and only one of them works. There is a stop motion miniature, a cg dragon which flies, and a full size animatronic head and neck which breathes fire. Only the animatronics are competent.\n\nI think the appropriate age range for this movie would be around seven to twelve. Adults can enjoy this too, but not as much. Dragonworld is likable, but not lovable.",

With a plot that struggles to find its footing and moments that veer into unintentional hilarity, it&apos;s hard to take &quot;T T Syndrome&quot; seriously. Ultimately, it&apos;s a disappointing experience that leaves viewers questioning why they invested their time in it. With its poor execution and lack of redeeming qualities, it&apos;s a wonder it garners a rating of 6/10 on IMDB. Save yourself the trouble and steer clear of this cinematic misfire.",

      "reviewBody": "If looks could kill, then Meiko Kaji would win hands down.  The Toei Series Joshu Sasori (aka Female Convict Scorpion) is based on a 70&apos;s comic series which ran in the Japanese Adult Manga Magazine Big Comics. Joshu Sasori Dai 41 Zakkyobou (Female Convict Scorpion-Jailhouse 41) is the second movie of the series (Kaji would star in two additional sequels).  Matsu (Meiko Kaji) is the Scorpion of the title and is the near silent heroine of the movie. In classic Japanese exploitation fashion she is subjected to all sorts of cruelty and punishment at the hands of a sadistic prison warden and his equally sinister underlings.  Matsu as we learn in narration was wrongly imprisoned and must fight to survive and escape imprisonment. During the course of the movie She joins a gang of other female convicts and escapes from prison.  The gang creates all sorts of violent mayhem with Matsu silently watching on.  Very bloody, grim and violent, Jailhouse 41 is atypical of the violent, sexploitation movies Toei released during the &apos;70s. Directory Shunya Ito presents the movie in a surreal narrative that is both haunting and inventive.  Kaji is captivating as the heroine although her character allows little for her to develop.  For those who are fans of girls-in-prison movies this may be your cup of tea.  On the other hand for those who are wanting more story and character development you might be better served to avoid this."

Caught in the throes of mystery and intrigue, her father, Morten, finds himself ensnared in a labyrinth of secrets that threaten to consume him.\n\nDirectors Mathieu Petuel and César Ducasse exhibit a deft hand in the genre, utilizing a deliberate pace to gradually intensify the tension. Unlike conventional American slashers, &quot;Dark Souls&quot; eschews gratuitous jump scares in favor of a more psychological approach, interspersed with moments of visceral horror.\n\nWhile the thematic use of oil adds a layer of complexity, it&apos;s the grotesque body horror that truly leaves an indelible impression. With subtle nods to horror classics and standout performances, particularly from Morten Ruda, the film strikes a delicate balance between unease and macabre humor.\n\nFor an immersive cinematic experience, &quot;Dark Souls&quot; demands to be witnessed on the grand scale, where its evocative imagery can truly envelop and unsettle audiences, ensuring an unforgettable journey into the heart of darkness.",

So we do see the mother Elling here (and we know something about her if we have seen the other movie). Now there is also another Elling movie that I reckon is a sequel to the other one ... which would make it a double sequel to this one? Does sound weird? Well that is what you are getting with these films, so buckle up and get ready for craziness in a fun way.\n\nWell fun way for some, not so fun for others I reckon. It is never easy to tell another person that they will find something funny and/or hillarious ... unless you know the type of humor that person does like. So if you&apos;ve seen the first one and liked it ... well it is more than fair to say you will like this too. I felt it lacked a bit in comparison to the first one ... but it still is a good and funny comedy, that touches all the right (quirky) notes ...",

      "reviewBody": "(***1/2 out of *****)\n\nThis shot-in-Minnesota Argento mystery-thriller never gets the credit it deserves.  So it&apos;s not as flashy and deliriously twisted as some of the Italian master&apos;s earlier work -- so what.  It relies more on creating people you actually care about and, for this reason, I think it&apos;s one of his most character-driven films.  Argento&apos;s real-life daughter (and European sex symbol) Asia Argento plays a young anorexic who witnesses the decapitation murder of her parents by a serial killer known as `The Head Hunter&apos; who only kills when it&apos;s raining.  With the help of a local TV news writer (Christopher Rydell), who is himself a recovering drug addict, she tries to solve the murders and reveal the killer&apos;s identity before he/she kills again.  Although it&apos;s not quite as lavish as, say, Suspiria or Opera, there are some typically inventive touches that raise this above other early-90s slasher movies of its kind (for example, the killer uses a mechanical device with a razor-sharp wire to decapitate victims, and some heads continue to move and even speak for a few seconds after they&apos;ve been cut off.)  A great oddball cast (including eccentric character actor Brad Dourif, Frederic Forrest as the suspicious, unconventional doc, and Piper Laurie as Asia&apos;s batty, phony-medium mom) make it even more enjoyable -- but, honestly, this movie has one of the most unusual and seemingly out-of-place opening and closing credits sequences of any movie I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\nHIGHLIGHT:  When the wire on the decapitation device snags on Dourif&apos;s necklace, the unruffled killer compensates by dragging him over to an elevator shaft and pushing his head under the descending elevator car."

      "reviewBody": "England&apos;s Hammer Studios did 9 Dracula or vampire films from 1958-1974:\n\n1. Horror of Dracula (1958); 2. Brides of Dracula (1960); 3. Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966); 4. Dracula has Risen from the Grave (1968); 5. Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970); 6. Scars of Dracula (1970); 7. Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972); 8. The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973); and 9. The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974).\n\nChristopher Lee plays the Count in all but &quot;The Brides of Dracula&quot; and &quot;The Legend 7 Golden Vampires.&quot; Peter Cushing also stars in four entries as Van Helsing.\n\nBy the time of the seventh film the creative well was apparently running dry and Hammer decided to spice up the series by bringing the Count to present-day London (1972, of course), which was Hammer&apos;s response to other successful vampire films at the time taking place in the modern day, such as &quot;The Night Stalker,&quot; &quot;Blacula&quot; and &quot;Count Yorga.&quot; The story revolves around a group of hip counter-culture youths performing a black mass in an abandoned church for kicks (although the ringleader takes it serious) and they revive the blood-sucking prince of darkness. Havok ensues.\n\nPeter Cushing appears as Van Helsing&apos;s descendant. Christopher Neame plays the nutjob who performs the black mass with utter relish. Also on hand are the stunning beauties Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro. Stephanie plays Van Helsing&apos;s daughter and Caroline has a small but significant role. There are a couple of other early-70s hippie babes as well.\n\nThe first half of the film borrows heavily from the previous &quot;Taste the Blood of Dracula&quot; in that the Count is resurrected in roughly the same manner, although &quot;Taste&quot; is more effective. Which isn&apos;t to say that &quot;Dracula A.D. 1972&quot; isn&apos;t a decent entry in the series, albeit bizarre. The main problem with the film is that the story doesn&apos;t seem to know what to do once Dracula is resurrected. For instance, Cushing&apos;s final battle with the Count is fairly lame for various reasons (I don&apos;t want to give anything away), not to mention Lee only appears for about 10 minute in the entire film, which is usual for the series, of course.\n\nAnother problem is the score. It screams &quot;early 70s&quot; in a bad way, but doesn&apos;t mesh with what is essentially a serious horror flick. Of course some would cite that as part of its charm. I said &quot;serious horror flick, by the way, because this is not a goofy or campy flick despite the colorful hippie elements and lousy score.\n\nWhat works best is that it&apos;s a great period piece. You&apos;ll get a groovy glimpse of England&apos;s counter-culture, including the hippie girls and a live performance by the band Stoneground (who didn&apos;t go anywhere beyond this movie, likely because their sound &amp; style was already passe by 1972). So, the first half is fun and compelling, whereas the second half just sort of goes through the motions and peters out.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: &quot;Dracula A.D. 1972&quot; is hard to rate because, despite the mediocre-ness of the story&apos;s second half, the film is a fun experience with numerous highlights. Hence, as a Dracula story I give it a C+, but for entertainment value I give it a solid B or B+.\n\nThe film runs 96 minutes and was shot in England.\n\nGRADE: B-",

      "reviewBody": "My main issue with the film is it could&apos;ve been better, there were some interesting ideas presented rather than just rehashing the original in a dulled down way as most sequels do, the cast were great although writing-wise the character development from the first film had basically vanished and the new characters were somewhat forgettable, still some funny moments but not as memorable as the original, similarly the songs were not as memorable as the original either, lots of abandoned plot threads and characters that had no role in the story but were just kind of there, it feels unfair to compare this to the original since that was over 14 years ago, time flies, but I just think there wasn&apos;t really a reason to make a sequel to the first Enchanted\n\nEven so, as far as sequels go it&apos;s not the worst, the aforementioned positives stood out for me, the sets were beautiful and costume design was excellent, and I liked some of the ideas the sequel was leading into but the execution just fell flat for me, felt very rushed, sense of scale gone, the animated sequences were almost unnecessary this time as they didn&apos;t even involve much movement or expression, and it&apos;s a scathing indictment of both Disney&apos;s gradual attempts to abandon animation as a medium (despite it being so crucial to their past success) and the conditions animators have to work under, with very little pay or suitable hours, especially compared with the animated sequences of the first film.\n\nAll in all it ironically kinda lives up to the Disney tradition of making a memorable, iconic blockbuster film about a princess and then having the direct-to-video sequel being kind of underwhelming, I&apos;d rate this a 6 or a 5 under other circumstances but because I feel like it was close to being a better film and just didn&apos;t reach that, and because it doesn&apos;t live up to the original, I think 4 is kind of appropriate, Disney needs to pick up their slack, they&apos;re becoming too complacent.",

Thanks Goodness for Christina Millian in Bring It On 5 or this whole B.I.O series would have died long time ago. What to say about B.I.O 4: all the actors sucks, especially the blondes. The cheer-dances are like nothing compared to the dances in the others B.I.O movies. The script is awful and the acting is even worst. There is absolutely no face to remember in this movie, not even the main character. Do you remember Hayden Panetierre in B.I.O 3? Or that HOT afro-American babe in B.I.O. 2(sorry, i don&apos;t remember her name)? Or even Kristen Dunst in the first B.I.O movie? I surely do. But this B.I.O 4 is like a complete void to me. I just finished watching it like just 5 minutes ago and i already forgot everything and everybody in it. Don&apos;t waste your time and money on this one, &apos;cause even if you do, you&apos;ll forget it all in less than 5 min. Guaranteed."

      "reviewBody": "I truly feel that this film is an unsung masterpiece. From the opening credits to the Don&apos;s last cry of &quot;Susana,&quot; it&apos;s a captivating, mysterious, and rich work. It is an epic both dark and profound, exploring a range of human motivations and emotions.\n\nThis film, based on the short novel of the same title, opens the flood-gates for the &quot;magical realism&quot; that would afterward fill the Latino arts. I cannot emphasize how well done the mysticism is. This is by no means a &quot;ghost movie,&quot; but it&apos;s not afraid to use them. One scene in particular is so haunting and powerful it made me absolutely giddy. Our protagonist&apos;s visits to various residents of the run-down village are some of my favorite bits of cinema.\n\nPotential &quot;Spoilers&quot; Begin Here: \n\nI felt a common chord in the Don&apos;s obsession with Susana and C.F. Kane&apos;s nostalgia with &quot;Rosebud&quot; in &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; Both men become so consumed with ambition that they can no longer possess their ideal. Both men long for something so fundamental and simple that they smother it in their quest. Perhaps it is because this ideal *cannot* be possessed. The themes of possession with Susana are clear. She thinks of herself as belonging to Florencio, her father thinks he owns her as both daughter and lover, and of course Pedro Páramo thinks of himself as owner. But can a person own another? Can a man own the careless joys of his childhood? \n\nIn Páramo&apos;s yearning for the unattainable, he populates and destroys an entire region. And so resonates one of the last lines of the film: &quot;Todos somos hijos de Pedro Páramo!&quot; (&quot;All of us are the children of Pedro Páramo!&quot;) But aren&apos;t we? Aren&apos;t we all the offspring of misled ambition--genetically, nationally, culturally, ethically, or religiously? There is a Pedro Páramo looming somewhere in our origins.\n\nI applaud this film.",

This movie was really hard to find until recently (just came out on blu-ray April 2012) so years ago I found an old paperback of the Jack Finney novel and read it. Loved the story. Then, finally, I was able to see the movie ... disappointing. My biggest complaint is the direction: absolutely flaccid, dull and without any creativity. Not surprisingly the director, Jack Donohue, was a hack TV director almost his entire career and only directed a handful of movies - none of them good. And so Assault on a Queen feels soooo slow when it really should be fast paced and have high energy. The great Rod Serling wrote the script from a fun novel, so I&apos;m not going to blame the writing. And the acting was fine too. The only other problem was the music: poorly used and sparse and never seemed appropriate for the scene. I suppose I can blame the director for this too since he&apos;d be the one overseeing where it was used.\n\nAnyway, worth watching for fans of 60s heist movies. I like it, but wish it were better.",

The local residents and hunting lodge members there are involved in a big campaign to help the wild animals from the reserve to survive the winter. The same night Miron and Melita arrive, a boy named Halasz is found half-frozen at the edge of the swamp where, he raves, that he was attacked by a white ghost on one of the islands of the swamp. From then on, he can no longer talk. The old woman Etelka reveals the secret that the ghost had been first seen long ago and that you cannot go to the island because the ghost wreaks vengeance on anyone stepping onto the island. Fear takes hold in the place. The hunters, with Vucevic, Kovacevic and Levay taking the lead, begin an investigation however neither they nor the doctors can help Halasz.

Also missing here is Marlon Brando&apos;s larger than life Don Corleone; none of the actor&apos;s here can come close.\n\nThe violence becomes repetitive as do the betrayals which bored me, and the editing seemed haphazard, never developing a coherent flow. The overall production is competent with decent acting but in the end I didn&apos;t care what happened to anyone from the chairman down the the many Yakuza soldiers. Everyone is corrupt, including the police, taking bribes to the street criminals looking out for themselves.",

So instead of getting big-time Hollywood funding the movie&apos;s producers have to bamboozle Canadian dentists into chipping in as a tax dodge. You end up with a cheaply made movie that wouldn&apos;t see the inside of a movie theatre without a terrorist threat, and probably got shown on late-night CBC at least once a year for decades.

Basically a live action, feel-good version of the Prince of Egypt cartoon, trading Egyptians and Hebrews for nomadic Muslims. But that being said, it was decent and crisp.\n\nFilming locations seemed really great, like LOTR - The Two Towers without any need for CGI! As for rating/violence, it could have almost been PG13 in the US, but I liked this fact. It was a clean-ish film that likens back to the spaghetti western. No over-the-top violence, sex, swearing, or embellishing for the sake of a Hollywood audience. While this generally comes off slightly cartoonish, it was refreshing.\n\nAs for the language, I would swear that it seemed to be filmed in English and dubbed in Kazakh. In fact, I don&apos;t usually mind a dubbed movie (especially Spanish or Japanese for some reason), but half-way through this film, I realized there was an English audio track and switched it over, and I was more engaged.\n\nThe horse work was pretty amazing, I thought.\n\nAgain, overall, this film seemed to have all the filming quality of an expensive Hollywood movie, but brought a niceness that&apos;s less common in contemporary film (Note: guaranteed NOT to hold the attention of most American youth).",

      "reviewBody": "Southbound is unlike most Horror films, belonging to a sub-genre I would define as &quot;intertwined&quot;. 5 different stories leading to and deriving from each other: Two friends on trying to get home, a girl band trying to get to their next gig, a man trying to go home to his loving wife, a brother trying to rescue his sister, and a family on vacation before their daughter goes to college. Sufficing to say nothing ends well.\n\nThe common ground for the tales is the actual ground, as they all seem to be taking place at the same location, referred to as &quot;the middle of nowhere&quot; and giving a strong sensation of Hell itself. Also, all the characters seem to be tuned in to the same radio station, where the DJ hints of his awareness to their sins and struggles. In each story, the protagonists (if you can call them that) have secrets in an escalating level of severity, and I guess the moral is that Karma always catches up to you.\n\nSeeing as how each story is around 17 minutes in average, it&apos;s quite challenging for me to rate the film as a whole. The screen writing is by far the best feature, as the stories leave you confused, wondering, desperate and lost. Some fine shooting and cinematography as well, especially during the beginning of The Accident part (great work from directors and screenwriters Roxanne Benjamin, David Bruckner and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin). The acting is also good, but the each of the cast is given little screen time, so it&apos;s hard to say anything more. I will say that all the cast is largely unknown, and still showed a lot of promise.\n\nAll in all, Southbound would appeal to fans of more &quot;artistic&quot; Horror films. It&apos;s unusual and quite unique, leaving the audience with an uneasy sense of bewilderment. While not my preferable sub- genre, I was very impressed with it and enjoyed it to the last second.",

As for the action, there isn&apos;t even one minute of genuine danger or suspense. If the villain, played by Pat Morita(!) wasn&apos;t so show-offy, there wouldn&apos;t have been a movie, either.

The Genetic Opera. Somehow the movie reminds me a little of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and that&apos;s for sure not the worst reference.\n\nWell, the genetic opera is filled with fine ideas, gore, slash and some good songs. It is an explosion of blood compared with all the blood- and lifeless productions which flood the screens of cinema and all the networks nowadays.\n\nIf you like musicals and gore, this is made for loving you - and don&apos;t forget to watch The Devil&apos;s Carnival, also directed by Darren Lynn Bousman: a horror musical.",

If you turn on the movie not expecting any kind of masterpiece (or not expecting much at all), you won&apos;t be a bit disappointed. I could predict much if not most of what was going to happen.\n\nWhat I found most fascinating about this movie is that it was filmed in Bulgaria. I never would have guessed that that country looks so much like the Pacific Northwest (the setting seriously did look like Washington and Oregon).\n\nBut mostly, this is the sort of movie that you rent if there&apos;s nothing else to watch.

However after giving it a shot, I did notice some amazing similarities and some good differences. Differences I guess that epitomised a Lassie film back then.\n\nI know the 60&apos;s movie Greyfriar&apos;s Bobby very well, so I did chuckle at many references that was &apos;inspired or duplicated&apos;.\n\nAnd having Donald Crisp have a role in the movie, then 11 years later appear in effectively the same movie, in a different role tied both the movies well. But to me Greyfriar&apos;s Bobby, the TRUE dog, will always be better than Lassie.\n\nLassie or Bobby.. it doesn&apos;t really matter. The story is absolutely compelling from start to finish.",

      "reviewBody": "When his colleague is killed in a car crash, worn out journalist Steve Everett inherits her story  a human interest piece on a man due to be executed at midnight that night.  Everett tries to balance his collapsing personal life with his feeling that the condemned man, Beachum, is innocent. He begins to search for the vital evidence that will prove his feeling correct.\n\nThis sounds like you know where it&apos;s going  a worn out journalist (alcoholic), an innocent man on death row, an investigation etc etc.but for the majority this manages to avoid all the usual pitfalls.  It does this by being very well written, instead of caricatures we have characters.  Everett is a mess, and Eastwood lets us see this  we&apos;re used to seeing rogue cops and journalists sleeping around, drinking etc, but here we see the consequences of this.  Likewise we are made to feel for the Beachum family and get a feel for the human stories that exist in the support characters. However, with 30 minutes to go, we have the usual twist and countdown thriller conclusion that spoils it a lot, but not completely.\n\nEastwood is excellent as a director, but he&apos;s even better here as a actor. At times he plays it too light, but for the majority we can see him weighted down by the pressure of his quest but also the self inflicted collapse of his personal life.  This is not an ego-driven project.  Washington however steals the show with a great performance, you can&apos;t help be moved by his dignity  Denzel is not the only Washington who is under-rewarded.  Lisa Gay Hamilton is also superb and works really well with Washington  together they take some scenes that could have been soapy or melodramatic and make them powerful and emotional.  Woods is good and has good banter with Eastwood, but a times feels out of place with the mood of the film  but he does provide some humour.  Leary is great in a non-comedy role, he is the representation of Everett&apos;s selfishness.  Diane Venora is OK in a small role as Everett&apos;s wife (the casting director had clearly seen her similar role in Heat).  And we have small roles for McKean and a strange role from Lucy Liu  very small considering she had already done a few big movies.\n\nWe get some `jobs for the boys&apos; but they don&apos;t affect the quality  Eastwood has his wife (at time of writing!) Dina Eastwood and his daughter Francesca in side roles.\n\nOverall, it may fall into the usual crime thriller cliché of a big twist, but up till then it is an assured character driven piece that is very enjoyable to watch."

One of the better facets here is the film&apos;s rather nice setup offering a lot of details that are brought together here. With the overall discovery of the demonic incantations being applied by the staff and students at the facility, the connection with the family backstory involving his missing sister and the fateful accident with his parents, and the interconnected tales within everything here, it all serves well enough here to generate a highly enjoyable setup that has a lot to like. Making the least likely person the head of the whole apocalyptic plan was a bit of a stretch to believe thinking about afterward, but it keeps the viewer hooked into thinking anything can happen as there&apos;s a lot of mystery wrung out of this that captivates what little attention that could have been given, and the storyline is pretty clever. The other effect aspect of this one is the rather effective atmosphere that comes about due to the fine apocalyptic setup. The overall mixture of sorcery and black magic, especially with the rituals being prepared here for the final ceremony, combines with the location being a great setting for some Gothic atmosphere. This comes about with its darkened hallways, eerie cemetery, and expansive rooms within to make for some decent moments at times when this one really gets its solid plot going as there&apos;s some general creepiness on display here. That&apos;s all given an emphatic boost with the graphic demon attacks involving the being viciously ripping people&apos;s hearts out that delivers some solid low-budget blood splatter for gore to help overcome the lack of other real effects here. With a fine Gothic-tinged finale also coming into play here, the film does manage to have some generally appealing factors going for it. That said, there&apos;s still plenty to dislike here. The main stumbling block is from the exceptionally short running time that barely gives this one an hour-long running time, with a rather inane amount of time spent on flashbacks that aren&apos;t that exciting or thrilling and never seem capable of giving the film any energy as it meanders on from one scene to the next. There is also no suspense whatsoever involving a rather unimposing supernatural killer that doesn&apos;t evoke fear at all. There were plenty of opportunities to provide some cheap thrills and instead relies on having some supposedly scary demon with glowing eyes popping up sometimes to kill people for a sacrificial ritual to give off scares. He never did, and his power simply sticking his hand inside your body and pulling out your heart in one piece was entirely laughable. When added to this one&apos;s low-budget gloss, comes up rather lacking in the end.\n\nRated R: Violence and Language.",

A gentle spoof of all of those Fu Manchu films over the years,(and frankly better than many of them) It contained many of the hallmarks of Sellers films such as playing multiple roles (Fu Manchu and nemesis Nayland Smith) Using comic actors of similar stripe (Sid Caesar) re-uniting with Bert Kwouk (his man-servant in many of the Pink Panther movies.) This was also the farewell film of actor David Tomlinson and John Le Messeur both of whom retired from films after this. The movie is a fun romp with a mix of the absurd slapstick and the witty dialog of the characters. One of my favorite lines happens after a line of dacoit assassins appear in front of Fu Manchu and he says &quot;you can&apos;t fool me with a cheap cinematic trick.&quot; This was very fitting farewell to a great comic genius.",

It is helmed by a strong cast of principle performers and carried off by a unique twist on the sequel impetus.  The idea is fairly original, as opposed to the usual: for this story, one would normally expect they&apos;d just focus on another group of survivors and how they get out.  Instead of dealing with people wanting to get out, the plot is spurred on by people wanting to get IN.  Then, ironically, they become trapped and become the people who have to get out, along with some of those aforementioned survivors to keep with tradition.  I also have to give the film credit for that little bits of continuity, like Linda&apos;s body is still lying near the entrance of the ship the crew uses, the same hole the original movie&apos;s survivors escaped from. In the end, the movie isn&apos;t as bad as it is often called."

      "reviewBody": "Without exaggeration, this is easily the best offering in the franchise since &apos;Return of the Jedi&apos;. Yes, it is a spin-off of a simple set-up line from the original film, but it manages to really craft it&apos;s own story around the demands of where the plot has to go by the end. While it&apos;s definitely not a character driven movie, I was surprised with the amount of time given to our key protagonists and the effort to at least make them intriguing.\n\nThe idea of another prequel movie was a hard sell; but unlike the prequel (and for that matter, the sequel) trilogy, this manages to tell it&apos;s own story within the structure of a lead-up to an event to which we already know the outcome. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna are especially effective along with secondary characters like those played by Riz Ahmed and Donnie Yen becoming easy fan favorites. Ben Mendelsohn is great as always as Krennic despite not being given much dimension as a main villain.\n\nThe character of Saw Guerrera (Forest Whitaker) seems a little cut-up and while I understand the character is better informed by one of the animated series, what we have in the film seems like it may have been a little more beefed up in earlier edits of the movie.\n\nOne thing I hear from people who don&apos;t care for this movie is the amount of fan-service moments. Random appearances of old characters or species, call-backs to famous lines and some easter-egg visuals can be a little distracting and if you don&apos;t care for that self-indulgent stuff, you&apos;ll definitely notice it here. Personally, it never really bothered me apart from one instance that lasts 5 seconds.\n\nOn a final note, while the decision to include Darth Vader was inevitable for this movie, I was so glad to see they did a little more than give him a short cameo appearance and actually give him a moment or two without leaning on him too much as a crutch to distract the audience.\n\nIf you love old Star Wars and couldn&apos;t care less about the two superfluous trilogies that followed, consider giving this a try.",

      "reviewBody": "I went to see this because of the advertised, &quot;Rear Window.&quot;\n\nThat film was an amazing experience for me. Hitchcock can be said to have invented the curious camera, the camera that moves and explores as if it were a character. It probes, it withdraws, it discovers. It &quot;finds&quot; the story. It only does in some of his films. Actually, for most of his career, he was merely a highly skilled craftsman. But then he developed this idea. With &quot;Rear Window&quot; he turned it all upside down. The camera could explore: the world had to be a stage that was composed before and for the camera.\n\nIts frozen noir. That film and &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; ended the ordinary noir period. Since then we can only reference it.\n\nJust because it is a kiddie film didn&apos;t phase me. These sometimes have the cleverest nuances, the most oblique perspectives.\n\nBut oh, not here, not here. There&apos;s the slightest nod to &quot;Rear Window,&quot; updated via &quot;Blair Witch&quot; to have the film within be a genuine film.\n\nWhat we have instead is one of those irrelevant things about teen remoteness and improbable companionship. Onto that is spliced a modern horror bit, with a cabbage patch Hannibal. And only onto that dog&apos;s mess do we have the remnant of the fixed pane.\n\nOdd, because the serial killer notion often finds its way into films with a strong story, and this is embedded as a movie within, often a counter-noir where the killer and his opposite fight for control over fate, the shape of fate.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

      "reviewBody": "This movie has generally been panned in the US by people who insist on approaching it entirely as a political satire. It is somewhat lame in that respect with a bizarro plot about a bubble-headed prostitute, &quot;Sachiko Hanai&quot; who turns into a super-genius after she is shot in the head, and then becomes embroiled in a plot by the North Koreans and Japanese Yakuza to use a cloned, disembodied finger of George W. Bush to start WWIII. (Bush, of course, is a very easy international target, but the scene where his finger sexually assaults the heroine would have been far more believable frankly if it was Bill Clinton&apos;s cloned finger).\n\nAs a nuclear-themed political satire, this is not going to make anybody forget about &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, but it&apos;s important to remember that this is basically a sex film. &quot;Sachiko Hanai&quot; is a lot more sexy and spends a lot more time naked than Peter Sellers in his three roles in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;. And the scene where she throws hot sex on a middle-aged college professor while they discuss Kirkegaard and Noam Chomsky may not be the most clever satire imaginable, but by the very lame international standards of comedy in sex films, it&apos;s positively brilliant.\n\nThis is a latter-day Japanese &quot;pink&quot; film, which is about the only genre left anywhere in the world where you have erotic films with ANYTHING of interest in them beyond the sex. If you want clever political satire, there&apos;s certainly much better movies than this. On the other hand, if you&apos;re nothing but a hairy-palmed, ceiling painter, the plot here, and the (somewhat) non-graphic sex, will no doubt only serve to distract you from the matter at, um, hand. There is always a place though as far as I&apos;m concerned for a film like this that is decently made (relatively speaking, of course) and that combines sex appeal with something that is at least a little more interesting."

Georges Lopez has that talent, that gift and this beautiful film allows adults to see what happens in something we all participate in but rarely have a chance to observe after we are adults.\n\nI found the film to be mesmerizing with it&apos;s reflections on the beauty and innocence of childhood as well as the little insights into French rural life all held together with the &quot;glue&quot; provided by the teaching of Lopez with his powerful personality.  The beauty of this personality and his extraordinary attitude towards the children in his care are the parts of this wonderfully warm documentary that linger with me after viewing the film.\n\nA person feels so humbled after watching a master at work and we must question our society&apos;s values when a man of this talent can beaver away unknown in deep pockets in urban and rural settings under valued by our society while others with far less to contribute are valued to a degree beyond worth."

I know this is for Christmas and everybody loves to settle down to a nice family treat with lovable characters and heartwarming endings but if I may say so if you are over the age of 11, this isn&apos;t really your thing! The animation is not poor but nowhere near special. The plot is kind of predictable and the characters are cute, but not memorably cute! This is more of what I say an endurance test than a heartwarming family Yuletide classic! If you are looking for Xmas Classics I strongly recommend Elf (2003) with Will Ferrell, Home Alone (1990) with Macaulay Culkin or The Polar Express (2004) with Tom Hanks because I would think you will like them better! 4/10",

It is not dependent on &quot;star&quot; power, computer generated images, overt violence, or scenes with fantastic stunts.  What it has are characters which are richly developed, believable, showing emotions which are palpable and for whom we can care.  What we find out here is simple is sometimes best.  The plot is the life and death of a friendship.  It is an interesting character study of two poor, young women.  One is outgoing and carefree while the other has been abused is more withdrawn and insecure.  The set is a small, very plain town in France which was filmed simply and often with hand held cameras. The performances by Elodie Bouchez (Isa) and Natacha Regnier (Marie) in the title characters were outstanding.  Gregorie Colin (Chris) as the boyfriend, club owner, and heel was great as well.  The film as also provides food for thought in its title especially considering the last few scenes.  I&apos;ll let you make those conclusions.  If you don&apos;t get to see this film in the theater, rent it.  Caution: the film&apos;s rating is due to a rather explicit sex scene.  Three plus stars!!!",

The style is extreme Southern Gothic, (not to be confused with camp). Some shades of Tennessee Williams but goes beyond where he dared. The dialogue is a bit difficult, and DVD has no English subtitles, but you&apos;ll be rewarded if you stick with it. (No need to understand every word). I agree that Tarantino was influenced by it but his approach to the subject matter is very different. Mandingo stands on its own as a major work of the 1970s and it&apos;s certainly a film that deserves to be better known. Striking photography and music throughout. This film panders to no one, nor does it simplistically tell the viewer what to think about anything. We have the feeling we&apos;re on our own with this. Maybe it&apos;s no accident that that feels liberating. Fasten your seat belts and see it.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on a bestseller spy novel by popular German author Johannes Mario Simmel, this 1972 movie is a boring mixture of a typical cold war political thriller and a greasy love story. It is far too long, and the direction can&apos;t decide which way to take. The tempo of the film is boring, the plot is too twisted and there are nearly no thrills at all, but dull dream sequences, stereotype love scenes, a maniac old woman talking religious stuff all the time and ridiculously produced special effects such as the explosion of a car which looks rather like a burnt plastic model. The actors also seem not very enthusiastic about their job. The only outstanding things about &quot;The things dreams are made of&quot; are the weird, electronic-orchestral sound track by the Peter Thomas Sound Orchester (&quot;Space Patrol&quot;) and an early performance by young Hannelore Elsner. Forget the rest!",

It just came in today and I have to say, it is not what I expected, but better.\n\nThis film is not about some rebel girl who runs away from home and has insane adventures. This is a movie about a girl who is desperately trying to become a part of something and the mother who follows her into a dangerous cult. It has so much more depth than I expected. The movie&apos;s hero is clearly Bat from beginning to end. However, other characters who the viewer does not expect become heroes as well. The movie shows a very scary and a very real descent into the lifestyle of a cult. The characters are unique and are uniquely duped into this life.\n\nThe acting in it is phenomenal. Ellen Page, who we now know as Juno, shows another side of herself as the resilient Bat. The character shows real strength in the face of confusion.\n\nThis movie entices and rattles the viewer. It dares to ask the question, What is a perfect world?",

I watched it again for the first time in eleven years (I am now 14). This movie is a perfect mixture of comedy, romance and drama, for me at least. I think this movie teaches great values and lessons, that everyone should learn. Loyalty, friendship and love, are only a few things about this movie that I love. Everyone should at least give it a chance and see for themselves. I also recommend &apos;My Girl 2&apos;.",

My coven (not a cult a coven) doesn&apos;t pour blood on people, deflower virgins, sacrifice animals, or torture prostitutes. This documentary even scared me, so how can anyone claim that with an open mind these religions, as seen in the film, need not be feared. No offense but was this film produced by the Catholic church? They shot every scene in the dark of night it seems, and except for the hibernation story at the end it was all about torture, sacrifice and fear.

It&apos;s based on the novel &quot;A cigánybáró&quot; (1885), by Mór Jókai, which is also the source of the operetta &quot;Die Zigeunerbaron&quot; (&quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot;) by Johann Strauss, II. Although it is not an operetta, much of Strauss&apos;s music is used as underscoring, most amusingly when the famous Pig-farmer&apos;s Song (&quot;I&apos;ve no time for learning writing. / Breeding pigs is too exciting.&quot;) is adapted as a formal gavotte.\n\nThe film is in the style of animation known as &quot;International&quot;, and a tad surreal.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Lunacy&quot; is Jan Svankmajer&apos;s homage to Edgar Allan Poe and the Marquis De Sade, (it&apos;s full of allusions to &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;), and as he tells us himself, is a horror film and not a work of art. It is certainly the first and I would argue it is also a work of art of quite a high order. It combines live-action with Svankmajer&apos;s trade-mark animation in giving us a study of what we might call &apos;the banality of evil&apos; unlike almost anything else in cinema. It is a film that moves from a barely recognizable present to some kind of past as easily as it does from live-action to animation existing in a kind of no-man&apos;s-land between the real and surreal in a manner almost guaranteed to give you the very literal creeps; this is the real thing. Yet there is also something tongue-in-cheek about the horrors Svankmajer inflicts on us. There is a giddy perversity to the picture that to a degree dissipates the director&apos;s attack on the institutions he appears to condemn. This is as much a very bizarre celebration of hedonism as it is an attack on the communist regime. There&apos;s also an asylum in the film that makes the one at Charenton look like a Wendy House. Perverse, yes but also utterly extraordinary and undoubtedly one of Svankmajer&apos;s masterpieces.",

Hearing no negative feedback (or any for that matter) I thought it looked interesting so I went to see it. Considering I was one of about 4 people in the whole theater I jumped to the conclusion that this movie was bad, and was it. The whole movie is very dark in scenery and in acting.\n\nThe movie is about a website (feardotcom.com) that if you go there some dead chick asks you if you want to play a game, and then eventually kills you. Behind the website is a snuff film maker that shows footage of him killing people &apos;erotically.&apos; The director of this movie must has some screws loose in his head. It&apos;s like a cheap cheesy very poorly done 8mm ripoff.\n\nI&apos;m all for movies in the &apos;Bottom 100&apos; of IMDB. I enjoy movies that the critics hate. But this movie just makes you wonder, who would put out money to release this?",

He cast himself as one of the two leads in this movie and it suffers because of him.\n\nHe can&apos;t act, he speaks monotonously, his demeanor is dour and completely un-interesting. The young lady in the movie is good and so are the other members of the band.\n\nMike Smith has charisma and it shows. Rick Huxley is funny. He shows a natural talent for goofing at the right time. Unfortunately these two are not allowed to have larger parts in the film.\n\nThe script is ok. It&apos;s worth watching for the mid-sixties snapshot it presents.\n\nBut Dave Clark? Yeesh!",

      "reviewBody": "I think that there seem to be some confusion expressed in a number of the reviews of this and a subsequent version of Jean Rhys&apos; most famous novel. Just for information:\n\n1. Creole does not necessarily imply mixed race. Bertha (to use Rochester&apos;s name for her) was clearly white enough to appear white and indeed, like Jean Rhys herself, may have been entirely of European ancestry. The mixed race brother, Daniel, was black on his mother&apos;s side which has nothing to do with Bertha&apos;s mother being mostly/entirely French. He was angry and destructive because his father preferred the white daughter to him.\n\n2. The Wide Sargosso Sea is a sort of prequel but it is also a re-imagining of the back story for Jane Eyre that is intended to take Bertha&apos;s character and expand on it with Rhys inability to ever fully reconcile herself to the differences between her origins and life in Europe.\n\n3. While we think of the Caribbean as a dominantly black environment, the origins were Carib Indian and whites colonized the area before the introduction of African slaves. The racial undertone is a more modern view than Bronte likely had. She was trying to deal with the whole idea of foreignness/strangeness and the ultimate solution to the plight of Jane&apos;s situation, poor but of &quot;gentle&quot; birth.\n\n4. Of the two filmed versions, the first makes the characters too physically attractive and really misses the novel&apos;s stress on the protagonists never meshing rather than loving and losing love.\n\n5. One problem with the casting of Rochester in the first version is that the actor portraying Rochester is distractingly gorgeous and not sufficiently British (apart from his accent). In fact he looks like he rather fits in, in contrast to Bertha&apos;s uncle and the other European planters. Of course, the actress who portrays Bertha, even at the end, is so enticing that Rochester&apos;s loss of interest is inexplicable.\n\n6. The first film seems to run out of time and rushes the end. Not enough is made of Rochester&apos;s anger at being manipulated, whether by voodoo, drugs or circumstances. Once he becomes his father&apos;s heir, the return to England should have led to something other than the conclusion. There is definitely insufficient deterioration in Bertha. Their stories are mirror images. He deteriorates and is miserable where she is able to live and she deteriorates where he is able to live.\n\n7. The novels (both Jane Eyre and The Wide Sargosso Sea) have a great deal of narration which is lost in the earlier film and perhaps insufficient in the second. None of the films are substitutes for the books but all are interesting reimaginings.\n\n8. In order to appreciate the Rhys novel, one should read about the author. The same is true of Jane Eyre and its author. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nFinally, while not great, the films both aspire to be literary, which means a lot in an age when filmmakers think there is a need for horror/splatter movies and lots of people apparently agree so I for one say thank you for both versions of the Wide Sargosso Sea and all of the versions of Jane Eyre that offer relief from the current tripe.",

      "reviewBody": "The title might suggest a cheap hybrid of Carrie and Death Wish, but Massacre at Central High is not your typical drive-in movie. Granted it&apos;s filled with violence, blood, and nudity, and the revenge angle is quite powerful, but its examination of high-school politics is the element that really gets your brain working. \n\nWe&apos;ve all experienced it--the Jerk Jock gets transferred to another school, and right away someone fills his position as King of the Cretins. Those at the top of the social structure exercise their ultimately negligible powers in order to make themselves feel bigger and better than everyone else. It is this tradition that Massacre at Central High pierces with a razor-sharp skewer. \n\nUnfortunately, the picture is very hard to find in this age of sickening political correctness. A typical knee-jerk reaction would be to say that films like this glorify school violence--currently a big concern. But, as always, that sort of viewpoint is formulated without really looking at the message of the project. Yes, it&apos;s violent. Yes, it deals with a teenager killing other teenagers. But ultimately, what does this accomplish? No matter how many are killed, they&apos;re immediately replaced. Violence does not solve the problem. THIS is the point, and it&apos;s stated with a subtle brilliance that really hits home.\n\nOf course, this underground classic also benefits from a terrific exploitation cast and an imaginative approach to the material. The scratchy, grainy color cinematography has a low-budget beauty that not everyone can appreciate. The melding of professional and amateurish elements results in a genuinely tense, scary experience...but one with much more to offer than your typical psycho epic."

      "reviewBody": "Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me. At age 15, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance. As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to work hard at it, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and he would do better in their next pairings. However, observing his physique, it&apos;s easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat. Though Gene Kelly&apos;s personality and dancing dominated this film, his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see the fresh-faced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a &quot;thrill&quot; killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder from the 1920s. An additional note: One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra&apos;s love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Greg (Ed Begley, Jr.) has moved his wife and two daughters, Melissa and Emily, from California to a remote, forested community in the Northwest. Melissa seems to be adjusting but Emily is having a very difficult time, at school and at home. This changes when Emily finds a darling little bear cub wandering near the family home. Emily carries her up to her own room, intent on having a furry new bunkmate. Needless to say, the bear cub, named &quot;Masha&quot;, is not something she can keep secret for long. Father Greg is upset, decrees Emily can not have the bear as a pet, and takes the little cub to work. From there, Greg calls the conservation division and urges them to pick up the bear. However, Masha is very smart, escapes their clutches, and heads back home. Somewhere in the disturbance, Greg finds himself mistrusting the conservation officer&apos;s intentions (as well he should) and allows Emily to hide the bear in their yard. But, for how long? And, isn&apos;t there a mother bear out there somewhere, looking for her baby?This is a darling, darling film that should have gotten more exposure. The bears in the film, a mother and a cub, are adorable and talented to the extreme. Just watch Emily bake cookies with Masha or try on clothes with the little bear. If your heart doesn&apos;t melt, you might consider taking your pulse. The scenery is stunning, the cast very fine (the lovely actress playing the mother is most interesting), and the production values nice for a low budget film. Families everywhere, please go get this film from whatever store or library that has it available or order it online. This movie is a keeper to enjoy often and to pass along to relatives and friends, too.",

The story behind the making of the film is even more interesting than the movie itself. You can tell from this movie that Robert Rodriguez had a bright future in the movie business.\n\nThe story is about a musician who&apos;s trying to find work in a Mexican border town. None of the places he visits wants to hire a guitar player for their business. Meanwhile another man comes to town carrying a guitar case, he&apos;s no musician. He&apos;s a notorious hit man for a local gangster. When their paths cross, nothing but trouble lies ahead for the El Mariachi. Can the poor dude survive the week without being killed? Who is this guitar carrying killer? Why is he in town? What are the local crime boss&apos; motives? To find out you&apos;ll have to watch EL MARIACHI!!!\n\nAn interesting debut that showed lots of promise. The movie was followed by a pseudo-sequel/remake a few years later with a bigger budget and a cast filled with a lot of named actors.\n\nHighly recommended.",

Barbara Stanwyck, with her crafty stare and sexy smirk, surprisingly doesn&apos;t run roughshod over articulate Henry Fonda, and they make a winning combination. Sturges&apos; script blends grown-up jokes and conversation with pratfalls while never losing the filmmaker&apos;s graceful touch and innate sophistication. The results are amusingly frisky, prickly and unpredictable. *** from ****",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this at the Japanese Film Festival in Sydney and I thought it was fantastic. The whole story is clichéd as a whole, however with all the plot twists changing directions you have to just let it take you where it wants to go.\n\nThe story involves a young boy who lost his mother and was confined to a wheel-chair from a car accident. He spends his time locked in is room, using a robot that he can communicate from his computer as his eyes to the outside world.\n\nSome moments in the film could be considered to many audiences as quite corny, however, the darker elements manage to balance the film as a whole quite nicely. At times the film feels it gets a bit long too, however this is only because there are so many ideas crammed into it that sometimes you really have no idea where it is going and are wanting to find a resolution all too soon. The ending, however, is far more than satisfying enough.\n\nUse of cg is really great too, although it is usually saved for the right moments so that it is most effective. The use of first person perspectives and computer game footage was masterfully utilized to make interesting comparisons between reality and virtual-reality. Much more interesting than it was in say, Doom.\n\nI think the most important thing about this film though, is that the characters are presented in ways that you can only feel compassion for them. You get the sense that the makers also felt the same way.\n\nVerdict: You&apos;ll laugh, you&apos;ll cry.",

      "name": "About mirrors on a moonlit night.",
      "reviewBody": "There is a proverb: &quot;There is nothing to blame on the mirror, if the face is crooked.&quot; Therefore, no one likes mirrors, so everyone sees something demonic in them, so well reflected (pun intended!) in world-class works of art. In Russia, mirrors have long been accepted to close and curl, and if not, then at the mirror at the ready, like a guard on duty, always hung an embroidered towel, which always reached the hands on the night of the full moon, the night of truth... Dmitri Frolov doesn&apos;t like to tell stories. He likes to show. In addition, he always preferred the image (Frolov is a good artist ) to the vulgar sound, madly loving the &quot;great silent&quot; and once and for all deciding that cinema is a kind of visual art, but nothing more. Only sometimes, going to meet the spoilt noise effects of the modern venerable audience, Dmitri Frolov accompanies the spectacle with simple music, however, without changing the chosen style: in the cinemas of the beginning of the last century, films also went to the accompaniment of starved tapers. But, despite such a secondary attitude to them, many of the old half-forgotten melodies that have become popular again in recent years, it was the director Frolov who first &quot;dug up&quot; (the immortal &quot;Sixteen Tons &quot;already sounded in the first and then only part of&quot; Nights&quot;, shocking with its novelty and unknown), but while he was putting on a boater and searching for a lost cane, he was overtaken by grasping DJs in a more modern outfit. Isn&apos;t that sad? Yes, it&apos;s sad... Dmitry Frolov is the real name of the director. It&apos;s not an alias. Therefore, Dmitry can calmly, without strain and pathos, talk on the screen about many pressing problems of life. For a film like &quot;The Bigmoon Nights&quot;, this is a significant trump card, since the title role in it is &quot;performed&quot; by the Russian forest at the beginning and &quot;stone jungle&quot; - at the epic end. The ancient Slavic tribes loved the forest, because it gave them shelter, shelter, and food. Only later, closer to the emergence of Kievan Rus, the popular imagination populated the forest with terrible monsters and enveloped the fog of dark legends... The desire to turn the love of the Motherland with the love of birches is ridiculous: the tree is a notorious cosmopolitan. Birch trees also grow in Germany. Just as cosmopolitan is the &quot;stone jungle&quot;: New York in this sense is not much different from St. Petersburg (not the birthplace of Tom Sawyer, but the former capital of Russia). The wandering of the main character of &quot;Nights&quot;, thus, ends in a dead end: he came to the same place from where he started his journey, but while he wandered in search of something he alone needed and understood, his house turned into a garbage dump, where it is no longer a shame to commit a crime... Disgusting? Yes, it&apos;s disgusting... Most of Dmitri Frolov&apos;s films are plotless. That is, there are so many overlapping plots in one film that you can&apos;t always keep track of them. The movie &quot;The Bigmoon Nights&quot; is much deeper and more ambiguous than it just seemed to you. In essence, this is a mirror (not very crooked), which reflects our recent past, on which we had such hopes, but it turned out not to look like the ending of the novel by Nikolai Gavrilovich Chernyshevsky &quot; What to Do?&quot;. Now we have no special hopes, we have come to the beginning, having described a circle. We&apos;ll sit for a while, pretend to think, and then we&apos;ll start walking again, so that we can go around and look in the mirror again. Will we be disgusted, sad, and disgusted again? Another Frolov will tell us about this in other &quot;The Bigmoon Nights&quot;, nights of truth...",

Much more violent as well, although lacking much of the political overtones of its predecessor (as it is, violence feels almost glamorized at times).\n\nHowever, it can definitely stand on its own.  Telling the story of a bizarre love triangle between a school intellect turned gangster, a teenage thug turned teacher, and a noodle shop owner, it makes for an interesting comedy which takes on some rather screw-ball tendencies.\n\nDespite the sometimes gritty subject matter, the heart of the film is all about friendship (almost in the same vein as John Woo&apos;s &quot;The Killer&quot;, even), with the rivalries of the two main characters being cast aside when necessary."

      "reviewBody": "There are many films that deal with the sensitive subject matter of child abuse. They typically fall into two categories: those that attempt to treat the subject matter with complexity and seriousness, and those that exploit the subject matter to sensationalize and trivialize the issue. This film pretends to be the first but falls into the latter category.\n\nPinky Cheung plays a HK police inspector who recounts a particularly disturbing case she has been working on to friends and strangers at a Penthouse BBQ party. The case involves a young girl who died as a result of injuries suffered at her mother&apos;s hand, but was later revealed by the police autopsy to have endured repeated sexual assaults over a period of time. As the investigation unfolds, the mother&apos;s boyfriend is implicated as the culprit of the sexual abuse, as well as having made child pornography videos with the young girl. While the mother (played by Leila Tong) feigns ignorance, a police commissioner (played by Maggie Siu) who personally took charge of the case believes there are some unanswered questions and decides to torture the mother to induce answers.\n\nThis is where the film becomes &quot;sexploitation&quot;, as we are treated to lengthy scenes where the mother is humiliated and assaulted by the police commissioner and her subordinates, who seem completely oblivious to their role in perpetuating the cycle of violence and abuse. Ironically, the cycle of abuse turns out to be the answer to the &apos;unanswered questions&apos; that plagued the police commissioner (and in the process, we learn something about the motivations of the police commissioner which turns out to be stupidly simplistic).\n\nGiven that the acting here is also sub-par, there is really nothing else worth salvaging from this film. The combination of an elementary moral message and the film&apos;s category III rating makes this an &quot;after school special&quot; for adults."

I enjoyed it and it was what I had expected.Many of you gave it negative criticisms; what did they expect from a film about a young girl coming to the city? This was a simple story about a young shy girl with dreams trying to make it in show business; which is hard if you don&apos;t have the right connections.The dance numbers and bar scene were very realistic. As a New Yorker, I was happy to see that she wasn&apos;t mugged or worse as many films about New York portray.I&apos;d like a sequel."

      "reviewBody": "The story of the 1950 United States World Cup soccer team&apos;s stunning upset victory over England is one which has been begging to be told for years. One of the great sports underdog stories of all time and hardly anyone knows a thing about it. Many younger American soccer fans don&apos;t even know it happened. Finally, this movie has come along to shed some well-deserved light on those players who toiled mostly in anonymity and whose achievements seemed lost in the dustbin of history. It is wonderful that this movie was made. You just wish the movie had been made better. The Game of Their Lives or The Miracle Match or whatever they&apos;re calling it these days never quite hits the heights. It tells a story which needed to be told. It just doesn&apos;t tell it in an entertaining enough way.\n\nThis movie is cut from the tried and true sports underdog movie mold (Hoosiers, Rocky, Rudy and so on) but it never has the same sense of energy which drove those films forward. While those films had a certain zest to them as they built towards a thrilling conclusion this film just kind of slogs along. It&apos;s not nearly as engrossing as it could have, and given the great story they had to work with, probably should have been. The fact that certain details of history have been twisted and changed to try to make things seem more dramatic than they actually were doesn&apos;t help either. A misguided attempt to create a &quot;villain&quot; on the English team also falls flat. It seems the filmmakers were afraid to allow this story to speak for itself and were determined to spice it up with some artificial drama. The fake drama doesn&apos;t work and we&apos;re not left with enough real drama either.\n\nThis is not to say that The Game of Their Lives (or The Miracle Match or whatever) is a bad movie. It&apos;s OK. You just get the sense that this story deserved a movie which is better than just OK. The acting is fine with Gerard Butler and Wes Bentley the key figures in a cast which otherwise is made up of mostly unknowns with the exception of, oh sweet irony, Englishman Patrick Stewart as the American soccer reporter who serves as the film&apos;s narrator while relishing the memory of the English defeat. The visuals are very good and the soccer scenes quite well done. But what&apos;s lacking is drama. The film never really grabs you, from the &quot;getting to know you&quot; phase as we meet the players all the way through the &quot;thrilling&quot; climax which comes off as rather ordinary. And what the U.S. team achieved in Brazil in 1950 was anything but ordinary. Unfortunately the full impact of what those men accomplished and who those men really were doesn&apos;t come across in this film. And that&apos;s a shame.",

      "reviewBody": "This much maligned and very strange Western is ambitious and interesting in places, but also pretentious, convoluted, silly and frequently boring. Shepard&apos;s direction is reasonable, and the main theme effective, but the ghost scenes are accompanied by a poor, pounding score and increasingly daft camera-work. The acting is similarly inconsistent: Mulroney is dire in a well-written minor role, and Bates overacts dreadfully, but Harris is fairly good and Phoenix unforgettable (if underused) in his final role. His first scene is particularly potent and moving. Indeed, whenever River is on screen the movie comes to life: his eccentric turn partly compensating for the long periods of poorly scripted shouting.\n\nDespite some striking imagery, unusual subject matter and unwanted status as River&apos;s swansong, the film&apos;s expected cult status hasn&apos;t materialised, perhaps because it is plot less and pointless. Filmed for French TV in 1992, but not released until 1994, it grossed just $61,274 in the US. For a better, similarly offbeat modern take on the Western, try Jim Jarmusch&apos;s Dead Man. Silent Tongue is for Phoenix completists like myself only."

      "reviewBody": "One of the best political satirical comedies in years! &apos;In The Loop&apos; is a spin-off (kind-of) of the fantastic British comedy &apos;The Thick of It&apos;, and follows Simon Foster (Tom Hollander), a Cabinet Minister who makes a series of unfortunate slip-ups, the first is when he tells an interviewer that he believes war (always referred to as the invasion or the war, but never Iraq or potentially Afghanistan) is &quot;unforeseeable&quot; before telling journalists under pressure that you have to conquer a mountain of conflict on the path of peace. These mistakes place him in the middle of a diplomatic mine-field as both, the anti-war constabulary led by General Miller (James Gandolfini) and the Assistant Secretary of Diplomacy Karen Clark (Mimi Kennedy), and the gung-ho supporter of war Linton Barwick (David Rasche) - so crazy he keeps a live grenade as a paperweight - want Simon as a transatlantic partner to support their cause. Should he put his conscience or his political career first? Oh, and throw in hilariously vicious Senior British Press Office Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi) and a bumbling Adviser to the minster (Toby played by Chris Addison) and you have one of the best political satires to come from Britain in years.\n\nWhat makes the film work so well is the incredibly sharp witty script from a collaboration of writers that keeps the gag-per-minute counter ticking. Every meeting, confrontation political mishap is cradled with joke after joke whether they are subtle references to the cynicism and underhandedness in the current (or foregone) political climate or simply one of Malcolm Tucker&apos;s fantastic rants – &quot;I&apos;m going to tear out your shinbone, split it in two and stab you to f**king death with it&quot; - at ineptitude of everybody around him. Every actor and actress involved give solid performances as the flawed members of the tense political world. While Simon&apos;s central story keeps the film on the ground despite a few diplomatic detours (that are still hilarious, even though they take up little of the running of time).\n\nArmando Iannucci has already proved to the British public that he can create entertainment for the TV-masses and &apos;In The Loop&apos; proves he also has the skills to replicate this on a wider, international, big-screen scale as well. It&apos;s intelligent, it&apos;s offensive, and it&apos;s bleeding funny. See this film!",

      "name": "A fine costume drama, but not one that really makes itself be felt",
      "reviewBody": "While this may share the same source material as Patrice Chéreau&apos;s picture of the same name to follow forty years later, there&apos;s no mistaking that Jean Dréville&apos;s rendition of &apos;La reine Margot&apos; is its own picture. Likewise adapted from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, this 1954 film boasts the same narrative essence. It can claim beautiful sets and filming locations, and elaborate costume design, in imparting a tale of murder, massacre, deceit, manipulation, and backstabbing. And recognizing that the film-making sensibilities of the 50s were not the same as those of the 90s, early cinematic master Abel Gance penned a screenplay that deftly communicates the story while maintaining a feeling of restraint, and mostly declining sensationalism. There are sturdy foundations here.\n\nUnfortunately, for all that Chéreau and Dréville share in common, the utmost high quality is not entirely among them. Dréville&apos;s feature is good, and there are some moments that are done especially well in one fashion or another. Yet that broad declination of sensationalism also results in a presentation so even-keeled that dynamics, urgency, and major drama are diminished in the process. This is in addition to Dréville&apos;s direction coming across as a little weak, or even scattered, further dampening the weight of the tale at hand - and whether Gance&apos;s adaptation or Dréville&apos;s direction is more to blame I don&apos;t know, but there are points where it seems to me like this 1954 movie is deficient in basic details like identifying characters, or the relationships between them, or even conveying the plot with total fidelity.\n\nThe acting is fine, but struggles to make much of an impression through the flatness that reduces the drama. The editing is sometimes quite curt, and rough around the edges, and there are choices here even of lighting that raise a curious eyebrow. Fantastic as the sets are, every now and again the artifice is more readily evident; I do quite like the costume design, though it&apos;s noteworthy that the tights portend the more jovial gaiety that defines no few sequences as this &apos;La reine Margot&apos; carries itself in no small measure more like an outright swashbuckler. Where that isn&apos;t true, what is true is that this feels like a relatively simple, unbothered costume drama, and one that just particularly make the audience feel the import of the saga on hand. It&apos;s not bad - but nor is it especially noteworthy or remarkable.\n\nI did enjoy watching, on some level. But there&apos;s nothing about this so striking as to demand viewership, and moreover, even at its best it comes off as a title that would take low priority standing next to most anything else one could watch. Stand it next to Chéreau&apos;s film and, well, the very word &quot;comparison&quot; seems unfair. It&apos;s a decent way to spend a couple hours, but nothing you need to go out of your way to see. 1954&apos;s &apos;La reine Margot&apos; is worth checking out and remembering - with the caveat that it&apos;s just not everything that it could have been.",

Jack Baker is along for the ride as a yuppie pimp which makes fun of his previous roles. It&apos;s stacked with legendary ladies with Traci Lords putting in a fun performance that echoes what she&apos;ll later do in John Water&apos;s CRY BABY. Some of the shots are a little icky/crude close-up wise, but overall I thought this one worked a lot better than those that came before.",

Dillon&apos;s was the first film to be shot in Cambodia since the 1960s, and the unfamiliar setting contributes much to the movie&apos;s allure. &quot;City of Ghosts&quot; has a remarkable look and feel that lend it resonance and lead one to anticipate Dillon&apos;s further outings as a director.\n\nThe actors fit nicely into their roles and deliver strong performances. Sereyvuth Kem, a real-life Cambodian cyclo driver, leaves a lasting impression as Jimmy&apos;s loyal friend Sok. The film&apos;s soundtrack- a heady international collection of pop music mixed with Tyler Bates&apos; evocative score - adds another layer to the already-rich atmosphere. Stick around during the end credits for some of the best exit music in recent memory."

      "reviewBody": "Hi all,\n\nthis is the perfect example of YASM = yet another stereotype movie. Movies like this only contribute to increase the bad image that people in the world have of such a beautiful land like Sicily.\n\nAs a Sicilian man living abroad, tho, in Finland, I have been listening for ages the comments on movies like the Godfather. Incredible but true, people still think that in Sicily we live like that. Luckily enough, this movie will not be able to make as many damages as the world-famous &quot;Godfather&quot;.\n\nThe movie, set in the &apos;70s, is sort of a biographic story of a girl, with Sicilian father and Finnish mother, and a younger sister. They moved to Sicily and ... since then the movie can be summarized in four words: Sicily = hell Finland = paradise\n\nSicily is not the perfect world and Finland is an indeed very nice country. In fact, I live here. But you cannot give such an unbalanced picture of the world. The result? I can already read &quot;motherly advices&quot; of other users, who are Finnish (swedish speaking, which is probably a benefit, if they need to specify it) but are more retrograde of the Sicilian characters of the movie. \n\nThe movie has already done the damage, because the motherly advice consists in considering the relationship with a Mexican guy, apparently on the basis that he is Mexican (and therefore, almost Sicilian, here the comment is not clear). \n\nSorry for breaking a bit the rule of not commenting other posts, but I did it to give an example on how the movie can spoil the image of Sicily. \n\nMy recommendation: if you want to watch it, it is your choice, but BE CAREFUL that Sicily is far other thing. Go visit it if you don&apos;t believe it. BR Simone Italian-speaking Italian. (Often pronounced as Simone by my beloved grandmother, who was Sicilian-speaking)",

      "reviewBody": "Of similar confection as the first film, this one opts to show more rumbles in the actual ring rather than outside, which makes the fights less potent, the battles between the heroes and villains are significantly reduced, making the whole thing a bit lacking. The rhythm it&apos;s less fluid, stopping at several points to admire the static spectacle, from wrestling to filler songs.\n\nCuriel directs with the same unpreoccupied spirit, now much more observing and wanderer than before, with even less interest in telling than in showing events, although always taking advantage of its free form to travel without restriction across the scenarios, capturing the events and subjects with a detached but contemplative view.\n\nConsisting of scenes of dilated duration that would only take two or three fragments in any other movie, the film delights itself without measure in the ambients and actions that conform it&apos;s elongated sequences, slowing the narrative development to an unusual degree, to the point where the main villain doesn&apos;t reveal her plans until the last ten minutes of the film. Once arriving at the similarly careless third act, the film takes its ending for granted and resolves its climax by skipping over the self-evident aspects of the story formula and going directly to the resolution.\n\nCuriel typically offers a kind of erratic alternative to commercial cinema, often squeezing and extending the events of its barebones plot in joyfully artificial ways, delivering a story as abstract as its construction. Unfeasible regurgitation of superhero and wrestling hero comic book tropes. Potent yet loose and ludic addition to wrestling cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t think I quite understood what &quot;Querelle&quot; was about but the good aspect of it is that you at each view you get new things, and it grows on you. Far from being a masterpiece like &quot;Ali: Fear Eats the Soul&quot; or &quot;The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant&quot;, but this is a very good project directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, his last and the one he got some of the heaviest criticism of his career. In a way, the most tragical of all of his works after being forced to cut part of it to get a release in America, probably the first time he ever had to back down and cut something he directed.\n\nBased on author Jean Genet&apos;s 1947 novel Querelle de Brest, the movie revolves about Querelle, an Belgian sailor (Brad Davis) who plays with danger with his criminal affairs selling opium and his involvement with male and female, using of his good looks to get what he wants. To him (and to everyone around him) everything&apos;s a game in which losing sometimes can be useful (the dice game where he deliberately loses in order to have sex with Nuno, played by Gunther Kauffman). Querelle&apos;s a man with many love affairs and relations, center of attention of his own brother (Hanno Pöschl), and their strange &quot;brotherhood&quot;, love/hate kind of thing; Nuno, his wife (Jeanne Moreau) owner of a decadent bar where most of the film takes place, and he&apos;s treasured from distance by his captain (Franco Nero). The other half of the film explores what can be called of real love between Querelle and a murderer (who is played by the same actor who plays the brother).\n\nThe movie is very open when it comes to presenting Querelle&apos;s involvements with both genders, specially his sexual scenes with another men, very bold at the time. If the story gets too much on a second plan, since the ideas are somewhat vague, foggy, the high point of enjoyment of the film is seeing Querelle getting well with his mates. For the most part, the movie isn&apos;t so exciting and is very confusing with its imposition of ideas one on top of another. What&apos;s the story in deeper terms? A man discovering his sexuality, trying new things or he&apos;s trying to find real love? Is he testing his moves as a player or he&apos;s just a man trying to survive using of his talents? Fassbinder intrigues us more with the whole concept of man being a product of his environment, adapting to his (and others) needs and what he makes here (don&apos;t know if the same happen in the book) is a strange fantasy world where everyone is bisexual or have more inclination towards another man, enjoying endless sunsets created on fake sets, surrounded by large columns resembling phallic elements. The script is more like a literary work than a cinematic experience, with several cards expressing Querelle&apos;s inner thoughts or the captain&apos;s romantic narration watching the love of his life, working all sweaty.\n\nRainer had his reasons and perhaps we&apos;ll never know what motivated him making this film in the way he did, but the artist is deeply immersed in this work, putting elements of his life, his love and all (including a dedication to El-Hedi Ben Salem, one of his partners, who died that year). A little bit butchered, panned by critics and part of the public, a distressing experience to the director who wasn&apos;t much in his best moment in life but with career on the top, but sadly he died and this was his last film. Not much of a great swan song but very admirable in several ways. The risk taken by Brad Davis was incredible and unfortunately he paid the price for it, barely appearing on well-known films or great projects. But what a performance! He&apos;s really good, very desirable and makes the character be what he needs to be. How many times you&apos;ve seen a film where it is sold to us someone who is so beautiful and attracts everything and everyone but when you look at, it doesn&apos;t cause such effect? Davis was all that.\n\nHere&apos;s a tale about immorality, manipulation, the right of the strongest to conquer anything, ultimately about the individuals who kill the things he love. Men, essentially. 7/10",

      "reviewBody": "When the trailer boasted the producers of &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; and &quot;Insidious&quot; the idea of what tone this film would be reared it&apos;s head. Based around a series of jump scare sequences and slow character sections in order to attempt to make you feel for the characters while easing the tension of the situation. It&apos;s a tired formula that is becoming all the more clichéd and repetitive. However Sinister manages to find ways to break free of these leashes that the horror genre is becoming tied down to.\n\nEthan Hawk stars as a true crime writer known as Ellison who moves into a new home with his wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and his two children, Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D&apos;Addario) near the site of a local crime in order to get inspiration for his novel. During an exploration of the house Ellison stumbles across a box with an 8mm camera and a selection of films, which upon viewing exploit gruesome murders. This thrusts area hero into a terrifying mystery as he tries to piece together the meaning behind it all.\n\nWith horror films these days we come to know what to expect. We&apos;re given characters that we can&apos;t connect with merely there to service the plot and an un-original story that we&apos;ve seen time and time again bringing the audience no sense of engagement. But mostly we&apos;re never scared beyond the mere technique of a jump scare. With director Scott Derrickson we are shown again how mainstream horror can creep on us with effective imagery and suggestion. The scares here can be portrayed by just using obscure camera angles and bizarre images that unsettle us. Derrickson understands though that using loud bands and noises to jolt the audience can be done effectively. By backing up these moments with his strong imagery he uses it as a tactic to implant these horrific moments in our minds.\n\nThe highlight however is the use of the 8mm films. Sinister is in love with the idea of film, from celluloid to digital as not only are we treated to disturbing super 8 films but Ellison boasts are large collection of VHS tapes of his old achievements. It&apos;s a nice, simple touch that film fans will appreciate. These 8mm films though boast some truly graphic sequences, one particularly involving a garden tool. Backed with a moody soundtrack by Christopher Young who&apos;s worked on other horror gems such as &quot;Drag Me To Hell&quot; and &quot;The Exorcism of Emily Rose&quot;. It feels more of an ambiance piece rather than a fully diegetic score merging together a series of dark and effective sounds building the feeling of dread constantly throughout.\n\nWritten by Derrickson himself and writer C. Robert Cargill the screenplay manages for the most part to push past the bland formula we&apos;ve grown to endure with horror films of late. The film brings an intriguing plot that manages to put you in the position of Ellison&apos;s character, uncovering the plot and mystery when he does. There are scenes in which are hero re-visits the 8mm films and discovers new elements to them which adds a new depth to the story. The film feels relentless, rarely taking time to slow down and constantly feeling as though it&apos;s propelling towards something. However elements of the script are where the weaker parts of the film shine. While managing to bring interesting uses of horror and tension the film often retreads over clichéd ground as though it&apos;s trying to keep a warm attitude towards mainstream audiences. These are the times when the film feels as though it may lose focus but always manages to pick up its feet again. Alongside this we have some underused side and poorly written characters such as a police deputy who doesn&apos;t feel natural within the whole scale of things.\n\nSinister may tread over worn ground by it still manages to feel fresh and revitalizing in an age where we&apos;ve conformed to the degrading standards of horror. It embraces the roots of horror and film in general making it much more than a homage and a feeling of an original yet genuinely terrifying story. Hawk manages to carry the emotional tangent of the narrative while the other characters are merely serviceable. It&apos;s not groundbreaking but for a mainstream horror film it takes some inventive and daring steps creating a terrifying, disturbing yet absorbing piece of cinema.\n\n4/5 Stars.",

If there is one thing I WOULDN&apos;T have changed, it was the part where the Time Traveler finally figures it all out: the Eloi are merely fatted cattle and the Morlocks are their &quot;cowboys.&quot; In the book it comes through that the Eloi are not particularly good and the Morlocks aren&apos;t really evil- both groups are merely evolutionary products. Of course, theater audiences in 1960 wouldn&apos;t have accepted this.\n\nBack to the film: the story is touching and I liked the sets and model-work. I have the DVD and I have watched it multiple times. And THAT is an endorsement."

The comments regarding the CGI again I think aren&apos;t fair, I can&apos;t say having watched it I noticed anything off about them.\n\nThe plot is decent, acting good, I think the ending does let it down a little in reality.\n\nOverall it was better than I expected it to be given the other harsh reviews.

As a bickering couple, Rayveness is quite effective, especially when talking dirty during her sex scene with miscast (as a pool boy!)

      "reviewBody": "A low-key and wry modern-day western from the early-&apos;70s. Filmed in Arizona and Northern Mexico in the spring and early summer of 1971 and shown in cinemas in that most downbeat of hippy years -1972: it records the &apos;feel&apos; of the early-&apos;70s which were pioneering years so well. Jim Kane (good-looking blue-eyed US actor Paul Newman) is a naive, broke and in debt cowpoke i.e. An everyman and loser. Needing the money, he agrees to work for a pair of crooked rodeo cattle dealers -Bill Garrett (Strother Martin) and Stretch Russell (Wayne Rogers) who hire him to squire 250 steers from Mexico to Arizona. Kane locates his equally broke buddy Leonard (Lee Marvin) in a Mexican hotel room and the two undertake the imprudent business venture with failed results marked by their inability to make astute decisions. The inner rhythm of the film is strange, languid and existential with Beckettian undertones. It features some great scenes - the sun-bleached urban aesthetics of Nogales, Phoenix, Chihuahua and Hermosilla and the enchanted and evocative interior scenes featuring exotic Mexican bordellos, bars, mariachi/rock and roll musicians, street hucksters etc plus the barren cattle lands of Northern Mexico and the Mexican transport/rail infrastructure ca. &apos;71-72 all recorded by ace Hungarian cameraman Laszlo Kovacs. Leonard - who sports white hair, a &apos;Forties style suit, fedora hat and jazzy tie in one scene is seen imbibing olives, fajitas, tacos, chili and the Cuervos-brand of tequila. Pocket Money is in my top ten films of all time.",

It&apos;s not Broadway nor is it MARVEL superheroes, but it&apos;s quality entertainment worth watching more than once. On another note, it was AWESOME seeing the lead singer of one of my all time favorite bands in this; even though he does something quite hilarious!",

They actually interact well but Rita&apos;s part is minor considering her star status, by this point she was beginning to really suffer with memory loss and her scenes were a trial to complete, and the story is weak. Claudia is lovely but totally unbelievable as Duke&apos;s daughter speaking with her natural Italian accent while supposedly being raised by him, he of course talks like John Wayne. Not a terrible film but diffuse and without a strong point of view, that may be because the production was fraught with issues, begun by Frank Capra and finished by Henry Hathaway there was no clear vision to the shape what the film was supposed to offer.",

Van Cleef does a good job, but Brown is his normal stiff as a board self. I found he was the same in real life when I met him in 1980. He knew someone I worked with from his football days and I guess he brought him to work to prove he really did know him. Patrick O&apos;Neal as a Mexican is hilarious!\n\nThe highlight is the Marianna Hill nude scene, but there are a lot of explosions and action to pass the time quickly enough. There are a lot of worse ways to spend an evening."

After seeing the first i didn&apos;t know when the super subs dream was going to end, but at Real Madrid with superstars surrounding him, i thought i was in for a treat. But to my mistake, the storyline steers of course of the footballing world bringing in a twist of family life which was almost suddenly killed of by the stress of which football brings. Every little boy&apos;s dream is to play football at a professional level but this film gives us an inside view as to what goes on off the pitch and in my opinion doesn&apos;t have enough twists in the story. As i&apos;m a football fanatic i loved the matches they played and the 3-2 comeback in the Champions League final was amazing but so predictable. Overall i feel the film was a failure but is still worth watching so that there is some hope that GOAL III can impress and revive the disappointment of GOAL II. Daniel Bryson",

Wells, the film involves a group of prospective land buyers led by a land developer, pitted against giant, mutated ants.\n\nThis was one of Bert Gordon&apos;s final films, and from a technical standpoint it is among his best. The production value looks much higher than his earlier work, and the star power of the cast is evident. The ants, while still relying on a few cheap effects, are overall pretty effective -- though why must they be screeching the entire time? But really, what makes this only a &quot;good&quot; film rather than a &quot;really good&quot; film is the length. This is clearly a 60 or 70-minute film stretched out to 90 minutes, and that allows for the ultimate sin to creep in: boredom.",

      "name": "With only a few engaging moments in the first half, this is the weakest film from the director unexpectedly.",
      "reviewBody": "BR begins on a very uninspiring note unlike director&apos;s previous films and when one gets to see an item song within the first 10 minutes only all of a sudden, it becomes pretty clear that this has not been made as per the exact vision of the person behind films like HAASIL, CHARAS, SHAGIRD and PAAN SINGH TOMAR. Yes, BULLETT RAJA too has got a part of that raw, unforgiving and realistic Tigmanshu feel in its initial moments using the local dialect and settings. But an all predictable screenplay &amp; sloppy editing actually plays the main spoilt sport here wherein things keep happening too easily for the main lead and therefore their journey of becoming &apos;Political Commandos&quot; from the common man largely remains less impressive and unconvincing. Still the film does have some irregular engaging moments arising out of its well written enjoyable dialogues in the first half, along with few poor songs. \n\nBut once many of its notable characters vanish altogether as per the story progression, it all becomes quite dull and the film falls drastically post intermission having nothing new to serve other than the usual revenge drama. To save it from sinking further, the writers bring in a fresh character of Vidyut Jammwal in the last 40 minutes of the film playing the tough inspector with some new twists and turns. But the move fails to provide any major lift and it all ends with an open climax as we have already seen several times before in the recent times. \n\nIn few words, the director who is known for coming up with some fresh films following his own unique way of execution surprisingly chooses a very poor story idea for his first mainstream project made with a big name. Plus throughout the film his famous touch is visible only in some characters in the beginning or in few scenes later on with some notable dialogues well rendered by the supporting cast. Further a few insertions are incorporated in a quite unintelligent way (unlike a Dhulia film), like the use of Skype in a confidential meeting straight connecting to the jail, the extreme facilities enjoyed by the power broker within the jail premises and particularly the dialogue mentioning Rani Laxmi Bai in the hotel room (What was it really??).\n\nMoreover the intense emotional feel, visible in the director&apos;s previous films is completely missing in this and the viewers never feel connected to the ongoing affair between the lead pair not even once. Now whether this was a result of the director&apos;s sincere attempt to enter the commercial zone for the first time or the outcome of some external interference in his directorial vision cannot be said. But whatever the reason might be, the truth remains that this happens to be the weakest film of Tigmanshu Dhulia till date unarguably. Apart from its feeble story plot, the other major disappointment of BULLETT RAJA is its poor soundtrack and over use of songs unnecessarily. The background score too sounds both good and average at different places following an uneven path and cinematography could have made a stronger impact with a better editing. Promoted as an action film, the fight sequences do have a realistic feel but the action actually could really have been the key player here with Vidyut coming in earlier since he is the best one to display the art specifically. \n\nRegarding its performances, the film is solely made for Saif alone and he tries hard to fit into the character doing all the home work. Yet, I found a lot missing in his honest portrayal of Raja Misra in terms of energy and that rustic feel, so couldn&apos;t relate to his on screen character frankly. On the other side, Jimmy Sheirgill once again displays his best in a Tigmanshu Dhulia project and holds the film strongly till he is there on the screen forming a fine team with Saif. Here I must add that the actor is a completely different person (arrogant and with a lot of attitude) when it comes to Punjabi films in particular. And Jimmy really needs to see into this difference of attitude at the earliest.\n\nPlaying the female lead, I wonder how on earth Sonakshi manages to act and enjoy the same kind of performance in almost every film of hers in a repetitive mode (except LOOTERA). Perhaps she is more interested in only quantity and not quality. Gulshan Grover &amp; Raj Babbar are fine as usual but both Vipin Sharma and Shart Saxena leave a solid impact in their short roles. Chunky Pandey and Mahile Gill are there for only few scenes in the beginning. However to say the truth, BULLET RAJA would have been an entirely different film altogether with Vidyut Jammwal and Ravi Kissen having more lengthy roles in the script. Particularly Ravi Kissen whose highly interesting character of a cross-dressing man, remains wasted without given much to do. \n\nEnding on a sour note, BULLETT RAJA doesn&apos;t have that thrill, excitement, freshness and honesty associated with the films made by one of the most promising director of our times, Tigmanshu Dhulia. Perhaps this is the cost a visionary director has to pay while working with big production houses and STARS following their specific instructions. So assuming that the makers would learn from their mistake made, I hope Tigmanshu returns back to his own school of film-making soon following his inner urge and gives us another gem in the future, taking BULLETT RAJA out of his system at the earliest.",

      "reviewBody": "Clive Candy (Roger Livesey), a British army officer, wins a Victoria Cross in South Africa, fights a duel in Berlin in 1902, acquires a lifelong friend and his lifelong love for a woman (or women), commands in Flanders in the Great War and brings the experience of a lifetime&apos;s service to the Second World War.\n\nIt is soon apparent that this fine film portrays a Colonel Blimp very different from David Low&apos;s jingoistic and hidebound comic strip character. Here, Candy is a sympathetic figure from the start; firm in his principles, certainly, but courteous and sensitive with those whom he respects - indeed, how could Livesey not appear as a sympathetic character: it seems to be in his very nature.  The film is clever and deceptive in its structure.  The action is framed by the opening WWII exercise, in which the &quot;invaders&quot; capture the elderly General Wynne-Candy.  These scenes are repeated and elaborated at the end of the film, where the effect of the exercise in demonstrating the obsolescence of Candy&apos;s values becomes clear and when he makes clear his great stature in embracing the uncongenial reality that confronts him.  Within this frame, the story of Candy&apos;s life is told, and here is the greater deception, for, at the beginning, it seems like a straightforward romantic comedy, perhaps even disappointing in its lack of ideas.  Then, after the Armistice, the mood changes, becomes philosophical, as the nature of loyalty and friendship, of love and patriotism are explored. \n\nRepresentatives of the British establishment, assembled around a dinner table, assert their resolve to see Germany rebuilt in a fair peace. Credulity is strained here, when one recalls the oppressive reality and disastrous consequences of the Versailles Treaty.  Yet the principles are praiseworthy and would be reflected in the settlement after WWII.  The two defining moments of the film are both given to Candy&apos;s long-time friend, the German uhlan officer, Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff (Anton Walbrook).  He delivers two set-piece speeches, one explaining why he had abandoned Germany for England in 1935, the second a manifesto for the survival of a democracy in total war.  They, like the rest of his performance, are given impeccably and, with their quiet delivery by a German character, intensely moving. \n\n Deborah Kerr, lovely yet brimming with personality, plays superbly her three roles, each a woman Candy loves at different stages in his career and, incidentally, disclosing his character as socially democratic, unlikely but attractive none the less.  Kerr succeeds in subtly differentiating each role, whilst revealing the characteristics that were bound to attract Candy. Both Walbrook and Livesey give outstanding performances, despite ageing forty years, a process Kerr avoids.  John Laurie, as Murdoch, Candy&apos;s batman, has a less outrageous role than those usually assigned to this fine character actor.  Alfred Junge presents his usual excellent design, taking full advantage of Technicolor.\n\nThis film was, supposedly, produced in 1943 as British propaganda.  It is noteworthy that even Churchill could not suppress exhibition of this film when he was concerned at its message.  That message embraces loyalty and steadfastness, honesty, democracy, realism and fairness.  It is about the importance of relationships that transcend nationality.  It is about love, between woman and man, and as a general concept.  It is about being resolute and pragmatic in conflict and generous in victory.  It recognizes the value of individuals beyond the categories in which they find themselves.  If this film can be represented as British propaganda, then no-one need be ashamed to be British.\n\nThis film transcends its format and, perhaps, the intentions with which it was produced.  It is another wonderful surprise from the Archers which everyone should see.",

      "reviewBody": "BLUE MOUNTAINS, OR AN IMPROBABLE STORY (&quot;Why two titles?&quot;) is an absurdist tale in which a novelist takes his latest manuscript to his familiar publishing house, only to have it pushed aside, lost, damaged, stolen, or simply ignored again and again as the employees go about their meaningless, repetitive work. Things start out fairly normal and get gradually stranger as the story continues. As film satires go it&apos;s not quite as cunning as Bunuel&apos;s best work (which it seems it could have been influenced by) but it&apos;s still a funny, sharp and brutally honest jab at the crumbling Soviet government and bureaucratic ineptness in all its forms. Ramaz Giorgobiani&apos;s expressionless lead performance is an interesting and eventually necessary realist counterpoint to the often wild and intentionally bloated performances of the bureaucrats. The aforementioned Bunuel is an obvious cinematic connection, as is Fellini&apos;s ORCHESTRA REHEARSAL, but as I was watching it I kept thinking this is what might happen if Preston Sturges filmed a Kafka story. Well worth a look."

      "name": "Good sequel and once again a portentous acting by the great Alfredo Landa  as the embittered detective Areta",
      "reviewBody": "Splendid film in American ¨Noir¨ style in which Germán Areta (a too serious Alfredo Landa) nicknamed ¨Piojo¨ undertakes another assignment . German in appointed by his old friend Don Ricardo (Jose Bodalo) who gives him a peculiar case . As the bitter as well as stubborn Areta carries out a new investigation , full of topical and ¨Castizo¨ characters who tell about boxing , play ¨Mus¨ cards and go to Madrid cinemas . Private detective Germán Areta gets a mysterious gay client who wishes to investigate his long lost , runaway ex-lover . German once again goes into action to investigate whereabouts a doctor from a pharmaceutical lab . Being helped by Cardenas , alias ¨El Moro¨(Miguel Rellan) , and following his sentimental problems with his ordinary girlfriend , Carmen (Maria Casanova) . But when Germán starts looking into case , strange happenings take place , such as robbing and killing , as someone else is also interested in him , someone powerful and dangerous who will stop at nothing to prevent Areta from knowing the truth. \n\nSecond installment about adventures and misfortunes of sleuth Areta , the most particular private eye of the Spanish cinema . After the successful political-sentimental trilogy formed by ¨Asignatura Pendiente¨(1977) , ¨Solos En Madrugada¨(1978) and ¨Verdes Praderas¨(1979) , director Jose Luis Garci changes genre and shoots this noir film imitating the American style and popular actors as Humphrey Bogart and Robert Mitchum . Here the premise is simple , Areta is assigned by an old gay man to investigate his ex-lover , it leads him to the dark , underbelly of Madrid , he realizes that he is not only one looking for this old homosexual . In spite of slowness , the picture is pretty well , filled with suspense , thrills , emotion and a complex intrigue . Although it contains a weak pace , slow developing and a difficult storyline dealing with homosexuals , chemical laboratories , false medicines , a dark Mafia and many other things . Here Jose Luis Garci and screenwriter Horacio Valcárcel adapt the American Noir to Democratic Spain with an adequate homage to this classic genre . As Garci pays tribute to it , including some frames from ¨The asphalt jungle¨(1950) with Marilyn Monroe and Louis Calhern . The film is dedicated to Raymond Chandler , while the first part ¨The Crack I¨ was dedicated to Dasiell Hammet . The main aspect results to be its excellent cast and stands out Alfredo Landa giving a fabulous performance , including some breathtaking scenes in the beginning when Areta/Landa faces a group of small-time delinquents . Support cast gives nice interpretations such as Maria Casanova as his sweetheart , Miguel Rellán as his helper , Arturo Fernández as a wealthy mobster , Rafael De Penagos as a veteran , higher class gay , José Manuel Cervino as an Inspector Chief , Fernando Bilbao as a corpulent bodyguard and , of course , the great José Bódalo . Most of them played in ¨The crack I¨ adding Manuel Tejada , Francisco Vidal , Raul Freire and Maite Blasco. Enjoyable and appropriate settings by Felix Murcia . Sentimental and repeated musical score by Jesus Gluck , being composed and performed by piano . Colorful cinematography by Manuel Rojas , showing wonderfully the city of Madrid . \n\nThe motion picture was compellingly written (along with his usual collaborator Horacio Valcarcel) , financed (by his production company called Nickel Odeaon S.A.) and directed by Jose Luis Garci , though it was strongly criticized by melodrama trending and a very maudlin soundtrack . Jose Luis knows very well the American Noir genre and here he translates it to the Spanish idiosyncrasy . José Luis Garci is without a doubt one of the most influential film personalities in the history of film in Spain and perhaps the best known writer in the country . Garci won one Academy Award for ¨Volver a Empezar¨. He has left a distinguished talent in his successful movies throughout the years , as writing as shooting , such as : La Cabina (1972) , Las Verdes Praderas (1979), Sesión Continua , Volver a Empezar (1982), Canción De Cuna (1994), La Herida Luminosa (1997), El Abuelo (1998), Tiovivo c. 1950 (2004) , Ninette (2005) , Luz Del Domingo , among others. Rating : Better than average and well worth seeing . For these reasons ¨Crack II¨ is essential and indispensable watching .",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this at the theater when it was released theatrically and I have been a fan ever since. I actually have grown more fond of this film with repeated viewings. Anyways, Priest is a very enjoyable and slick looking comic book styled action/fantasy movie that is a futuristic sci fi vampire western. Combining elements from Blade, Star Wars and the classic western, Priest is awesome and such delivers big time in the butt kicking department. This is set in a futuristic parallel universe where humans and vampires are engaged in an eternal war and battle for domination. In this retro futuristic society, the church runs the show and as such religion, government and industry are one. The vampires are faster and more agile then humans and humanity&apos;s only advantage is the sun. They are blind, insect like monsters that are vicious cgi critters that the priests must fight off with their special vatican style of kung fu. Priests are highly skilled holy warriors, similar to jedi knights, except their power comes not from the force, but the big man upstairs. This is done pretty well and the acting and storytelling are solid. Paul Bettany was excellent as the lead here, his delivery on his character is heavily influenced by Clint Eastwood and he pulls it off quite well without it coming off forced or cheesy. Bettany does well as action hero and is accompanied by Maggie Q, Christopher Plummer and Karl Urban as villain. As a whole I found this quite enjoyable and even though I much favor practical f/x, this is a total cgi fest. Even with that as a factor, the film comes off as a pretty fresh take on the vampire genre with great action and is well executed overall. Even though this is a PG 13 action film, the film is pretty violent considering and is much darker in tone than most PG 13 fare. Although, Priest plays as pretty unique it is not afraid to wear its influences on its sleeve and if you are a fan of westerns, Blade and Star Wars, Priest is the movie for for you and in my opinion Priest is much better than the Star Wars prequels.",

      "reviewBody": "In surely one of his lightest and straight-forward works of his career, Clint Eastwood has achieved one of the most inspirational films of the year with his new film, Invictus.\n\nStarring Academy Award Winners Morgan Freeman as South African President Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Rugby Captain Francois Pienaar, Invictus is a picture full of emotion, magnetism, and revelation. What critics and audiences may be deceived by is belief that this is THE Nelson Mandela biopic which it is not. It is the story of Nelson Mandela&apos;s first years as President of the culturally separated country South Africa in 90&apos;s. In a way to unify his people, Mandela used the country&apos;s love for Rugby to connect the whites and the blacks. As their record has been less than impressive, no one expects anything notable from the Springboks. Mandela taps the captain of the team to rally his troops and surge into battle for the greater good of his country.\n\nEverything about Invictus works on so many degrees of the medium based on the book &quot;Playing the Enemy.&quot; The film never comes off as too pretentious or egotistical; it requires nothing more from the viewer than an open mind and heart. Eastwood directs the film perfectly, laying back when he needs to, never pushing the subject matter or shoving it down our throats. He utilizes all the skills we&apos;ve come to love about his earlier works in Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, and Letters from Iwo Jima. The use of light shows a character&apos; s vulnerability inhabiting their souls or a score by Kyle Eastwood that offers both zeal and subtlety during a rugby match. \n\nCinematographer Tom Stern hits another one out of the park, catching all the fury and apprehension of all the different elements of this strenuous time. Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film with the perfect amount of precision and friction. \n\nMorgan Freeman as Mandela is a wonderful charmer, showing the man&apos;s most hostile yet tranquil behaviors. Not necessarily the most engulfed characterization seen on film this year as Freeman&apos;s accent comes in and out of remission, but it&apos;s a tremendous performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. \n\nMatt Damon, showing himself as one of the best working actors today, doesn&apos;t have enough of the character depth and arc to carry the picture. Damon&apos;s performance doesn&apos;t allow him to really go anywhere. It&apos;s a superb turn, with a great accent inhabitance, that warrants credit where the credit is due. However, Damon requires nothing more than a little motivational speaking and responsive humility.\n\nInvictus, is one of the best pictures of the year, standing in the ranks of one of the best sports films of the decade. This is the type of film that Oscar will likely be all over and fall in love with. I concur. \n\n****/****",

How to keep track of all if them? This is not the video nastie titled Boogeyman II or Revenge of the Boogeyman as an alternate title. This is the &quot;hot young stars of the WB&quot; version.\n\nIt stars Danielle Savre of such shows as &quot;Grounded for Life&quot; and &quot;Summerland.&quot; She did her first real movie the same time as this where she was &quot;Teenage Girl #2.&quot; She did a good job here and I was really impressed with her potential in the genre.\n\nThe other characters come from such shows as &quot;South of Nowhere,&quot; &quot;State of Grace,&quot; &quot;American Dragon: Jake Long&quot;, or &quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot; I only mention all these shows as I have not seen one of them. This was a characterless movie with the exception of Tobin Bell, who did this in between Saw II and IV. His character played a small, but important role, and he did a good job.\n\nThe movie&apos;s rating is based upon the action. The use of fears to torture is reminiscent of 1984, and worked effectively. I really was watching for what came next and overlooked many of the flaws the movie had as they really didn&apos;t detract from the action. I was especially taken with the ending. Good job there.\n\nWorth seeing even if these &quot;stars&quot; are unfamiliar.",

It&apos;s just that in here, it give a more scientific (yet easy to understand) approach to the series&apos; overseas (in many ways) origin and climax, and also shows that, as cheesy as it sounds, love conquers all. It is a little slow at first, but there are things that keep your interest, so yes, it really is a good watch, even if you&apos;re not a fan of the game, or didn&apos;t know it was a game at all. It&apos;s a rare find, but it&apos;s worth a try even once :)"

      "reviewBody": "Comedy. I stumbled upon this French comedy purely by accident, then read some reviews, which were already very captivating with the sincerity of emotions and the excellent acting of the comedian Louis de Funes. And I decided to personally check it out - and did not regret this decision, and here is my brief opinion - How to punish a greedy banker. I did not notice the minuses in the picture, although I tried to find them with the zeal of a religious fanatic, so let your humble servant focus your attention on the merits of this comedy. So, here they are: 1. Scenario - Monsieur Garnier, the father of a large family and the owner of the &quot;Hunting and Fishing&quot; store, lived in the world and wanted to invest his savings in a good and &quot;true&quot; business. To do this, he went to the bank opposite his store and, on the advice of the owner of the bank, Monsieur Durand-Marey, invested in a company. As a result, I lost all my money. Driven by righteous anger, well, financial difficulties, he decides to rob, involving the whole family. The picture is a robbery, which means there will be many funny and unusual situations, pleasant humor and charisma of Louis de Funes. Of course, there will be scenario twists and charismatic characters. And the finale will pleasantly surprise you, and make you watch the picture from beginning to end. I myself watched with great pleasure what was happening on the screen. If you love a similar genre of crime comedy: &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot;, &quot;Gambit&quot;, &quot;Big Jackpot&quot; and so on, then you should not turn away from this comedy! 2. Humor - I must warn you in advance that do not count on wild laughter, but funny situations, funny antics and a lot of palms attached to the head from the bacchanalia taking place on the screen are provided to you. Personally, I hoped to laugh heartily, but I managed to realize this only partially. In the local humor there is no vulgarity, vulgarity, and indeed &quot;dirt&quot;, so you can watch the whole family. 3. Music - the famous French composer Paul Mauriat was responsible for it (whose music I just adore and regularly insert into my reviews). Well, here the music is funny, sometimes dramatic, but always light and relaxed, which immerses the viewer in what is happening on the screen. 4. Acting - everyone coped with their roles a little more than completely. It seems to me that the actors not only did their work, but even had time to have fun on the set of this picture. Everyone did a great job and no one raises any complaints. And the characters are quite colorful, although some have nothing in the picture of screen time. A little about the main characters: 1. Victor Garnier, performed by Louis de Funes, is an honest and respected businessman and owner of a small shop who was deceived by his neighbor banker, and now it is time for revenge. Louis de Funes is a cult in France, for and in Russia and the countries of the former USSR too. And if I didn&apos;t like the &quot;Gendarme of Saint-Tropez&quot; (for it is boring and not funny), then this is another matter. Almost the whole picture rests on the charisma and antics of Louis. His crazy ideas cause laughter, and their implementation - even more laughter. He perfectly played the role of the father of the family and the leader of the family gang. Bravo Louis! 2. André Durand-Marey performed by Jean-Pierre Mariel - the owner of the bank, who profited from the honesty of Monsieur Garnier and many other people. He does not deny himself anything and boasts of his position and money. Typical &quot;business shark&quot; who rowed everything for himself and only himself. Nevertheless, you will not deny him in mind. Jean-Pierre perfectly played the main villain and scoundrel, whom you despise with all your heart. 3. Philippe Brecy performed by Jean Valmont - a bank employee who fell in love with the daughter of Monsieur Garnier. An honest and humble young man who has a role to play in the upcoming events. Jean was very convincing in this role. This comedy is not a masterpiece, but it deserves a quality four. To while away the evening with her is a great option! As a result, we have a good comedy about a robbery, with a good and strong script, great music, high-quality humor, charismatic characters, and great acting. My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",

      "reviewBody": "The first time I rented this movie, it seemed a bit annoying because of all the arguing, etc., but it entertained me enough to give it a second look and I ended up buying it.  It speaks to the need in all human beings to love and be loved and all those weird things we say and do to somehow keep it from happening to us.  I felt like I was in the front row of an off-broadway play and admired the characters so much for having to learn all that dialogue and have no other actors to share the load. My favorite scene is the middle of the night at Monica&apos;s place when Steve is quietly trying to leave and the ensuing conversation they have.   The very last scene was open to the viewer&apos;s own feeling -  we know they were each other&apos;s one true love but we had to decide what their future held (Personally, I think they ran in to each other in New York - in a taxi - after their children had grown and their first marriages were over and lived happily ever after  - unmarried, of course!) Great acting by Salma Hayak and Russell Crowe.\n\n A few technical flaws along the way, but all in all the way the music played with the scenes, a good dose of humor, and the realistic love scenes pretty much rounded out the on again/off again true love relationship Monica &amp; Steve aspired to.   *** out of ****"

Anna Faris, better known as the innocent Cindy Campbell from the Scary Movies franchise, plays Jane, who gets real stoned and has lots of important stuff to do.\n\nThe plot sounded nice from the beginning, but I wasn&apos;t expecting it to be so artistic. It&apos;s more of an adventure film rather than a comedy. It&apos;s something like... stoner adventure. Anyway, lots of funny moments here, great to watch when you yourself are stoned. Has an unexpected ending and oh, those situations... Haven&apos;t we all been there? \n\nPlus, good soundtrack. Watch it with your friends."

The camera is very fluid in this otherwise ordinary adaptation of Shakespeare&apos;s play.\n\nHollywood royalty Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford star as Kate and Petruchio, the warring couple who really love each other on the sly. Their marriage was a sham by the time this flick came out, and both their careers were on the wane, but they give reasonable enough performances, even though Fairbanks looks a few years too old for his part when the camera gets close. There&apos;s still a tendency to exaggerate their gestures and overact to responses to words being spoken, but they&apos;re no worse than any other stars making their first sound films.\n\nIt&apos;s clear that Hollywood back then had no more confidence in the intelligence of its audience than it does today: this is Shakespeare for the common man, with the pith of the Bard&apos;s prose removed in order to make the words readily understandable to all. Although the film is little more than an hour long, it does begin to drag during the last twenty minutes but, that aside, it&apos;s not a bad effort.",

      "reviewBody": "Ruth Leuwerik and Dieter Borsche in a solid literary adaptation\n\nNone other than Nobel Prize winner for literature Thomas Mann (1875-1955) wrote his novel as the basis for this sweet and cute film by Harald Braun. The Film-Aufbau Göttingen shot primarily in Fulda and at the Nienover hunting lodge (near Bodenfelde), great locations that give the story even more splendor. Oh yes, daughter Erika Mann plays a small role and also co-wrote the script. And the film also ran in competition at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nPrince Klaus Heinrich (Dieter Borsche) is the head of a completely impoverished Grand Duchy and no longer knows what to do given the enormous debt burden. A rich American (Heinz Hilpert) comes to visit with his beautiful daughter Imma (Ruth Leuwerik) and actually wants to buy the castle... Of course, there are more complications until the end in happiness is finally deserved.\n\nThis film lives from the beautiful color shots and the great actors. Lil Dagover plays a somewhat crazy countess, Paul Henckels and Günther Lüders can be seen in other roles. And Ruth Leuwerik and Dieter Borsche became the dream couple of the West German film industry. It is also interesting that Heinz Hilpert was the director of the Deutsches Theater in Göttingen at the time. His directorship is still considered to be the heyday of the theater there.\n\nA wonderful pleasure! Pure nostalgia!",

You literally cannot move without bumping into a character/symbol and as usually occurs when humans stand for abstractions like The Military, The Church, or Moral Squalor, they lose whatever quirks and contradictions make them interestingly human and instead, as happens here, become stiff, posturing caricatures.\n\nI will say, however, that director Carlos Saura&apos;s idea of wrapping his condemnation of Francoist Spain in a feminist package, so to speak, where hatred of and desire to dominate women is the engine that drives the whole corrupt enterprise, is an inspired one and gives this film a force that cannot be denied, so that the ending is more shattering than simply over the top.

While this proved to be nothing more than a spin-off grasping at straws, at least no one completely embarrassed themselves. Also, where the heck was Ralph Macchio! Couldn&apos;t he have made a guest appearance. It&apos;s not like he had anything to do at the time.",

A rework of the classic Romeo and Juliet impossible-love scenario, it managed to stand out from the crowd, not least because of the impressive cinematography (helped in no small part by the wonderful locales and the beautiful tribes people (The Iban). While never being earth-shattering, for a film to watch with a loved one (without being too girly) this is hard to top IMO. It shows the moral struggle of a man who has to choose between &apos;duty&apos; and love. The arrogance and conditioning of British colonialism is dealt with well, as we struggled to impose our European values and God on peoples in far flung corners, and indeed it shows the irony that we struggled to retain it ourselves as the beauty of the place and people intoxicated our men (a few cads apart)\n\nWatch it with wifey/girlfriend/prospective mate",

The matte shots creating the colossal effect are badly dated but then these were well before computerized effects. Seems our adventurous foursome have gone looking for Susan&apos;s true love who&apos;s disappeared on a plane flight into the Mexico wilds. Unfortunately for them, but good for us, radioactive uranium deposits saturate the search area. Thus, in typical 50&apos;s fashion, monsters are created out of ordinary critters. Actually the oversized lizards are pretty well done without the obvious matte marks that surround Cyclops. Then too, the small cast does a professional job, without mocking their parts--- something of a surprise for the often hammy Chaney Jr. Of course, I&apos;ll watch anything with cat-eyed Gloria Talbott, especially when she&apos;s in tight pants and top. The actress had a rather brief movie career, mainly in horror features of this type where her exotic features fit in perfectly. And, surprise, surprise, 50&apos;s audiences get yet one more look at Bronson Canyon, without which I doubt the monster genre would have happened. Still, the LA area locations are well framed, including The LA Arboretum used for jungle shots instead of the usual shaky studio sets. All in all, it&apos;s competent drive-in fare that&apos;s more shrewdly done than most."

      "reviewBody": "An absolutely awesome movie, Buddy takes the audience into the lives of three guys in a flat who end up on television with convoluted consequences. Their lives will never be the same, and only the discovery of true loyalty and redemptive friendship can make the situation and experiences into something positive.  The transformation is quite moving and the characters seem very real, everyday people.  Equally interesting, the film crosses documentary with cinema story to interface and comment on &quot;reality TV.&quot; Kudos. \n\nIn spite of the seeming capitulation to Hollywood-style romance and happy endings - very uncharacteristic of Norwegian films - this is an outstanding story about status, using people, allegiance to success and stardom vs. allegiance to caring for human beings, especially friends.  &quot;Buddy&quot; goes through somewhat annoying yo-yo relationships that need more definition and less reliance on fickle happenstance.  The choices are not black and white, and the characters struggle in them.  The topical relevance (to &apos;reality&apos; TV) is especially poignant.  In spite of the over-emphasis on finding romance and happiness in loyalty and responsibility, I give it 9/10.  One of the most provocative, &quot;real&quot; yet uplifting European films of the year. Worth watching multiple times.",

Like the Alien movies.\n\nOf course, it didn&apos;t hurt that Kylie&apos;s good looking too. The plot was interesting. I won&apos;t divulge the rest of the movie, but suffice it to say, if someone likes adventure and science fiction together, this movie might fill the bill. If you find it at your local video store, I would suggest buying it and adding it to your collection.\n\nMy summary is that it&apos;s a better than average film. I recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, you know you make friends and any good friend you don&apos;t abandon, no matter what. \n\nWe get old, things change. We relax into what we still imagine is risky adventure. And in friends we don&apos;t point out the reality that what might have been important then, isn&apos;t now. \n\nHerzog is a friend, a good one. I&apos;ve trusted him in the past and when he&apos;s let me down it has been honorably. So I&apos;ll come to anything he makes, even though I know sometimes I&apos;ll have to make excuses for him.\n\nAnd that&apos;s what I have to do here, apologize, justify.\n\nWhen Herzog approaches a project, you can see that it has only one conceptual thrust. Just one. That&apos;s been fine for me because he takes that one idea  whatever it is  to such extremes with such honesty and commitment it blossoms into levels that resonate.\n\nThe idea here is similar to one he has explored before: the images don&apos;t matter, anything can be used, even stock images. The story doesn&apos;t matter at all; any tripe can suffice, the more generic the better. There need be no point, no message, no root into your soul, or the group soul.\n\nAll we need is aeolian sound, edited in a way that corresponds in an obvious way with splashes of color. Its the rhythm of the thing, established aurally and only then visually, with the visual pace lagging. Its a way of letting us know that anyone who does this can impart religion of any content.\n\nThroughout is a supposedly wised up guy constantly reminding us that he could have told us so.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

      "reviewBody": "After all the delay this film suffered I finally got around to seeing Lucky McKee&apos;s second movie. His first, &apos;May&apos;, was weird but brilliant horror with some genuine shock moments. The Woods doesn&apos;t disappoint in either department. The film is set in 1965 and centres around Heather Fasulo (Agnes Bruckner) who is sent to an all-girl boarding school in the middle of the woods. Right from the start she suspects that something is different about the school and it doesn&apos;t help the teachers are all a tad weird, especially Headmistress Traverse (Patricia Clarkson). Her suspicion is raised when the girls at the school tell her the story of three witches who took over the school 100 years ago.\n\nMcKee&apos;s influences are obvious. From cult favourite &apos;The Evil Dead&apos;, Dario Argento&apos;s masterpiece &apos;Suspiria&apos; and the supernatural Stephen King adaptation of &apos;Carrie.&apos; He blends all these into an original little horror that is effective and interesting from start to finish. The first hour is actually very slow paced and in terms of horror there isn&apos;t a whole lot. That&apos;s not a bad thing, however, as it allows McKee to create a mystery around the central theme and develop the characters nicely. The last 20 minutes take a different stance, with gore galore and a neat twist which wraps up the movie nicely. The acting is good from all, Agnes Bruckner carries the movie well, Patricia Clarkson is subtle as the villain and Bruce Campbell makes a cool cameo. All in all &apos;The Woods&apos; is a fine horror and I eagerly await McKee&apos;s next movie! 4/5",

This flick was supposed to be lost forever but as with so many lost flick suddenly someone popped up with a bad copy. It&apos;s now restored and is in fact watchable. On the other hand while being screened at movie theaters a woman got a heart attack so it really became a well sought flick.\n\nIt&apos;s loosely based on Bram Stoker&apos;s story, it do has a girl being bitten by Dracula and it do has the famous sentence about the children of the night but that&apos;s it. typical for those kind of flicks it do has a few songs in it were they do dance on. There&apos;s no blood to mention, well, maybe one shot where the girl do has blood running from her mouth but it&apos;s done really cheesy. It&apos;s just added with make-up.\n\nIt takes around 100 minutes and that&apos;s too long for such a lame flick. If you want to see how Pakistan made a horror then this is a perfect example. You will see how they do things to avoid blood and nudity. And the acting was really unbelievable bad. Just watch the fighting at the end, baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad acting. And also see the audio equipment making shadows on the wall. Only for the geeks of bad flicks. But coming from Pakistan worth entering your collection just for the sake to say, I have a Pakistanese flick, although there are better ones.\n\nGore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 0/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",

      "reviewBody": "When Enzo G. Castellari and Franco Nero made &quot;Keoma&quot; in 1976, the Spaghetti Western genre was already well passed its glory days, and yet it was a fantastic film; - perhaps one of the best in its kind. When Castellari and Nero got back together in 1995 for &quot;Jonathan and the Bears&quot;, the Spaghetti Western genre was even completely extinct, and they still delivered a great film! Speaking of which, I remember seeing this film in my local video store in the 90s and it had the title &quot;Keoma II&quot;. It&apos;s not a sequel, although there are quite a few similarities. The director and lead star, obviously, but both films also have a distinct and dedicated soundtrack, and they both revolve a lone warrior fighting against injustice.\n\nAs a cherubic blond boy, Jonathan witnesses the brutal execution of his parents. Alone in the woods, he befriends a bear cub and eventually finds a home in an Indian tribe. As an adult, he helps to protect the Indian village against the white men coming to drill for oil. Because the white man comes to kill. The white man ALWAYS comes to kill.\n\n&quot;Jonathan of the Bears&quot; is a great and action-packed western, with the right balance of sentiment versus cruel violence. Franco Nero is a fabulous hero, but this story particularly features a long list of awesome villains! Of all the stone-cold and merciless scoundrels John Saxon depicted in his career, and they are plenty, his character here is definitely one of the evilest. He&apos;s also surrounded by unhinged henchmen (like a religious freak) and random psychopaths, like David Hess and Rodrigo Obregon.\n\nThe film is almost half a musical as well, with a lot of great anthems sung by an actual bard on the screen (Clive Riche), which is a very original aspect in &quot;Jonathan of the Bears&quot;. Castellari also experiments with unique camera angles, the sequences with the bears are deeply impressive, and really a lot of people spectacularly fall dead in the mud. Awesome, awesome film...shamefully undervalued!",

      "reviewBody": "It could be said that The Grand Dual is merely a vehicle for its lead star, and whoever said it wouldn&apos;t necessarily be wrong; but while this film doesn&apos;t feature a lot of originality, it&apos;s also true that Italian cinema was based on repeating itself, and the film definitely succeeds in providing an enjoyable slice of western action. The script was penned by Giallo supremo Ernesto Gastaldi (The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh, The Case of the Bloody Iris), and that&apos;s not surprising as there are shades of Giallo throughout, and the film works both as both as a violent action flick and an intriguing mystery film. The plot focuses on Sheriff Clayton as he becomes involved in the murder of a man so-called &apos;The Patriarch&apos; through his association with the sly Philipp Wermeer. The film follows the pair as they make their way through bandits and bounty hunters and eventually end up in Saxon town, where the sons of the Patriarch live. They&apos;ve fingered Wermeer as the murderer of their father, and naturally want him hanged; but there&apos;s a twist to the identity of the murderer.\n\nLee Van Cleef made his name with Sergio Leone and the masterpiece westerns &apos;For a Few Dollars More&apos; and, of course, &apos;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&apos;. This film is nowhere near the quality of those two, but Van Cleef does well in his &apos;man in black role&apos;, which is a variation on the common western &apos;loner&apos; theme, which was made famous by the likes of Clint Eastwood and Django. Van Cleef&apos;s presence is felt throughout, and he continually makes every scene his own. As you might expect, the rest of the cast don&apos;t live up to the central star; but even so, The Grand Dual features a good ensemble cast, and Peter O&apos;Brien does especially well in his central role. The film features a lot of shootouts and chases on horseback, which are always good to see; but at times, The Grand Dual puts too much focus on entertainment value and this can mean that the plot suffers. Even so, the story plays out well; and the final twist is a real standout, as even though it&apos;s pretty obvious throughout - Gastaldi manages to throw in a twist just before it, which makes the final twist come as a surprise. Overall, this film isn&apos;t one of the great Spaghetti westerns - but it&apos;s a good one and comes recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s 1977 and Stella Vlaminck begins her first year in a prestigious Parisian secondary school. Home for her is a boisterous working class café on the edge of Paris. This is a chance. Can she make it? That&apos;s the premise of this buoyant, touching autobiographical film by Sylvie Verheyde, which has to be one of the best movies made from the point of view of a pre-teen girl. It&apos;s on a par with Julie Gavras&apos;s very fine young girl&apos;s political biography, Blame It on Fidel, and depicts its family with the same unwavering eye.\n\nTo understand why this is such a terrific movie, begin with Lóra Barbara, the young actress who plays Stella, who&apos;s superb. Sometimes she&apos;s plain. Sometimes she&apos;s lovely. Sometimes she seems tiny. Sometimes she&apos;s big. Always, she&apos;s present. And she narrates (a device that&apos;s seamless and delicate, guiding us often but never intruding).\n\nThe essence of the story is that though Stella happens to find her one friend in Gladys (Melisa Rodrigues), a more middle-class girl from an intellectual Argentinian Jewish family, and Gladys is the best student in her class, Stella finds out she doesn&apos;t know a lot of things she needs to know. She knows about pinball and cards and pop music and TV and football and how a bar is run. European history and Greek mythology, Balzac and Cocteau are a mystery to her. And at first she doesn&apos;t care, and she comes home with all F&apos;s. Her father (played charismatically by cool singer-songwriter Benjamin Biolay) is sexy, and well-liked and her mom (Karole Rocher) runs the café and is good looking. They&apos;re &quot;stars&quot; in the neighborhood. But she&apos;s angry and sad and is two-timing him with one of the regulars, and dad drinks too much and is weak. Her older brother Loïc (Johan Libereau) tries to help, but can&apos;t. Very kind to Stella is another local, Bubu (Jeannick Gravelines), but his motives turn out to be ugly indeed.\n\nUnder Gladys&apos; influence, Stella begins to read. Marguerite Duras and Balzac become her friends. But they don&apos;t yet help her in French class, where the teacher finds her spelling utterly pathetic.\n\nLife at the café is entertaining to come home to. And there&apos;s Alain-Bernard (Guillaume Depardieu, sadly, dead four months ago at 37), the kind, charismatic regular Stella&apos;s got a crush on. She plays cards, and is good. She plays the pinball machine with Alain-Bernard too. There&apos;s always something going on. It&apos;s fun, but it&apos;s chaotic, and it distracts Stella from studying, or keeps her from going early to bed. There is TV to watch (Gladys&apos; family don&apos;t have one; they&apos;re &quot;against&quot; it). Sometimes the working-class patrons seem more childish than the bourgeois kids at the school, whose teachers are imperious and demanding gatekeepers of French high culture. This is a contrast to the present-day &apos;banlieue&apos; school depicted so accurately in Cantet&apos;s recent prizewinner, The Class. No teacher is going to bend to Stella. Some of the teachers are abusive and throw tantrums--or throw a kid&apos;s stuff out the window.\n\nIn the summer Stella&apos;s parents dump her off somewhere in the country with her grandmother, her father&apos;s mother, who steals from the till when she visits them in Paris. At school, Stella&apos;s a hick, a nothing, not too smart and not too cool. In the country, she&apos;s &quot;rich,&quot; because from Paris. But here too she&apos;s a misfit because her only friend is a girl with a retarded brother and a nasty scary alcoholic dad, Genvieve (Laetitia Guerard), who herself is shunned by most of the other kids in the northern French village.\n\nVerheyde shows a masterly ability to film all these milieus and make them seem like it&apos;s just happening and the camera&apos;s a fly on the wall. The cinematography by Nicolas Gaurin is light as a feather. This filmmaker creates a turbulent world, yet knows how to stop and let her story breathe. There were many moments that reminded me why I love French cinema.\n\nStella opened November 12, 2008 in Paris to excellent reviews. There&apos;s not much you can say against this film, though some thought the screenplay ought to have been less episodic. Shown as part of the Rendez-Vous at Lincoln Center March 2009. No US distributor, but this is highly recommended. 103 minutes.",

It&apos;s definitely a movie that you&apos;ve got to be in the mind for but it is funny, the music has the characteristic Carpenter style, is very hippyish in a lot of ways and the low-budget style works very well. The alien is great - apparently its feet are the ones used in &quot;The Creature From The Black Lagoon&quot;\n\nIt&apos;s a shame the DVD doesn&apos;t have any extras. I suppose there isn&apos;t much left lying around for them to use!\n\nIt&apos;s also incredible to think that it was only 5 years between the release of this and the release of Alien. Pinback is one of the characters in Dark Star, played by Dan O&apos;Bannon and he is also the co-writer. Then he went on to write Alien!\n\nDo see this film - but be in a laid-back mood when you do."

      "reviewBody": "This film certainly is very important for dealing with Swiss history, and it is important that it shows much about life of those victims of the mid-century European racism whose voices are not so often heard. The film certainly makes an important contribution towards seeing the past in a less distorted way.\n\nBut, just because the subject is so important, it is a real pity that the film is artistically so bad. It is just a repetition of the same thing over and over, and at some point it just stops. The recurrence of the same thing is not reflected upon in any way, and much of the challenge the story offers is lost in the tedious flow of the simple narrative. Further, I understand that emotions are very important in films, but when there is just a mother crying for minutes when her child is taken away and no attempt at all to convey emotions in a more complex way, this is a pity. I think this film is typical of films from German-speaking Switzerland: There are very good intentions, but a lack of artistical capabilities and expertise. How much better would it have been if the film wasn&apos;t only about a subject everyone in Switzerland should think about, but also had real artistic qualities. Then, it would also have served the aim of preventing people from forgetting the dark sides of the past much better.",

      "name": "A search for and finding one&apos;s roots at Christmas time",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Christmas Child&quot; doesn&apos;t fit in the usual uplifting and romantic type of stories that are so popular over the Christmas holidays. But this film is quite good. It does have a sub-theme that looks at the origin and real meaning of Christmas. And that is seen through a main plot of finding family and discovery of one&apos;s roots. While it may not appeal to some people, I think this film will be very meaningful to those who have been adopted, or who have adopted children themselves or had to give up a child for adoption. That would be several million in North America alone, and as many in Europe and perhaps other areas. Most people grow up with their biological mom, or dad, or both. So, they don&apos;t ask where they came from or who their parents were. But, for those of us who have been adopted, it&apos;s quite different. It&apos;s a natural thing to wonder about who a mom or dad or parents were and to want to find out something about them.\n\nThis film treats this subject in a very good way. I rate it highly for that reason. And it would rate still higher but for one main character who is not essential to the story, and for some aspects of the script and film that are distractions, or that don&apos;t fit well or make much sense.\n\nI won&apos;t give the story away, but will note these few points and shortcomings. William Moses gives a mostly superb portrayal of Jack Davenport. But, in the opening scenes, it&apos;s not quite clear why his relationship seems so cold with his wife, Meg, played by Megan Follows. One can&apos;t help thinking that love has gone out of their lives - that he no longer loves Meg. Jack has been grieving his adopted father&apos;s death nine months earlier, Now he is curious about his blood parents when he finds a photo and keepsake items in his dad&apos;s safety deposit box. But why should this make him is so cool toward his wife? Not once when they talk on the phone and he calls her from Texas, does he say that he loves her. Was an intentional aspect of the film - to have viewers think there was no longer love there and their marriage was falling apart? It&apos;s a further distraction that could easily have been eliminated just by Jack telling Meg at the end of one or two phone calls, that he loves her. That would further drive home the notion that something else is bothering Jack deeply.\n\nFinally, I could see no purposes whatsoever in the character of the sheriff, Jimmy-James, played by Muse Watson. If anything, his inclusion and Jack&apos;s interplay with him act like red herrings to the story. They have nothing to do with the plot. Instead, this gives a negative drift to the film. Was it intended to portray a southern red-neck sheriff who resents a city-sicker coming to town? Especially one from up North? Because that&apos;s sure what it looks like. Now, the sheriff wasn&apos;t crass or crude or bombastic in anyway. He was rather calm and cool. But he had nothing better to do in the town than watch, pursue and nitpick with a pleasant journalist from out of town? There is one hint that Jimmy-James&apos;s harassing streak comes from jealousy. When Jack first goes into Kirby&apos;s Café to look over the pictures taken by the late Rev. Krause, and the waitress, Cindy, pays more attention to him than to Jimmy-James, the sheriff flashes an ornery look on his face.\n\nBut, again, all the incidents with the sheriff and Jack after that don&apos;t fit the story overall, and they detract more than they help the story. If anything, they paint Jack as something of a dummy. One doesn&apos;t challenge a law officer who&apos;s doing his job, however picayunish it may seem. And, the sheriff&apos;s hounding Jack makes him to look like a red-neck with nothing better to do. Everything of substance about this story could be told and more meaningfully, with the sheriff&apos;s character eliminated entirely - or changed to eliminate the disputes.\n\nThe movie was filmed in Okmulgee, Oklahoma, as the fictional town of Clearwater, Texas. The street scenes clearly show a small town of the range of 10,000 or so population. Such towns usually have a few churches, not just one community church. There is a line by Jack late in the film that refers to other churches in the town. That makes it a little odd that all the people that Jack meets in this story would be members of or attend this one church. And, for the annual Christmas Eve program at the nearly life-sized hand carved nativity scene, the gathering doesn&apos;t seem very large if the nativity scene is the pride of the community. One other small goof in the script is when Jack is invited to the celebration at Stafford&apos;s barn. He doesn&apos;t ask for directions, and the person doesn&apos;t tell him how to find it\n\nThis movie is based on a short story by Max Lucado, &quot;The Christmas Cross.&quot; He revised it in 2003 and changed the title to &quot;The Christmas Child: A Story of Coming Home.&quot; The film has a very good ending that fits perfectly with the themes of family and Christmas. Here are a couple of lines from the film\n\nDan, the helper in the church, &quot;Christmas Eve. Special service. You plannin&apos; on comin?&quot; Jack Davenport, &quot;I&apos;ll think about it.&quot; Dan, &quot;It&apos;s a good thing God didn&apos;t think about it. He did it. He came. Now, that&apos;s somethin&apos; to think about.&quot;\n\nJudge, &quot;I figure he worked 10 years carving this nativity scene.&quot;",

The result is very watchable.\n\nAs a bonus, we get to see parts of beautiful Budapest.\n\nMy only regret is that the resolution is too much of a Deus ex machina for my taste.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the points made by the movie is that Alida&apos;s life had been so self-centered and dry so far, that she had driven away all the people who had loved her in the distant past.",

The story of two young men during the Nazi suppression; and that of a man and a married woman; two relations both of which are considered highly immoral in their respective environments.\n\nThrough the flashbacks, we are taken back to how love finds a way in a country under occupation and we see how the young woman sees her own love&apos;s fate in the old man&apos;s sad story.\n\nWorth seeing, and seeing again.",

      "reviewBody": "There are many reasons why we like a movie or not. For me, this is the case in witch small things were enough to like it: the two main actors, the places in which the action occurs, and the fact that it has more to do with a love affair, in a tragic atmosphere than about spies. Well, of course this is about spies - two of them - and mostly about the relation between them; if they are similar enough to understand each other, they are also different enough to generate some tension in the relation. \n\nMaybe this is more about how the characters move around each others than about action or intrigue. In fact this is so obvious that the way in which the story is told is mostly in flashback, with Muir (Robert Redford) introducing all of them and narrating part. So, the story is the story and the spy game is what Muir does within the CIA, in 24 hours or so. The distinction is important because if you think of this as a traditional spy movie (maybe like the Bourne Identity or Supremacy) it has two obvious flaws for the genre: the plot is very simple (maybe predictable) and there&apos;s no bad guy, no one to kill or to revenge; there&apos;s also almost no genuine action, and, as far as I can remember, Bishop (Brad Pitt) only fires one weapon in the whole movie. Maybe what mislead most of the people was the title of the movie, and maybe that&apos;s why most of them didn&apos;t like it. However, in my opinion, this is a very good movie, with strong leading roles and a compelling story. \n\nNo gadgets, no arms, no villains, no action...oh, no,this is a whole different game, and it&apos;s a serious and a dangerous game: the game of people and their relations.",

The movie is weak and although it&apos;s not awful, it&apos;s so mediocre and on that fine line, that you might as well say it&apos;s bad. It&apos;s the weakest of all the Xmen movies and then X3 after that.\n\nThe previous movies alluded to the idea that Wolverine was barely holding back his more intense rages. That struggle is what makes him so compelling - that with just one slip up he&apos;d be more animal than man. So what I wanted from Origins was that crazy Wolverine that the current day guy was afraid of. Instead they presented a pretty levelheaded guy who just liked to fight, but not that much.\n\nAlso, they totally botched the purpose of the Weapon X stuff. Namelythe purpose of the program is to subjugate mutants by treating them like objects, not people. So even if they wanted to go with the whole &quot;level headed Canadian&quot; for the first part of the movie, he should have been turned into that crazy, out-of-control animal after Weapon X. This way I could see his humanity stripped away, revealing the animal inside, and thus showing me why he&apos;s afraid that it&apos;ll get out again.\n\nAlas, his response to volunteering for the program is more of a casual confusion at his new, sharper claws. Basically, they missed the point of the character.",

      "name": "Fairly meandering and aimless but quite inoffensive and certainly not as bad as it looked in it&apos;s trailers",
      "reviewBody": "Frank Quinlan and Huey Driscoll are reporters for a trashy tabloid paper who are on a bad run of bad stories. When their editor lays down an ultimatum to them, they bring him a potentially great story  a real life angel. They are accompanied by a supposed angel expert, Dorothy Winters who has really been sent to keep an eye on the reporters for editor Vartan Malt. When they arrive they find the &apos;angel&apos; to appear to be genuine but to be a lot less, well, angelic than they expected him to be  smoking, drinking and womanising. Michael agrees to go back to Chicago and be in the papers but only if they can travel back by road and make stops along the way. As Michael gets his traveling companions in and out of trouble it begins to seem that he may actually have a bigger aim to achieve than just getting into the papers.\n\nIn the UK it is not the &apos;done thing&apos; to cheer, clap or deride films or trailers in a very public way in the same manner as US audiences will do as the norm (my first time in a US cinema was a surprise when the audience applauded), but it is the reason I will always remember this film. When the trailer was shown in the UK, the audience I was with actually jeered and booed it (myself included) because it just looked so damn lame and stupid. So I skipped it in the cinema (as many did) but then caught it on TV a few years later. Although it is far from a perfect film and its mood and tone are poorly matched it is actually nowhere near as bad as it looked. The story is the usual earthbound angel stuff that Hollywood seems to quite like and it meanders along rather aimlessly, turning into a very vague road movie of sorts. The romance is obvious and uninspiring but generally the film is fun when it manages to have it&apos;s tongue in its cheek.\n\nThe problem is that it can&apos;t decide if it wants to be sappy and romantic or daffy fun. When it tries to be more of a traditional Hollywood romance it doesn&apos;t really work that well and indeed is rather laboured. However when it just gets silly and focuses on a really tongue in cheek Michael then it is much more enjoyable as long as you can buy into the sense of humour that it is selling. These two styles don&apos;t really come together and they give the film a rather fragmented feel that takes away from the fun (if silly) aspect that stood a good chance of really working if given a little bit more dominance in the film. Sadly the film falls back too much on sentimentality and it sours the mix because it is manufactured, processed, unengaging and quite forced.\n\nFor the same reason the performances are mixed. For the most part Travolta is quite funny and just appears to be taking the p*ss and enjoying himself  the way he doesn&apos;t seem to take it seriously helped me enjoy the film a lot more. He is silly of course but I found this to be enjoyable in light of the more ponderous &apos;worthy&apos; roles he has played in the years since his Pulp Fiction comeback. Lumbered with the promise of romance, Hurt is not that good but is nicely cynical for the majority of the movie; MacDowell is painfully lame at times and her character is pretty poor, she is a big part of the reason why it is hard to really care about the romance in the story. Both Pastorelli and Hoskins seem to have fun and share a handful of good lines throughout the movie while little roles for other well known faces vary between the effective (Joey Lauren Adams) and the simply pointless (did Richard Schiff really need work this badly?).\n\nAnyway, the film is not great but it is not awful either. It&apos;s mix of the sappy and the silly is pretty badly done and I was left wanting a more engaging romance and a lot more of Travolta&apos;s mockingly silly performance. All told it is maybe worth a watch once but it is far from being a good film and, if you don&apos;t like John Travolta&apos;s performance then there isn&apos;t a great deal else to watch it for."

He does his best to make her life easier in a place that she hates, and his pain and frustration mount as he sees how she is destroying herself.  His deep, sincere, and inarticulate caring for her touched me profoundly.  I wished that a romantic love could develop between them (and I am not generally into movie romances -- very few of them really work for me) but that was out of the question from the beginning, since Lao Jin was castrated.  That very fact gave their relationship a sense of tragedy from the beginning.\n\nI would love to see more of this Tibetan actor, Lobsang.  Imdb info shows this movie as his only film credit.\n\nThe locale was spectacular and gorgeously photographed. Only intellectually could I understand Xiu Xiu&apos;s dislike of such a gorgeous place (as well as her lack of appreciation for Lao Jin&apos;s caring for her).  But both characters were very believable and involving, and this sad movie will stay with me for a long time.",

Nando Moriconi is a young Italian who loves everything American; he tries to dress, walk, talk, and think like an American. From the start, a voice-over introduces him, and we&apos;re allowed to explore his American-memorabilia-filled room. This serves as a very good character introduction. Without meeting him yet, we already have a good idea of who he is, an idea that the film will emphasize time and again by Nando&apos;s desire to cross the Atlantic and visit the U. S. A.\n\nUn Americano a Roma captures the Italian culture of the 1950s&apos; and the post-war fascination many youngsters had for the United States culture. The Golden Age of Hollywood was what positioned the U. S. A. As the leading force in entertainment, and it&apos;s no surprise echoes of this would reach across Europe. There are many hilarious scenes in this story where Nando&apos;s italo-american way of speaking, he randomly uses words in English while talking in Italian, stands out among his fellows, but also when his opinion of mastering the American language clashes with reality, producing bad communication and misunderstanding.",

It boggles the mind that women would even want to spend 5 seconds around the main character, let alone sleep with him.\n\nLikewise, the female characters are equally unrealistic. One gets the impression of a bunch of actors standing around trying to memorise lines or improvise comedy at a rehearsal.\n\nOne cannot believe their motivations for anything, or their reactions to each other, making this film utterly unwatchable."

I can see why the &quot;Goldfinger&quot; director had OddJob mute. Because Sakata&apos;s line readings are so bad, they might as well have dubbed in his voice. Why was poor George Lazenby cast to play in such trashy films? Was he really that bad in &quot;On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service&quot;? Did the director of this film think that by casting two Bondian actors in this film that he would be raising the production value of such a horrible script?  The action scenes are so tame and unexciting, that you can&apos;t believe why Jim Kelly would allow this to be vehicle in his career after the success of &quot;Enter The Dragon&quot;. The only one aspect of this film worth viewing (with the exception of the Bondian actors) is the soundtrack. Not that it&apos;s completely brilliant, but it definately has a Rare Groove edge to it (if that&apos;s your bag), but I doubt a Soundtrack album ever accompanied this &quot;drive-in&quot; &quot;B-&quot; movie. Oh, and Jim Kelly has a cool red jump suit to wear. But that&apos;s about it. If the opening scene (with a woman getting stitched up in a nauseating slow pace) doesn&apos;t get you to turn the video off, the action will slowly put you to sleep. Only interesting if you were ever curious to see what George Lazenby got up to after his turn at James Bond."

Each movie vehical has to express not only specific acts and dialogue of the cast but has to also expell an artistic quality. A movie unlike television shows must be reviewed wholistically. Either a movie is a good total package or it is not. This is why most movie sequels do not work. It is usually impossible to recreate the unique once in a lifetime artistic expression of a film. I would suggest movie reviewers keep this in mind. Of course one should never watch movies with commercials. This totally breaks up the continuity and artistic expression of any film and reduces them to the level of a television episode. This film gave me a very mello, soft feeling, I could feel the main character&apos;s growing love and attraction as she discovered her innermost desires. I believe that the movie wanted the viewer to feel the passion in her mind not the actual phyical interaction with the bodies."

When he starts to approach her, she thinks he&apos;s a stalking salesman. People think she&apos;s a nuts. Or drunk.\n\n As a Christmas movie, Koi wa maiorita is refreshing. There&apos;s no Santa, no Christmas carols (replaced by lovesick J-rock and bubbly-happy J-pop songs), there&apos;s even no church.  Actors Karasawa and Esumi make a great duo. And contrary to American kids, Japanese children cannot see angels.\n\n And another thing. Different to Hollywood, Japanese features are free to end the story NOT in happy ending (as demonstrated by various anime). This story MAY or MAY NOT concludes happily. One thing is for sure - Tokyo on Christmas is amazing.",

      "reviewBody": "A hideous crime rocks a Deep South community and those who exploited it know THEY WON&apos;T FORGET the part they played in the shame &amp; violence that ensued.\n\nOf all the hard-hitting dramas produced by Warner Brothers Studio in the 1930&apos;s, this was one of the most powerful. Absolutely no holds are barred in showing the aftermath of the murder of a pretty college girl and how events took on a life of their own - crushing the innocent lives who got in the way of the town&apos;s thirst for revenge. The film starts whimsically with six ancient Confederate veterans  - among them Harry Davenport, Harry Beresford &amp; Edward McWade - on a park bench, reminiscing upon the dim past &amp; wondering if their contributions will be remembered. Poignantly, evil is about to reemerge and the old men will soon disappear, the dead ashes of the past engulfed by the passionate flames of the present. An urgent plea against sectarian hatred &amp; mindless violence, the film sweeps the viewer along to its ultimate shattering climax.\n\nClaude Rains gives a knock-out performance as the local politician who sees the murder as a chance to sweep him into the State Senate. Using his considerable vocal talent - even with his somewhat bizarre idea of a Southern accent - Rains steamrollers over nearly everyone else in the cast, deftly showing his character&apos;s utter fixation on prosecuting the case.\n\nKudos should also be extended to Edward Norris as the Northern teacher accused of the murder; Lana Turner as the victim; Elisha Cook Jr. as her strangely nervous boyfriend; and especially Clinton Rosemond as the terrified black janitor who discovers the crime.\n\nAlthough Warners is at pains at the outset to deny any connection the story might have with an actual occurrence, the film is roughly based on the notorious 1913 murder of Atlanta factory worker Mary Phagan.",

It showed some very promising acting from a few young actresses and I liked the directing. The main problems are that there wasn&apos;t enough character development of, well, any of them, the resolution seemed rushed and not nearly as epic as it could have been, and the mystery surrounding the character of Ernessa was, instead of intriguing, just puzzling. It&apos;s a little hard to describe, but I didn&apos;t feel that intangible suspense and relation to the characters that I&apos;d like to have felt. Overall, I&apos;d say it&apos;s worth a watch, but I do wish it had been better crafted.",

As Irons pursues the diva he&apos;s attracted to, she toys with his foreign ignorance of the cultural differences between their Western &amp; Eastern societies.\n\nIn a sense, she keeps the diplomat at a distance for 18 years while their affair continues by becoming his teacher of cultural difference. The romantic &amp; erotic chemistry between the diplomat &amp; opera singer is a very famous true story written by David Henry Hwang--&quot;Madame Butterfly.&quot; There have been numerous stage &amp; screen renditions of the story.\n\nI like this (1994) version best because David Cronenberg is undoubtedly the finest director to deal with the most important topic in the story: gender bending. &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; is the Canadian Cronenberg&apos;s first Hollywood funded debut. The surprise plot of the sorted true love story is one of espionage. An adults only film, it is one of intrigue, sizzling romance, twists &amp; turns, deception &amp; betrayal."

It takes skill and judgment to make a memorable movie out of this type of material, and &quot;The Crowd&quot; is one of numerous quality pictures from the final years of the silent era that deserve to be much better remembered.\n\nJames Murray and Eleanor Boardman are completely believable as a typical couple starting out with all kinds of dreams and expectations. As they gain increasing experience in the real world, their reactions to events, especially on Murray&apos;s part, are by no means always appealing, but they are always genuine. The characters&apos; flaws are made clear, yet you cannot help wishing for better things for them.\n\nThe story is structured carefully, with some interesting parallels between the early scenes and the closing sequences. With only a handful of really dramatic turns, the story reveals many things about the characters that implicitly comment on human nature in general. It does not offer many solutions, but it does provide some things to think about.\n\nThe symbolism of &quot;The Crowd&quot; fits well with the story, and it adds another dimension to this very effective drama. The occasional camera views of the office workers and other expansive settings re-emphasize the image in a resourceful and visually striking fashion."

      "reviewBody": "This is a very good rock video with solid presentations by Paul McCartney and his band. Footage is off several stops along the way on his big World Tour around 1990.\n\nPaul and his group perform many of the old Beatles songs, along with his solo efforts after the famous band had broken up. The lighting in here was outstanding. I couldn&apos;t help wondering how much Paul paid just to put on these concerts. He even added fireworks to one of the numbers!\n\nLike all good performers, McCartney has an excellent band backing him up, particularly a guitarist whose name I don&apos;t know but the guy looked like actor James Caan. Paul&apos;s wife Linda also was in the band. I didn&apos;t see her do much but it&apos;s sad to see her now knowing she died at such a young age.\n\nFor me, the finale was the best on the tape with the title song &quot;Get Back,&quot; along with songs off the &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; album, all of which were some of my favorite Beatles tunes. \n\nEarlier in the concert, you see old film clips of the Beatles accompanying some of the songs, and that was nice to see. As with most concert tapes of any length, you&apos;ll get a few numbers you can skip but whatever your tastes, you&apos;ll get more than enough good rock &apos;n roll here.",

      "name": "Grief diary",
      "reviewBody": "Irène is a video diary from director Alain Cavalier, an investigation of his undiminished grief following the death of his wife Irène Tunc back in the 1970s. Cavalier as a director of feature films within the mainstream French film industry, has been an almost failure. Debuting as a helmer he made two star-led movies, working with the likes of Romy Schneider and Alain Delon, but employing rather obscure and uninteresting political plots. Never really managing to shift gears, he suffered a long career break following the death in her prime of model, actress, and his wife, Irène (in the film he mentions her once making a jibe that he was not a director of the top drawer). Without the solitary success of his eponymous biopic of St Thérèse Lisieux, which won the César for best film and also the Jury prize at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival, he may have been considered an interesting failure.\n\nHowever we also have film diarist Alain Cavalier, altogether of more interest, who is allowed full rein to his obsessions when working on his own, working with economy and ingenuity. At his heart he is revealed an admirer and pedestaller of women, having frequent conversations with a poster of Sophie Marceau, an actress he admits to never having met. Indeed if you watch his first feature as director, Le combat dans l&apos;île, it seems that his sole driving concern is to film as much of Romy Schneider&apos;s beauty and energy as possible, with any other element of the production relegated to distant last place. His marriage is an epitome of this, having chosen to wed a literal Miss France in Irène Tunc. His view is summed up by his intonation of, &quot;Oh beautiful woman, intelligent and lively, who confirms the planet&apos;s faith in the quality of the human race.&quot; Beautiful women are his reason to live.\n\nWorking with almost no means, with a cheap digital camera and shooting empty hotel rooms and inside the houses of friends, he does somehow manage quite a lot of magic, proof that there is some real talent here. There are moments where his booming voice and hieratic prognostications verge on pretentiousness, and some scenes are almost staggeringly objectifying. Yet his stark honesty manages to carry proceedings forward, as well as a series of well-spaced emotional revelations that keeps the work from monotony. Cavalier really is bearing all here, and I cannot think of any movie that is more intimate.",

      "reviewBody": "In Fact, there are quiet many German movies which have brought the evidence to establish themselves as classics. In general these movies are dramas or comedies and very often they provide the viewer with historical informations of a certain time and area. However, what is often missing is suspense. Allhough German television is full of good crime stories and thrillers this Genre is hardly found in German cinema. \n\nAt least this is one reason why I like this movie so much. 23 allows to enter the mind of a burnt out, intelligent but unloved son, who tried to break out of his boring life by rebelling against his dominant father and the establishment of the mid 80th. Where as his protest uses to be more like coming out of a group behavior which is based on ideals his intention during the movie changes completely and ends up in a computer spy environment heavily connected with a continuous downward development of his mental and physical condition. \n\nIn one sentence: This movie is one of those that shouldn&apos;t end because you want to know more about everything,the whole thing, so deep you will place yourself into the plot and you don&apos;t want to leave it. 23 changed my life. Afterwards, I had another opinion about reality.\n\nCheck it out yourself, I extremely recommend this movies",

It features some great performances by veteran actors and even C. Thomas Howell! The special effects were truly mind-blowing and unique. It&apos;s so refreshing to see a movie without the use of CGI these days. I can&apos;t praise this film enough. Do yourself a favor and go see it. Earlier in the day I was contemplating suicide, but when I flipped to the Sci-Fi channel and started watching Glass Trap I remembered how great life really is. Glass Trap saved my life, it could save yours too. rofl",

      "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s face it, if you&apos;re going to rent one of the later movies in a slasher movie series, you&apos;d be an idiot to expect high art. The fact that this is the tenth movie in the Friday the 13th franchise, the most knuckle-draggingly, ball-scratchingly cretinous &apos;horror&apos; series of all time AND it&apos;s set in space doesn&apos;t exactly suggest that this&apos;ll be an all-time classic, but it&apos;s a good fun way to kill an hour and thirty minutes nonetheless.\n\nOkay, the plot is so thin even a slight breeze would make it disintegrate and the horror element is practically non-existent but then Jason movies abandoned that long ago in favour of just providing dumb escapism with inventive and bloody death scenes, which this film certainly provides. People are sliced in half, impaled on large spikes, blown up, one poor woman even getting her head dunked in liquid nitrogen and shattered on a desk, but the characters are so one-dimensional and it&apos;s so cheesy you&apos;re more likely to laugh than scream. And I defy you to watch the scene when Jason gets transformed into &apos;Uber Jason&apos; for the first time and not have a colossal grin traverse your face. There&apos;s even a later scene which pokes fun at the earlier movie&apos;s clichés with a hilarious &quot;beating one camper to death with the other&quot; sequence.\n\nThis is not The Exorcist, it&apos;s not The Omen, it&apos;s even a very long way away from the original Friday The 13th, but as director James Isaac has said, &quot;it&apos;s just fun.&quot; Get your mates round, pop open a beer, disengage brain and you&apos;ve got a very entertaining ninety minutes.",

      "name": "Historical melodrama about the troubled relationships among Cayetana de Alba, Goya , Pepita Tudó and Godoy",
      "reviewBody": "This is a melodrama involving 18-19th century famed Spanish painter named Goya, the famous model of the Naked Maja and the favorite Godoy . It&apos;s a slow vision of Saragossan painter Francisco Goya Lucientes, Duchess Alba and Godoy , previous years to the French encroachment . On July 23 of 1802, the Duchess of Alba (Aitana Sánchez Gijón) , the wealthy and most liberated woman of her time, offers a gala to inaugurate her new palace . Attendance is first class : the Prime Minister Manuel Godoy (Jordi Mollá) , the painter Goya (Jorge Perugorría) and Pepita Tudo (Penélope Cruz) , lover of Godoy and his model Goya&apos;s famous painting The Nude Maja and The Dressed Maja . The next morning, the Duchess of Alba is found dead in her bed in mysterious circumstances , supposedly poised. She was 40-year old . From now on , a twisted intrigue takes place to find who&apos;s the alleged killer.\n\nVolavérunt is a 1999 French-Spanish historical drama film directed by Bigas Luna based on a novel with the same title by Antonio Larreta , the film is set in Spain at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Based on the novel by Antonio Laretta , winner of the prestigious Planeta Award . The film was presented in the official section of the 1999 San Sebastián Film Festival. In that same edition of the festival, Aitana Sánchez-Gijón won the Silver Shell to Best Actress for this film . This is a costumer partially based on facts but predominates the slow-moving melodrama with a messing intrigue about a suspicious crime . The picture relies heavily on love relationships among the main roles Goya , Godoy , Maria Luisa De Palma, Pepita Tudo and Duchess of Alba . Glamorously and sumptuosly shot with great settings , evocative musical score by Alberto García Demestres and colorful cinematography by Paco Feminia filmed on location in Parque de El Capricho, Madrid, Madrid, and Jerez de la Frontera, Cádiz, Andalucía, Spain. But it results to be a failed period thriller , despite its promising start , the film gradually falls apart , leading to a finale of sheer nonsense . Volaverunt is an average movie , a flag of inexplicable rudeness , sordid sex scenes almost soft-core and extreme crudeness in a seasoned professional like Bigas Luna . The film&apos;s budget, one of the highest in the history of Spanish cinema, amounted to 1,200 million pesetas , but being really wasted , only special mention for the spectacular horse parade . There are beautiful costumes, the majesty of the palaces, the always successful locations , everything ceases to be impressive when you discover that despite taking a long time swallowing this big budget picture , you will still have it for a long time since if it is about portraying Spanish history . In fact , there&apos;s a very brief portrayal of a few historical events , if appearing notorious characters , such as : Aitana Sánchez-Gijón as Cayetana &apos;Duquesa de Alba&apos; , Penélope Cruz as Pepita Tudó &apos;La Maja&apos;, Jordi Mollà as Don Manuel de Godoy &apos;Príncipe de La Paz&apos; , Jorge Perugorría as Don Francisco de Goya y Lucientes , Stefania Sandrelli as Reina María Luisa de Parma and Zoe Berriatúa as Príncipe Fernando VII son of the king Carlos IV . The motion picture was mediocrely directed by Bigas Luna. Rating : 4.5/10.\n\nFreely based on actual events as well as historical roles and especially Manuel Godoy . This essential character in the Spanish history , Manuel Godoy y Álvarez de Faria, nicknamed Prince of the Peace, 1st Duke of Alcudia, 1st Duke of Sueca, 1st Baron of Mascalbó (12 May 1767 - 4 October 1851) was First Secretary of State of Spain from 1792 to 1797 and from 1801 to 1808. He received many titles, including that of príncipe de la Paz (&apos;Prince of the Peace&apos;), by which he is widely known. Godoy is best known for his diplomacy with Napoleon. In 1804 Godoy was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Godoy came to power at a young age as the favourite of King Charles IV and Queen Maria Luisa. Despite multiple disasters, Godoy maintained power. Many Spanish leaders blamed him for the disastrous war with Britain that cut off the Spanish Empire and ruined its finances. Crown Prince Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias, led an attempt to oust Godoy in 1807. Godoy&apos;s unpopularity culminated in the Tumult of Aranjuez in March 1808, which forced him into exile.",

      "reviewBody": "A romance movie may be simple to make, but also amongst the most difficult. Almost every other movie out there has a romantic angle in it, and if the movie is one that has it as a primary, it either be something jolly good to appeal to the masses with a strong storyline, or be differentiated through the many gimmicks like time travel or the supernatural, or contain charismatic and beautiful leads to shoulder the movie.\n\nJohnnie To has decided to take a temporal walk away from his contemporary crime thrillers of late, and gone into the romance genre. This isn&apos;t something new though, as he had lent his hand in directing romantic flicks like Turn Left, Turn Right. I still maintain that romance may not be his forte, but it only means that he should get more capable scriptwriters to craft a story of more substance, rather than to have the story feel as if it&apos;s coasting through trivial circumstance after trivial circumstance, that even the gimmicks employed - ghostly apparitions and novelty like being the male lead Vic Chou&apos;s movie debut, fail to lift the movie from baseline mediocrity.\n\nVic plays Dong, a school basketball player who cheats on his school flower girlfriend to get into the pants of Yan (Li Bing Bing), whom he discovers trying to taunt his girlfriend with their secret trysts. Frustrated, he chases her car in a motorcycle, and in one of the most ridiculous scenes ever in trying to find out if she loves him or not, deserved to die for his dumb recklessness.\n\nFast forward 3 years, and Yan is now a law clerk, but cannot forget the guilt and responsibility she felt for causing Dong&apos;s death. Relying on drugs to get by, she soon gets visited by Dong (yes, he waited for 3 years to decide to linger around, hence the title), and the two begin a journey of quaint discovery of themselves, and of their love toward one another, all this while with many forgettable supporting characters (like the impetuous teenager who is a Dong-wannabe) trying very hard to either compensate for the weak leads, or thrown in to create yet another convoluted, unnecessary sub plot, like themes of family, of second changes, reconciliation and forgiveness, bloating what is essentially short film material into a feature length.\n\nThere are many faults in the movie, which at times passes off as cheap comedy. Ghosts, if you believe, usually linger around our realm so as to finish off outstanding business. Here, the outstanding business happens to be finding out if a girl loves you from 3 years ago, and waiting out quite vengefully for a dad to ask for forgiveness. However, Vic Chou comes across more as Casper style, the friendly ghost with zero character, made worst by his non existent acting. Bottom line is, he crashes and burns in his big screen outing, playing an unremarkable character that his limited acting ability can never transcend, apart from being whiny.\n\nLi Bing Bing tries hard, but comes across as that - trying hard. If any good thing were to come out of this, it would be lending her vocals to the theme song. Otherwise, her Yan has nothing much to offer, character wise, being a girl who&apos;s trying to figure out her life out of drugs, and coming to terms with guilt, which is soothed by the reappearance of her ghostly lover.\n\nYou&apos;ll feel absolutely nothing at all for the lead characters, which point to a failure, especially for a romance movie. With a terribly weak storyline no thanks to Ivy Ho, it felt that To had to direct this in order to try and salvage the movie from its weak plot. However, you&apos;d probably find more fun identifying each time a To regular like Maggie Shiu (as in the credits), Lam Suet and Roy Cheung appear on screen, rather than try to tear your hair out in giving an iota of chance for the story, and the leads, to work something out. Don&apos;t hold out for a satisfying ending though, as everything about the movie is way below average.\n\nVic Chou fans may only be the ones supporting a movie like this, having the much talked about love scene touted to see their idol bareback/chested. But urgh, on the big screen it has lots of zits. And sex with clothes on, under the blanket, is always such a turn off."

OK it misses the magical atmosphere, good special effects and cast but it still is a movie worth seeing.\n\nGood things about the movie are the nicely choreographed fight sequence&apos;s and the pretty solid and satisfying end fight. Also the movie provides some successful comical moments.\n\nStill there are some major flaws in the movie. The story itself about the prophecy is quite weak and silly and it&apos;s hard to tell at times who are exactly the bad guys, due to some poor casting and bad story telling. Some of the scene&apos;s were also edited poorly together. The special effects are far from the best ever but also far from the worst. They look acceptable enough.\n\nRobby Benson (best know for voicing the beast in Disney&apos;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.) wasn&apos;t exactly the best choice to voice Drake, he&apos;s boring and makes some of the dialog sound silly. Overall the acting is pretty solid by the rest of the cast, of unknown actors.\n\nWith some more work on the script, this movie could have been really great. I certainly wouldn&apos;t mind seeing a third &quot;Dragonheart&quot; movie being made.\n\n6/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture has its unique place in cinema history as probably the first television series to get a big screen motion picture. Completely due to its special fan base, the like of which has never been seen before or since.\n\nIn order to keep the phenomenon going Gene Roddenberry knew he had to have something special to offer and he did. The continuity from the television series was accomplished effortlessly, in fact one of the new characters Commander William Decker is the son of William Windom who was another starship captain in an episode. More I can&apos;t say less I give the plot away.\n\nIn fact Decker played by Stephen Collins would be commanding the newly fitted Enterprise if it were on a routine mission. But with the threat of an immense alien being on a direct path to earth now Admiral James T. Kirk takes command of the starship himself and with Decker reunites all the old crew from the TV series to meet the threat.\n\nFans of the original series will also see the similarities in plot between another episode involving the Enterprise meeting up with an old space probe that now has taken on some new functions. The same idea forms the basis of this film&apos;s story although in every way it has been expanded and a new ending conceived. Here&apos;s a hint, a budding relationship between Collins and new ship&apos;s lieutenant Persis Khambatta is what ultimately saves the earth.\n\nJust as you remember them William Shatner, DeForest Kelley, Leonard Nimoy, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, and Walter Koenig are all back and completely in character as you remember them. The new people Collins, Khambatta and the rest are integrated nicely into the story.\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture received three Academy Award nominations, for Best Art&amp;Set Direction, Best Visual Effects, and Best Musical Score. The special effects never overwhelm the telling of a good story which is the primary mission and best asset of the original television series and its successors. \n\nIf you&apos;re not a Trekkie before seeing this film, you may be come one upon viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "It would be difficult to imagine a more perfect trio of performers the likes of Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles in the emotionally-charged &quot;Million Dollar Baby.&quot; \n\nMy favorite scenes were the early sequences in which Maggie (Swank) visits the dowdy boxing gym and co-opts Eastwood&apos;s crusty boxing trainer Frankie into becoming her mentor. Along with the veteran, retired boxer Eddie, played by Freeman, the performances were as electric as the Ali shuffle.\n\nIn the overall arc of the story of &quot;Million Dollar Baby,&quot; there were three extraneous subplots: (1) Frankie&apos;s visits to church and his talks with the priest; (2) the story of the mentally-challenged young man named Danger, who appears in the gym and is taunted by the boxers; and (3) Maggie&apos;s family members introduced in two scenes filled with such vulgarity that much of the film&apos;s hard-earned credibility was lost. Not only would the film have worked effectively without the subplots, it would have been a much better film without them.\n\nWhile Eastwood&apos;s direction was superb, much credit should also go to the designers, especially the stylish work with lighting. I cannot recall a film as dimly lit as this one, and the subdued lighting contributed substantially to the characters and mood evoked in this sensitive film. The three main performances were standouts. But this film was also a very successful team effort.",

What I thought was going to be a Laura Dern chick flick turned into a really exciting, character driven political commentary in the league of BOYS DON&apos;T CRY. However, where BOYS is extremely dramatic and intense, RUTH is comic and satirical.  No matter which side of the abortion debate you find yourself on, you&apos;ll recognize this rogues gallery of overly self-righteous fools and freaks that crowd our existence as well as Ruth&apos;s. Where another reviewer here finds the story predictable, I don&apos;t see how anyone could guess the end of this feature.  Not that it&apos;s some clever, ingenious twist like the end of the SIXTH SENSE.  It&apos;s merely not the way most movies end, and although slightly a fluffy ending, it&apos;s definitely unpredictable.  If you enjoyed BOYS, see RUTH as part of a weekend double feature."

      "reviewBody": "The main problem I had with this otherwise appealing movie is that Lori Petty&apos;s Tank Girl has exactly the same attitude toward virtually every incident in the movie... good, bad, otherwise.  And while it&apos;s a really sharp and cool attitude, the movie might have soared if instead of merely being an attitude it had been a personality.  Then, arising from this Tank Girl personality, a whole range of interesting emotions could have been emerged, adding variety and a chance for excitement to build instead of plateauing in the first few minutes.  Because even in a romp of a pic, you still need to care about the characters.  And it&apos;s a whole bunch easier to care about a person than it is to care about an attitude.\n\nStill, I had good fun watching this movie.  The &quot;Feeling a little inadequate?&quot; scene is a minor classic.  And by chance I happened to watch this movie the same day I saw &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; and I still have a very difficult time recognizing that Naomi Watts is the same person in both films.  She&apos;s excellent in both, but so very different.  Ice-T, Jeff Kober, and Reg E. Cathey do a surprisingly effective job of creating characters from underneath their Ripper make-up... they&apos;re so good that one of the best parts of Tank Girl is just watching and listening to them.\n\nThis isn&apos;t a movie to go into with high expectations.  Read all the negative comments, take them to heart, and then watch the movie anyway.  It will make Tank Girl a pleasant surprise."

      "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this movie, sure it isn&apos;t the most original movie ever made or the best, but it was what it set out to be...which is a combo alien attack movie of the 50&apos;s plus an all-star disaster movie of the 70&apos;s.  A lot of critics don&apos;t like this one and a lot of people who think of themselves as critics don&apos;t care much for it either, but it still brought in over 300 million at the box office in the summer of 96.  I thought it was an entertaining film with lots of action and a good dose of comedy as well.  One complaint I have is that it runs a bit long and you feel the time pass not like other movies like &quot;The Two Towers&quot; where it doesn&apos;t feel like all that much time has passed.  Another problem with this movie is that it is best seen in the theater.  This movie has a score of only six at imdb, so a lot of people who saw it probably saw it on TV.  Or if they did see it at the theaters, realized it just wasn&apos;t as good on the small screen when they saw it on TV. The movie also benefited from a great ad campaign that started with a super bowl spot that showed the White House being destroyed.  The movie is basically an alien invasion movie and it is like a 50&apos;s science fiction movie.  It also has a lot of stars, not the biggest names, just like a 70&apos;s disaster flick.  If you don&apos;t care for either of these genres you probably won&apos;t like this movie, but if you like one or the other or both it is worth checking out.  Just don&apos;t take it too seriously and have fun watching it.",

In one amazing scene where she cannot resist showing her wares as a Plumber (to the disdain of the other party guests) she gets to play a reaction to the debacle that is amazing in its combination of pathos and hilarity. Very interesting character actors including a very, very funny Una O&apos;Connor (whose dialogue consists mainly of incessantly clearing her throat), the light as a feather and dead on playing of Margaret Bannerman, and also a chance to see Helen Walker. Charles Boyer plays with his customary light touch and is the anchor to this film, but finally it is Jennifer Jones&apos; performance that takes one breath away and stays with you long after you&apos;ve seen it."

      "reviewBody": "How radically different cinema history, and our collective consciousness, would have been if Frank Sinatra hadn&apos;t injured his hand before shooting started on &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;.  Sinatra was due to play Harry, but had to withdraw, clearing the way for Clint.  Given Sinatra&apos;s unique brand of self-loathing, Harry would have been an uglier personality than Clint made him.  As it is, Lieutenant Callaghan is an ornery anti-liberal cuss of a guy, but he is straight and likeable.  Arguably, it was this characterisation which made Eastwood a megastar.\n\nSan Francisco in 1971 was ready for stardom itself.  The West Coast love-in scene and the gay &apos;boom&apos;, together with McQueen&apos;s &quot;Bullitt&quot;, raised awareness of San Francisco as an exciting liberal city with a photogenic skyline.  The film&apos;s funky score by Lalo Schifrin is perfectly-judged, and spawned numerous imitators.\n\nThe central narrative concerns a lone nut who is trying to hold the city to ransom.  He starts by murdering citizens to extort money from the mayor, then progresses to kidnapping children.  This plays cleverly on the inchoate anxieties of Middle America, where law-abiding people were puzzled and alarmed at the &apos;crime wave&apos; and the threat it posed to them and their families.  Crime in the decades before the Kennedy assassination had been compartmentalised by Hollywood.  Gangsters were bad, but they killed other gangsters.  Now the danger was unpredictable, irrational - and solitary. The lone madman was as likely to strike against me or you as against an institution.  Only a single-minded strong man, operating on the fringes of the rules, could combat this new terror.\n\nHarry is a paradox.  In one sense, he is an &apos;outlaw&apos;.  He has little respect for formal authority (in the opening minutes, we see him being rude to the mayor) and he carries a strictly non-regulation monster of a gun. Harry is openly racist and mutinous.  And yet he is also deeply moral.  He conforms to an unarticulated ethical code that is anglosaxon American.  He protects the weak and confronts the wrongdoers, no matter how the odds are stacked against him.  Indeed, the cowardly bureaucrats who will never reward him or promote him are able to exploit his profound decency.  They send him on all the difficult, dirty jobs because they know that his sense of right and wrong won&apos;t allow him to walk away.\n\nEarly in the film, the famous bank robbery scene occurs.  This has become so familiar that it hardly needs elaborating here, but to summarise, Harry foils an armed robbery using icy courage and grim humour - and his magnum handgun.  The special brand of Eastwood humour recurs throughout the story (eg, the suicide jumper and the gay called &apos;Alice&apos;).  White anglosaxon America is encouraged to laugh at the undergroups which supposedly threaten it.\n\nWhen the bad guy &apos;Scorpio&apos; is cornered, he immediately starts bleating about his civil rights.  This is meant to arouse our fury, because we have seen him callously destroying the lives of others, and here he is exploiting the protection of the state.  To make matters worse, the state agrees with him.  We see the DA and a judge explaining to Harry why the cogent evidence against Scorpio is inadmissible.  Just exactly why the DA would call a meeting with a lowly policeman in order to explain department policy is far from clear, but the scene is  thematically necessary.  Scorpio is using the System against the decent, godfearing people who own it.  The liberal apparatus is skewed if it lets a killer walk away scot-free.\n\nThere are some illogicalities about the plot.  Such an important event as the cash drop is left to two cops working alone, when in reality there would be a massive covert operation.  When Scorpio beats the rap, there is no public outcry or media storm, and he is allowed to get on with his anonymous existence virtually untroubled.\n\nHowever, this hardly matters since the main thrust of the story is the coming showdown between Harry and the bad guy.  As the climax approaches, Harry drops out of the police operation.  Scorpio is at his manic worst on the hi-jacked school bus, alienating us nicely and suppressing any liberal twitches we may still be feeling.  Then we see Harry, standing as upright and sturdy as the Statue Of Liberty ...."

Hence, Venice. Although to be perfectly honest they hardly make the most of this potentially interesting, and agreeably moronic, set-up as the shark hardly attacks anyone other than various divers. And that sort of thing could happen in any shark movie let&apos;s be frank. Anyway the odd occasions that the shark does decide to attack tourists and drunken people on the surface prove to be the film&apos;s highlights, and these are few and far between.\n\nShark in Venice is effectively an action-thriller that pits good guy Baldwin against the machine-gun toting Mafioso bad guys. There&apos;s lots of shoot-outs and running about. The damn shark almost becomes incidental. Not exactly what we want. A much more accurate title for this film would have been Baldwin In Venice.",

      "reviewBody": "I am writing this review upon seeing the move, CB4, for the third time. Even after watching this film twice, I still managed to laugh my way through 99% of the jokes.  This movie showcases Chris Rock&apos;s unique and funny blend of black comedy which was still relatively unknown in his immediate post-SNL period of his career.  The jokes are fast and fresh, and come one after another and still manage to get chuckles out of the audience.  CB4 follows such films as Spinal Tap, in using the mockumentary style.  CB4 provides a documentary for a rap group headed by Albert, Chris Rock.  Rock&apos;s already established views on black culture fit in very well in his role as a middle class black man pretending to be a gangsta rapper.  The supporting cast of Allen Payne and Deezer D as Euripides and Otis respectively, provide great personas for Rock to joke off of.  The movie climaxes in a typical Chris Rock humorous way and leaves the audience feeling satisfied and happy.  The movie is also enhanced by some killer cameos in the beginning by such rapping stars as, Shaq(during his ill-fated rapping days), Ice-T, Ice-Cube, and some other famous rappers.  In a nutshell: I am only waiting for this film to be released on DVD so I can watch it over and over again."

Argue, if you must, that movies like &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, &quot;Them&quot; and &quot;Five Million Years to Earth&quot; are the cerebral grand-fathers of the film genre (and I won&apos;t disagree with you), but for &quot;science-fiction-as-plot-driven-action-epic,&quot; this is it. This is the one.\n\nIt&apos;s so unerringly on target, in fact, that it still plays very well even today. The modern audience has to overcome the &quot;Leslie Nielsen Factor&quot; (and it is difficult to watch him in a totally straight role), but once you do, the movie is pure enjoyment. Forget about dated plots and special effect. Robbie the Robot is a guy in a suit, yes, but he is thoroughly believable. He even adheres nicely to Asimov&apos;s Three Laws of Robotics, a trick that the digital robots in this summer&apos;s &quot;I, Robot&quot; had a great deal of difficulty with.\n\nAnd the monster! I defy anyone to avoid getting the willies when the monster first shorts the security fence. Great special effect, then and now!\n\nFinally, the universal theme of man&apos;s (and Krell&apos;s) individual flaws inserting themselves into an otherwise perfect system and TOTALLY gumming up the works is as relevant today as it was then. More so."

      "reviewBody": "This film is an excellent example of a great idea very poorly executed. The story is actually good but the actual story-telling is poor. First off the Brit in the capsule, Guy Taylor, was far from stoic or calm. The &quot;former fighter pilot&quot; was too emotional and lacked all the qualities you&apos;d expect in someone picked to be &quot;the first man in space&quot;. I don&apos;t know if this was due to bad directing, bad acting or both, but as Arnie would say, he was a &quot;girlie-man&quot;. Secondly, the first half of the film is painfully slow and I found myself drifting away and losing interest. Despite all this I was pleasantly surprised by how it ended, but it was too late by then. If you want to see a fine example of a movie with just one actor well executed have a look at Tom Hardy in &quot;Locke&quot;. In fact I think that Hardy would have made a much better Guy Taylor.",

He has trained for this for three years at the height of the Cold War and now he is alone in space, suffering Hypoxia, with a malfunctioning capsule.

Cruel, how German media has otherwise banned Kohl from reports due to the bribe scandal which is none in all other western countries, not even by morale means. However the left wing majority has deemed Kohl to be persona non grata despite his quite historical importance for reunification. Gives immense inner views of CDU powerplay and private matters. Acting is superbe, genius script, technically great, worthwhile watching not only for politically interested audience.",

Really, nothing of this movie is funny, or disturbing, or anything else it claims to be so don&apos;t waste your money.  The only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy.  I&apos;m not lying about that.  Someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film.  It is that awful.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The &apos;Burbs&quot; is writer / co-producer / actor Dana Olsens&apos; deliberately warped invention. The idea is to remove the picture perfect outer layer of average American suburban life and reveal what potential insanity could be bubbling underneath. In so doing, he also makes fun of suburbanites who seem to make it their business to know everybody elses&apos; business.\n\nTom Hanks stars as Ray Peterson, your typical &apos;burb dweller, who ends up severely stressed out when his nutty neighbors - Bruce Dern as ex-military man Mark Rumsfield and the late comedian Rick Ducommun as nosey instigator Art Weingartner - spur him to action. They keep hearing weird noises, and seeing weird things, concerning the newcomers to the street, the Klopeks (Henry Gibson, Brother Theodore, Courtney Gains), and wonder just what the hell is going on inside the Klopek house. To make matters more interesting, their elderly neighbor Walter Seznick (Gale Gordon) goes missing. Could the Klopeks be responsible for his disappearance?\n\nRay tries his best to be rational and skeptical, but finds himself drawn in more and more by his kooky comrades and the things he witnesses. Acting as a genuine voice of reason is his understandably frustrated wife Carol (Carrie Fisher).\n\nThe whole thing becomes rather over the top, but then a sense of anarchy to his stories has always been filmmaker Joe Dantes&apos; (&quot;Piranha&quot; &apos;78, &quot;The Howling&quot;, &quot;Gremlins&quot;) strong suit. Olsen and Dante have fun with the dark comedy aspect to this yarn, and there are some quite funny bits along the way. Viewing the whole circus from the sidelines is neighborhood teen Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman), who tries to convince his peers that the goings on here are better than any movie they could watch. Among those who really get into the spirit of the material are production designer James Spencer and composer Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nHanks is terrific, and much like the legendary Gene Wilder, proves to be a master at freaking out in a comedic way. But the whole cast is great, with Ducommun often going to town on the scenery. The cast is filled with familiar faces: Wendy Schaal, Dick Miller (Dantes&apos; good luck charm for many years), Robert Picardo, Franklyn Ajaye, Rance Howard, Nicky Katt, Kevin Gage, Patrika Darbo. Olsen himself appears as a cop.\n\nWhile the story is ultimately rather predictable, it does keep you watching, and amused - and may make you wonder what goes on behind your own neighbors&apos; doors.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Gang of Four&quot; is hard to find words for. However I think it does address, in a detached and engaging manner, the themes of coming-of-age and community in the lives of several young women at an elite prestigious acting school? \n\nAnd gender seems to be the most specific definer of these themes. The teacher, Constance, at some point in her professional career, made the decision to exclude male students from her school. This in turn informs the lives of her young actors, who are each expected to play male role and female roles. Claude seems especially affected by this form of teaching and experiences much confusion in discerning men and in her own gender identity.\n\nLucia, another of the four, has disgraced her family over her refusal to marry a pre-selected husband. Anna, whose actual name is Laura, takes this name to hold the memory of her missing sister close to her thoughts and actions. Cecile is not one of the gang of four (she left this residence house earlier) but she is having much of her identity shaped by a relationship to Antoine, who seems to be involved in some kind of dubious radical or criminal activities (this was never clear to me).\n\nAnd then there&apos;s Thomas who seems to be the cross between a mole and a eunuch, who slithers into the the female household, in his ostensible pursuit of the elusive Antoine. However, his unstated purpose seems to be to disrupt and control the individual lives and growing commonality of the four women. He manipulates one woman against another by seduction, lies, and feigned heroism. And with an unrelenting mocking presence for which he has no compunction he puts the full disruptive burden of his presence onto them If it&apos;s Constance&apos;s resolve to exerts a kind of pressure on her charge&apos;s youthful insecurity and dependency and steer them clear of false emotions, Thomas&apos; resolve is to break their solidarity, not test it.\n\nDespite the drama on and off the stage, and all the motion, energy, body language, gestures, declamations, and tantrums, the general effect is both low key and even. No one stands out except perhaps Laurence Cote and Bulle Ogier as Claude and Constance. In the end, all the closures and variables in the lives depicted seem begin to co-exist. The young women come to inhabit their own scripts, and this in a world without and sometimes in spite of men.",

      "name": "Raavanan - Not among the best works of Mani Rathnam!!!!",
      "reviewBody": "We know Mani Rathnam can handle epics quite easily and can twist it quite interestingly. Dalapathy starring Rajnikanth and Mamootty is the finest example. That is what I expected when I went to watch Raavanan. But watching the movie, I realized the story was never the center of attraction neither the direction of the maestro. What moved the movie along was the cinematography. Santosh Sivan and Manikandan have so effectively captured the beauty of the southern forests in the most mesmerizing manner.\n\nComing back to the story, we find nothing new added to the epic except for the fact that the good has now turned evil and vice-versa. At the end of the movie, after witnessing the glorious work of the cinematographer, especially the climax scenes, we sense something missing altogether and the truth beckons on us that there is no credible storyline to the whole affair.\n\nSP Dev (Prithviraj) is on the look out for Veera (Vikram), a notorious tribal lord, a Robin Hood for many. He rules with his own laws and methods and this angers the police but are unable to do anything to capture him. To assist him there is Singarasu (Prabhu) and Chakkarai (Munna), his brothers. But soon something happens (revealed only in the second half) that makes Veera so revengeful that he kidnaps Dev&apos;s wife, Ragini (Aishwarya Rai). The rest of the story revolves around the Dev trying to rescue his wife with the help of Gnanapraksham (Karthick), a forest guard. The story moves on when the monstrous Veera starts a liking for Ragini.\n\nThere was a time when I watched Nayakan, Iruvar, Roja, Dalapathy all with great enthusiasm and what I received from these movies were really great satisfaction as a movie buff. But watching this film with the same enthusiasm I felt robbed off all my money I wasted on the tickets. This is not a bad film but it is clearly not what I expected from a Mani Rathnam film. His direction has not proved anything with this movie. The old Mani Rathnam had style and substance in his direction but now what remains is just the style. Style alone cannot pace a thriller forward. The new Mani Rathnam has not provided anything interesting in this movie. It seems like the crux of the whole movie lies on the camera work.\n\nThe acting of Vikram and Aishwarya Rai has to be applauded. They have given one of their finest performances. Vikram is like a vengeful monster who has kidnapped wife of the God-like figure on earth to settle a personal score. His performance is one of the highlights of the movie and which makes it watchable. It is a wonder we see such talent and beauty together and that is Aishwarya Rai; though her beauty is not of any relevance in the &quot;plot&quot; she has scored with a good performance. Prithiviraj as the tough cop has really matured into a fine actor. He has given a nice performance along with the other big names. Prabhu and Karthick have utilized their time on screen portraying their characters with ease and subtlety. Priyamani with her small cameo has given a memorable performance.\n\nBut all this taken, at the end, we find the story to be clichéd and hope that the screenplay would have been better. The screenplay and dialogues penned by Suhasini Mani Rathnam does not show any ease or effectiveness probably because the story line is weak. By the interval time we feel exhausted at all that has happened but still we realize nothing has moved along. Second half proves better because of the short stint of Priyamani on screen and the final 15 minutes of the movie. And those 15 minutes is the only part in the whole movie that show &quot;some&quot; shades of Mani Rathnam direction. The characterization is so weak we never get time to realize the good has turned evil and vice versa or is it because it was so obvious from all the promos.\n\nA note on the music - AR Rahman is not at his best...but cannot say it was bad. It&apos;s okay and goes with the film smoothly.\n\nThe plus point of the movie is cinematography, acting and the last 15 minutes.\n\nThe movie deteriorates because of the absence of a fine story line and a poor screenplay which I believe are the most important materials in a film.\n\nIt is not one of the best Mani Rathnam films and it cannot be called a thriller as there is no remarkable storyline to boast off and excite us. Watch the movie to see some good acting. But mainly, watch the movie to witness the amazing locales where the movie was shot through the eyes of Santosh Sivan and Manikandan, especially the last cliffhanging fight between good and evil.\n\n~ dillitalkies.blogspot.com ~",

But because he plays his role so well you&apos;ll notice that other actors in the movie are not so talented/experienced. Sometimes you see some actors just standing there like they don&apos;t know what to do until it&apos;s time for them to say a line. Also the director could make some more cuts. The story is too slow here and there. The story is good, but maybe the screenwriter could focus more on how the resistance could stop the &apos;rabit hunt&apos; on Jewish children and keep some parts that didn&apos;t have anything to do with that out of the story to keep the movie going. But nevertheless it&apos;s a fine movie with historical value. It&apos;s about the Christian resistance in the Netherlands during the second world war and how they fought against the evil national-socialist empire of Adolf Hitler."

It&apos;s a German film and you know that from the beginning, but there are a lot that try to be like American ones and that is what makes them wretched. Have to watch a lot of these films, cause the agreement with my girlfriend is, one film for me one for her :) But this film I watched without her, spontaneously. It is funny, but not like a comedy with its easy and &quot;a thousand times in every comedy seen jokes&quot; and it is romantic, but not that hardcore sobstuff with ultra slushy music. It&apos;s not like the ones where you know what the end will be like. The two perspectives so one time from Adam&apos;s and then in Eva&apos;s, well done. And if you don&apos;t have the perfect relationship (even if you do have) with your girl or boy, guess it will make you think about it. Give it a chance and I bet you will be surprised.\n\nSorry for my English, know it&apos;s not perfect.",

      "reviewBody": "Strangely there&apos;s no review for this revenge action thriller, highly unusual for the time. As in all Warsaw Pact states, socialism was in a downward spiral in early 80s Hungary. Yet its movie industry enjoyed a high level of prestige owing to award-winning co-productions like Mephisto (1981). So film makers had a little more freedom to do genre as long as they kept politics under the rug, which made the underlying social critique even stronger.\n\nThis is a good example for that. A divorced engineer-turned-taxi driver gets fleeced by two old lady passengers. His employer and the police think he bagged the money for himself as he&apos;s constantly broke, so he concocts a scheme to sniff the ladies out by himself. Although the police discover that he has stumbled over a something big, he resorts to blackmail which quickly escalates.\n\nWhat feels like a Steve McQueen film is chock full of scathing social commentary - an ex-girlfriend actress prostitutes herself for some cash, thieves live a life of luxury while college grads can&apos;t get a job, police are everywhere yet ineffective, thugs can be hired at any subway station for a pittance and decency is suicide.\n\nThe year 1982 saw a lot of changes in the socialist sphere that ultimately led to its collapse, Brezhnev&apos;s death, martial law in Poland, consumer goods scarcity, foreign currency shadow economy all contributed to an atmosphere of decay that this film manages to convey in action format. Another example for this use of genre film as social criticism would be the Yugoslav epidemic horror Variola Vera.",

      "reviewBody": "While going to the town of Ashby Wake, the drifter Cassie (Christina Ricci) is hit by a car driven by Marion Kirkman (Kerry Fox) and loses her memory. Marion invites Cassie to stay in her huge old house with her family, while recovering from the trauma. Cassie becomes very close to Michael, the young son of Marion&apos;s husband Simon Kirkman (Stephen Dallane). He is researching a recently discovered buried church from the First Century, with images of the crucifixion of Jesus and many anonymous persons watching it. Cassie starts having visions and premonitions with some locals, and decides to investigate the weird and nasty mechanic Frederick Michael Argyle (Peter McNamara). Her findings about who she is and the mystery relative to the locals and the town surprises her. &quot;The Gathering&quot; is a good, original and mysterious horror movie, in the same line of &quot;The Others&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;and &quot;El Espinazo del Diablo&quot;. It is not gore, but very creepy and scary. Christina Ricci is magnificent, as usual, and the idea is fresh and unusual. The conclusion of the story is commercial, but it is not bad. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Encontro&quot; (&quot;The Gathering&quot;)",

Yes...the script is sometimes overly sweet. Yes, there are archetypes in the different characters. Yes, there is a distinct scent of familiar plot devices. But, who cares? Gideon delivers solid entertainment and heartwarming storytelling on a basic level. Christopher Lambert is credited as co-producer on the credits. That fact tells me one thing...that Lambert has a heart underneath the blank/sullen stare that has (in my opinion) hindered his chances of being more highly regarded in the &quot;system&quot; that is Hollywood. A good family film and fine Saturday/Sunday afternoon viewing. I would even watch this film on local TV with commercial interruption. It&apos;s that good! We need more films like &quot;Gideon&quot; to overcome the cynicism of current Hollywood movie making. In my view, &quot;Gideon&quot; is a Gem!",

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps one of the Scorsese minor masterpieces that sometimes get lost when considering &quot;Goodfellas&quot; or even &quot;Mean Streets,&quot; films that get the bulk of the chatter. This, along with &quot;King of Comedy&quot; run in a very different vein, combining black comedy with tension and suspense as a central spine to the piece. Sure, Goodfellas has some black comedic moments, but on whole, it stands as a &quot;drama&quot; rather than a comedy. This is a VERY different film and will cause you to laugh and to shake your head in sympathy and mutter &quot;Oh NO&quot; more than once. I rated it a 9, I have no idea why this got lower marks than that. See it more than once.",

      "reviewBody": "You don&apos;t need to be a hater of the Bellinga&apos;s to hate this movie. The story is lazy and mostly ripped of from other movies, the acting makes the room almost good and the Bellinga&apos;s themselves are bad characters even if you liked them in the vlogs. They are so poorly written and there is no single thing in this movie to enjoy! No jokes are funny and I can&apos;t even Imagine any fan of them liking this movie. However the camera angles and all the shots and lighting are really good so it&apos;s not 100% horrible. There are musical numbers in this movie and of course they are also terrible. Lyrics that don&apos;t make sense, melodies you hope you will forgot directly and how they&apos;re sang! It just hurts all our poor ears. The other actors in this movie are just there to exist and that&apos;s actually all. And the Bellinga&apos;s clearly expected their movie to be worse because they were really proud of it! And there are three parts of this. We didn&apos;t need any of the sequels. Watching something worthless is fine when it&apos;s fun but this isn&apos;t fun in any way. I could use the rest of the review by calling out all the movies it&apos;s stealing from but I don&apos;t have to because it&apos;s perfectly obvious. Also, this movie is annoying and constantly repeating itself. And how are we supposed to like the main characters if one of them loses all their money cause he thought he could get a hole in one? Noone learns anything in this film. Please don&apos;t watch this movie and watch a fun movie instead.",

Then the brazen, flirtatious Florette follows a life of deabuchery, prostitution, robbering and murder , while the virginal, virtuous Justine wishes to remain innocent but instead slips into a life of distress , torture , whipping , bondage , branding , kidnapping , slavery , predatory lesbianism, and salaciousness . Justine attempts to mantain her virtue and her standards against lewd people , unfortunately , she is victimized by everyone she encounters . Justine&apos;s only possible hope of true love and salvation in a suave and elegant painter : Harald Leipnitz .\n\nFreely based on Marquis Sade novel, dealing with the nubile young Justine lousily played by Romina Power , as a good-natured girl cast out of a nun orphanage who is thrust into a depraved world of abusers , crazy priests , and lascivious people . There&apos;re also some scenes dealing with Marquis de Sade : Klaus Kinski , in fact being paced by means of flashbacks when the Marquis is imprisoned during pre-French Revolution Bastille , along the way he has dreams , nightmares , vision , and a lot of images of naked women . It is a twisted tale of strange desires , betrayals , perverse pleasures , prurient men and corruption of innocence as told by the Marquis de Sade himself . And outstanding Maria Rohm as the roguish Juliette , she was a ravishing beauty married to film producer Harry Alan Towers . And Jack Palance overacting , as usual, as a supreme sadistic monk . Being a Spanish/German/Italian production , here apppears Spaniard actors as Gustavo Re , Luis Ciges , Claudia Gravi, Jose Luis Martin, Carmen De Lirio, Gerard Tichy , Italian : Sylva Koscina , Roxemary Dexter , Rosalba Neri , German : Harold Leipnitz , Klaus Kinski , Horst Frank and American : Jack Palance , Mercedes McCambridge , Akim Tamiroff , Jack Palance .

Along with a potent and rousing musical score by Bruno Nicolai. The motion picture was regularly directed by the prolific Spanish filmmaker Jesús Franco .\n\nThis book by Marquis de Sade has been adapted as &quot;Justine de Sade&quot; 1972 by Claude Pierson with Alice Arno , Marco Perrin, Franco Fantasía . &quot;Cruel Passion&quot; 1977 by Chris Boger with Koo Stark and Martin Potter .

      "reviewBody": "Stanley Kramer made his directorial debut here, following story of a medical intern who marries for money, later becoming a country doctor with an unhappy love life. Surprisingly involving adaptation of Morton Thompson&apos;s novel is both cynical and humorous, and Kramer really excels in the scenes behind hospital doors, particularly in the patient montages. He takes a good while to warm up however, and the actors also struggle getting into character. Robert Mitchum doesn&apos;t strike me as the medic type, and neither does Frank Sinatra (cutting up à la Jack Lemmon, giving the film some bounce nevertheless), but Olivia de Havilland does good work in the romance department. Second-half of the picture is more assured, if more routine, but the film is quite entertaining on the whole. **1/2 from ****",

This is in part because that country remains amazingly insular and proud of its culture and unchanging ways despite the presence of the Americans and all the world&apos;s external influence upon it. Here in this passionate offering from Sion Sono are all the usual tropes, mistreated and misunderstood youth, dispassionate parents, loan sharks and the yakuza, life, death and honour plus an almost whimsical belief in &apos;tomorrow&apos; are all on display. Shortly after the film was conceived came the Fukushima disaster with its earthquake and tsunami crippling the nuclear plant and the director amended his script to include this further element of doom and disaster. It is well done, if a little overlong, with the actors partly improvising but it is disconcertingly &apos;in your face&apos; and if the suicidal intentions seem a little drastic, the dreams of a sunny tomorrow also seem rather optimistic. The final plea to youngsters to be more positive and ride out all the pessimism seems a little naive seen from afar but may well resonate within that beautiful but mixed up country. It certainly surprised me that Sono would end the film in such an evangelical way but then I may have missed some of the film&apos;s finer points and cannot fully appreciate what it must be like to live under the perpetual threat of annihilation, never mind the constant reminders like that of Fukushima.",

A freeway opens right by the house. It gets noisier. The drivers leer. The drivers honk. The noise becomes non-stop. There is a traffic jam and people get out of their cars and stare. The family cannot deal with this and slowly go mad, cementing up the windows. The little boy is the only sane one in the movie. He handles all this as just so much adventure. One daughter is the sort you love to hate, full of herself, selfish, totally absorbed with her appearance, idle, rude. The other is just plain crazy. Mom and Dad are a very loving caring patient couple. It is a movie where the circumstances gradually deteriorate. I think of Roman Polanski&apos;s Repulsion for a similar effect. It is like a horror movie -- unpleasantness for the sake of unpleasantness. There are no murders or zombies, just frayed people who cannot cope with the situation. There is quite a bit of nudity, but I just put that down to a difference in the way the French view nudity within the family. It is not sexual. The ending made no sense to me. It just ended things in mid air without any sort of resolution. The whole movie left me queasy, and wondering if perhaps it were some great metaphor than went right over my head.\n\nKacey Mottet Klein who plays the little boy Julien is an amazing actor. Not once did I notice he was acting. He was completely believable. In one scene he begged his Mom to let him out of being locked in the bathroom. It was heart-melting. I could not stand that frail little character entombed with the rest of that wacko family.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a terrible early talkie with a flamboyant 19th century ham performance by Dennis King in the lead and a nondescript one from Jeannette MacDonald. It was filmed entirely in 2 strip Technicolor, which makes up for some of its failings. A restored print is housed at UCLA and it is the only known surviving color print. The elaborate art direction deservedly earned an Oscar nomination.\n\nIt is available on DVD from Loving the Classics, which uses an old battered 16 mm black and white television print (MCA-TV), which is 3/4 screen, blurry, washed out and with poor sound. The silence surrounding the dialogue is full of white noise.\n\nThere is the lovely score - MacDonald has three numbers: Someday, Only A Rose and Love Me Tonight.\n\nSongs:\n\nAct One: 1:08:10\n\nKing Louis - King Hymn - Chorus SOMEDAY – sung by MacDonald If I Were King - King What France Needs - King Song of the Vagabonds – King ONLY A ROSE – sung by MacDonald, joined at end by King SOMEDAY – reprise – sung by MacDonald Huguette&apos;s Waltz - sung by Roth LOVE ME TONIGHT – sung by MacDonald and King\n\nAct Two: 36:30\n\nPool Procession - Chorus Song of the Vagabonds – reprise – King Requiem – Chorus ONLY A ROSE – reprise finale – sung by Macdonald and King\n\nThis is for die-hard fans of Rudolf Friml (composer) and Jeannette MacDonald.\n\nMacDonald scenes: 11\n\nAct One: Church Interior, Street, King&apos;s Observatory, Observing Villon&apos;s transformation, Palace Walk, Balcony Scene, Observing Villon and Herald from Burgundy; Act Two: Garden, Huguette&apos;s Death Scene, Church, Gallows.",

      "reviewBody": "After turning his back on the mainstream 6 years ago with his striking yet spurned two-man tale, Gerry, acclaimed writer/director Gus Van Sant delivers once more in refined style with his own eccentric yet poignant spin on the teen&apos; movie genre.\n\nAdapted from Blake Nelson&apos;s best selling novel and shot masterfully in Van Sant&apos;s hometown of Portland, Paranoid Park hinges on an act of acute violence. Alex (Gabe Nevins) is a confused schoolboy skater whose life hits the bricks following his role in the death of a local security guard. The film itself, then, is largely told from Alex&apos;s perspective as he goes back and forth in his mind and notebook in an attempt to vindicate his tainted conscious and make sense of why and how things happened the way they did.\n\nWith the chronology of the omniscient narrative skewed and certain scenes misleading, Paranoid Park establishes a near perfect balance between form and content. The naivety and confusion stirring behind Nevins&apos; infantile eyes are both complimented and mirrored by the structure of the plot. In his feature debut, Nevins gives a modest performance of troubled teen&apos; in whom thoughts of; family, divorce, sex, skating, school and murder suffer a succession of high-speed collisions. At the age of just 15, Nevins&apos; not only performs with a quality beyond his tender years and experience, but provides a leading performance that is as convincing as it is impressive.\n\nAs for Van Sant, his tight film-making skills are exhibited throughout in what has to be considered as an experimental picture wherein an uncanny blend of hand-held, slow-mo&apos; scenic inter-cuts, out-of-sync shots and mellow off-screen alternative music carve a moody yet nonchalant atmosphere that at times suggests that this is an independent crime-mystery drama, at others: a tale of boy becomes man. Whatever it is, it brings to mind the likes of Memento and Brick. Hence, it is simply brilliant. Mystifying, moving and quite majestic. Paranoid Park is one of this year&apos;s most haunting and interesting features that ranks amidst Van Sant&apos;s finest work to date. Good Will Hunting? Not quite. But for such a question to prompt a pause for thought says a lot. See this.",

It&apos;s an interesting film obviously a lower budget but that doesn&apos;t stop a good story. And this has a good story. Well a very passable story. As I said in the tittle I think it&apos;s a good movie, not incredible but a lot better than many other movies of this budget. Worth a watch. It&apos;s actually a bit of a thriller really. A who done it who is the killer type of thing. In the end you find out everything and it&apos;s rewarding.",

      "reviewBody": "Myortvyy sezon, aka. Dead Season (1968) Soviet Union. Dir. Savva Kulish This fascinating Soviet spy noir drama is in a league of its own. If you have an interest in geo-politics and have followed closely what has taken place over the past few years, the chilling historical relevance of this classic film is extraordinary.\n\nThe story centers around the fictional western resort town of Dargate, where under the guise of a pharmaceutical center, the German war criminal Dr. Hass finishes work on a new psychochemical weapon of mass destruction - RH gas (RH). Soviet authorities are gravely concerned about this development, the sinister possibilities of the gas are such that in small doses it stimulates the intellectual potential of a person, in larger doses it turns a person into an obedient slave, satisfied with life, whatever that may be. Forced to work for one country, Hass, however, intends to transfer his secret developments to another country, West Germany...\n\nThe Dead Season is a suspenseful well-founded espionage thriller, the first Soviet film about the country&apos;s intelligence service during the Cold War. The script was based on material provided by the KGB, and the inspiration of the main hero was the famous Soviet spy, Konon Molody.\n\nThe film begins with a personal narration from Rudolf Abel, a former spy, senior colleague and friend of Konon Molody.\n\nAbel addresses the audience, presenting startling facts about the bioweapons that are being developed at places such as Fort Derrick in the USA and Portland Downs in the UK... remember this is 1968.\n\nIn collaboration with Abel the film&apos;s director made sure that the production was based on actual events and has historical accuracy, particularly with its depiction of the covert work of the real intelligence service of the USSR. Highly Recommended !!",

Working for her in the book store are a handsome college student (Tom Everett Scott), a feisty store manager (Ellen DeGeneres), and a sweet young teenager (Juliane Nicholson). Waiting in the wings is Tom Selleck, the town fireman, who has held a torch for Capshaw all his life. These are all pleasant folks to spend a couple of hours with. The town is picturesque and the background score is romantic (by Luis Bacalov, composer of Il Postino). It&apos;s interesting to note that everyone does not end up with whom you expect. Supporting roles are ably, though too briefly, handled by Blythe Danner and Gloria Stewart (Titanic). Director, Peter Chan, who has been involved in the Hong Kong film world, has done surprisingly well with this material which is so American. I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll be hearing from him again."

I admit, the pace was slowwwww..... but in this age of fast-cuts, it was nice to see a director trying to do something different -- trying to create a state, rather than just tell a story. The plot is simple, two guys through lack of attention get lost in the desert. Thats it. In the next few days we follow the characters through a range of emotions--anger, worry, fear, doubt, determination, love. Central is the relationship between the two characters and the journey it takes in all its ups and downs. Here, I thought Damon and Affleck did a great job, giving their characters nuances that indicated they were friends that knew each other well. Throughout the cinematography is superb and certainly innovative. Though some scenes may be trying for some viewers (think of the scene in Lawrence of Arabia where Omar Sharif approaches from afar riding a camel), the shots are full of intensity and are visually creative. For me, the movie was a brave and largely successful attempt to give insight into a life-changing experience. I thought about it for days after.",

      "reviewBody": "Frank Capra knew that Gary Cooper was made for the part of Longfellow Deeds, he waited until Harry Cohn could get him from Paramount before making this film. It certainly is a once in a lifetime role and it got Gary Cooper his first nomination for Best Actor. He lost that year to Paul Muni for The Story of Louis Pasteur. But Capra won for Best Director that year.\n\nCooper, poet laureate of Mandrake Falls, inherits 20 million dollars from a rich uncle. He&apos;s not terribly impressed with that as he feels he&apos;s living just fine in Mandrake Falls. But he goes down to New York City to settle the estate and gets put up in grand style at his late uncle&apos;s mansion. \n\nThe executor of the estate, Douglass Dumbrille, is one smooth talking, white shoe bottom feeder. This is probably Dumbrille&apos;s best known classic villain, John Cedar. He wants Cooper&apos;s power of attorney real bad to cover up some dipping he&apos;s done. Cooper isn&apos;t giving it to him right away though.\n\nIn the meantime his inheritance has become news and local editor George Bancroft has dispatched sob sister reporter Jean Arthur to invade his inner sanctum. That&apos;s a common thread in the Capra populist trilogy, a woman sent to invade the inner sanctum of the hero and ends up falling for him. Jean Arthur did it again to James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Cooper had it done to him again by Barbara Stanwyck in Meet John Doe.\n\nAfter a whole lot of silly incidents which Arthur duly reports on, Cooper gets a real wake up call from one of what the current president then called a forgotten man. John Wray, a desperate farmer, tossed off his land and there were plenty of those in the twenties and thirties tells him off good and proper in a very powerful scene. Cooper, his own values questioned, decides to set up a fund to save the family farm as an institution. \n\nThen he&apos;s called insane and Dumbrille takes as clients other heirs who want to contest the will. Which leads to Cooper&apos;s hearing in court to determine his sanity.\n\nThe values of Mr. Deeds are certainly eternal, honesty and decency don&apos;t and should never go out of style. Unfortunately the family farm is a thing of the past, there are less and less of them every year. It&apos;s agribusiness now so a faithful remake could never work today.\n\nYet the original still has a charm that cannot be denied, due to Frank Capra&apos;s vision and the way he got great performances out of the whole cast. One performance that shocked me was Raymond Walburn who usually plays avuncular, loquacious types. He plays the butler to Cooper&apos;s uncle and now to Cooper himself. To those who expect the usual Walburn we know and love, this is one different Walburn.\n\nEven though Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is rooted firmly in the Thirties it should still be seen and studied today.",

Carl McCoy from Fields Of The Nephilim was involved in this movie. First of all, he was the voice of the evil spirit, second, a song from the Fields appeared on the credits, Darkcell. Carl once played an important role in Hardware which was a good movie but here it&apos;s back to square one. The story itself is okay but the movie is a bit boring. Cheap effects are used to cover the low budget. It never becomes frightening or scary and it fails in so many ways. There&apos;s a lot of talking and weird things going on, like the special hand, Mad Max style. A shame that this project wasn&apos;t worked out better, it would have given us a better &apos;sign&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "There were hundreds of these cheap-ish World War Two quickies in the decade following the close of the conflict itself. They differed little from those produced during the war, still being in a kind of adulatory propagandistic mode, except that they were a little more vague usually having no direct message. What&apos;s more, as more time went by the seemed to get further and further from the realities of the conflict.\n\nAn American Guerrilla in the Philippines sees Tyrone Power, swashbuckling idol of the pre-war years, as an officer battling Japs in the Philippine jungle. Power has matured as an actor since his pictures a decade earlier, appearing tougher and less boyish, although he has also become less interesting in the process. His performance is steady and natural, but he is unable to make anything of what is admittedly a rather bland character on paper anyway. His buddy Tom Ewell is an unusual addition to the cast. He was in later years a very fine comedy actor, but it&apos;s hard to tell if he&apos;s appearing here as comic relief or not. In some moments, such as his burbling in the water trying to stay afloat, seem as if he is trying to play them for laughs, inappropriately if so, and certainly not at all funny. The rest of the cast is simply plain bad or plain boring.\n\nDirector Fritz Lang is normally someone who can give a nice baroque touch to even the most American of film formats, while still remain true to genre and tone. He seems uncertain however quite what to do with this one. He gives many shots in the jungle an abstract feel, with no familiar points of reference, giving them a threateningly wild look. Often his camera takes a spectator&apos;s position, peeping out through foliage. It&apos;s hard to tell what purpose this serves, as it distances us from the events on screen. Incidentally, Lang was a very good director of crowds and action, as evidenced in his big-budget silent pictures. There are some very powerful moments, with characters moving straight towards us down the middle of the shot and memorably stylised movements. However for a director who is normally so good at imbuing his work with a dark and nightmarish feel, An American Guerrilla in the Philippines has none of the bleak terror of, say, Operation Burma, a picture which really worked because it made us the audience feel lost within the jungle ourselves.\n\nAnd ultimately An American Guerrilla in the Philippines is too light, and too sparing on any true sense of tragedy. It&apos;s lack of a real feeling of danger gives it many dull stretches, and its lack of realism does a disservice to those involved in the conflict. All of which is rather odd because the picture is also far from being a comedy. The only thing which saves it and makes it watchable is Fritz Lang&apos;s strong, vibrant imagery, such as dozens of hats waving in the air or a soldier&apos;s dying scream just inches from the lens. Having said that, there are far better Fritz Lang pictures to see these brilliant touches in.",

      "reviewBody": "Upon hearing theories that Atlantis wasn&apos;t buried in the sea but rather under the sands of the Sahara Desert, the French send two army officers by the names of &quot;Captain Morhange&quot; (Gustav Diessl) and &quot;Lieutenant Saint-Avit&quot; (John Stuart) to try to locate it. Unfortunately, once they get close to their destination the tribesmen they hired betray them and turn them over to the evil queen of Atlantis named &quot;Antinea&quot; (Brigitte Helm). Surprisingly, Queen Antinea falls madly in love with Captain Morhange while at the same time Lieutenant Saint-Avit becomes attracted to her. But because he is a loyal French officer, Captain Morhange is more concerned about the health and welfare of his subordinate and this results in severe consequences for both of them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is one of those old and rare films that is probably better appreciated from an historical perspective than from a more modern context. Yet even with certain allowances made it is still undermined by the rather bizarre plot and abrupt script. Of course, the fact that it was translated into three different languages (English, German and French) no doubt affected that to an extent. In any case, although it was not without its flaws I still found the movie to be somewhat entertaining and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

This movie could have easily have had a sequel, such as going back for the gold through a mountain crevasse. One of Mr Heston&apos;s finest performances. My first introduction to Kim Bassinger, and she remains as my favorite blonde bombshell actress. We are also biting at the bit to get it on DVD.

This is the story of a young woman who decides to get out of town because there is no future there. She lives with her dying stepmother, her real mother leaving her behind for 18 years. She just kind of flits through things because she has pretty much been adored. She is impetuous. I haven&apos;t seen such a tear jerking woman as her loving stepmother, maybe Mrs. March in little women. She goes to be a hair stylist and gets hooked up with some bad ones, including a wolfish playboy. Meanwhile some big lunk with a silly name, Ulfe, carries a torch for her. In fairness, it has lots of very good shots and is pretty polished for a first film. It&apos;s just a bit dull and silly and very predictable.",

The movie gives a realistic description of the daily life of ordinary people in Brooklyn. \n\nBrooklyn has the star role. In fact the movie seems like a declaration of love to this city, although when compared to Woody Allen&apos;s &quot;Manhattan&quot;, the approach is completely different.\n\nThe message is in a way surprising (maybe because of my European bias): Even in this money driven, rough, fast living, time-is-money, urban and individualistic environment there is a lot of love, friendship and humanity. Humanity means also that we do things which eventually do not make very much sense, are not logical and which may be very emotional. Smoking belongs to such activities. It is an activity which needs a work break. It gives us an opportunity for a stop and for starting rethinking issues. Therefore the small cigar shop, which appears like an island within a stormy ocean, like the antipode to the bustle environment.\n\nSometimes some of the hurry enters the shop, but the clocks seem to tick differently there and at the end everything calms down. I like this movie.",

Kevin Spacey does an admirable job with the difficult role of Quoyle, he is shot from strange angles to emphasize a height and width that is not there in real life.  I had envisioned Gerard Depardieu in the role, big, hulking and awkward. I note also that one of the daughters was dropped from the movie, there are two in the book. Judi Dench&apos;s performance is incredible and her tough almost fatalistic Newfoundland character feels real.  Moore is a disappointment, far too beautiful for the role and not as mysterious as depicted in the book.  The scenery is incredible, wild and isolated.  I enjoyed the soundtrack and the minor characters, all very well acted.  I gave it an 8  out of 10 for the fabulous cinematography and Judi Dench.",

      "reviewBody": "A strange movie. Seems like Curt Goetz couldn&apos;t quite decide whether to make a comedy or not out of his play because there&apos;s a whole lot of melodrama around. In the face of two world wars, Professor Prätorius, a philanthropist and a surgeon, wants to exterminate the one danger to mankind, the microbe of stupidity, as he states in a spontaneous lecture to his male and female students. Later in that speech he utters what great a gift it is to women to have children (enthusiastic acclaim from all listeners). - One of the oddest takes here has Prätorius unnecessarily derobe the corpse of a young woman down to her waist, a seldom-seen example of nudity in early German post-war cinema.\n\nStory proceeds in the same erratic manner, with rather rare swings to the comic side. The parts with the pregnant woman who attempts suicide and the valet who had been sentenced to death before are not funny at all, but serious to the core. They could, in fact, include some unusual statements on abortion, unmarried motherhood and death penalty but that might just as well be way out of the storyline. There is no nightshift stress or professional errors, on the contrary, Prätorius has time enough to conduct a student orchestra (the conducting scenes unfortunately add some self-admiring pathos).\n\nThe sound quality is not so good, due to the pic&apos;s 50 years of age, but camera work (Fritz Arno Wagner) is very satisfactory. Bruno Hübner is a sight to see as Shunderson, a rôle which might likewise have been played by Fritz Rasp (as it was in the remake fifteen years later). Valérie von Martens (Goetz&apos; real-life wife) and Erich Ponto give proofs of their versatility. (By the way, that&apos;s an uncredited Horst Tappert who hands Martens her purchases in a five-second appearance during the surprise photograph of Hübner.)\n\nWe have a lot of learned uprightness in the story of &quot;Frauenarzt&quot;, generating with a well-off doctor, paired with some funny ideas, but it leaves you unsatisfied: a strange movie."

So in _La Messa_ I was surprised to see a bitter, angry, and quite selfish Moretti in the role of a suburban priest who seems--much like the psychoanalyst of _The Son&apos;s Room_--utterly incapable of helping those who put themselves in his care. \n\nThere&apos;s lots to like in this movie: the somewhat decrepit but nonetheless lovely settings around Rome, the nods to other great Italian movies (Moretti, in his cassock, playing soccer with the school kids, calls to mind Rossellini&apos;s _Rome, Open City_), the intense and largely convincing story. I found particularly compelling a courtroom confrontation involving a judge, a defendant, and Moretti&apos;s priest as a witness. I was, on the whole, moved by Moretti&apos;s take on the priest&apos;s dealings with his brothers-in-arms from what were presumably their days as leftist activists.\n\nOn a final note, people are always comparing Moretti to Woody Allen. I don&apos;t see why. Their movies have almost nothing in common. I have never seen Allen as anything more than a second-rate standup comic, or as a caricature. Moretti, on the other hand, is a human being.",

      "reviewBody": "The escort company travels across the countryside during the opening credits. The home they arrive at seems abandoned. Chiang Pin is upset and the flashback explains he misses Chang Ching-Ching. Cut to a gang of thugs on the street push around a kid. He resists so they kill the boy and his mother. Cut again to the Chinese Opera. The big shots argue and Chen Hung-Lieh comes out on top. He insists the opera troop leave because he doesn&apos;t like them but wants to bed the girl. A fight breaks out and he is killed by electrocution. As the troop ponders what to do next his gang surrounds the theater to kill all of them. They escape but the girl is held hostage until they turn over the man responsible, or until she goes to bed with the new bad guy.\n\nThe fights are short, a good thing because they are not good. There is no focus, no power, same moves over and over, too close, too many short cuts - all the problems typical of poor fight choreography. The story line did not hold my attention and needed to fast forward through half of just to technically take credit for watching it.\n\nIF you manage to watch this movie to about the 30 minute mark there is a memorable moment for the hard core fan of martial arts movies of the golden age from 1967 to 1984. The actor Got Siu-Bo (a.k.a. Ko Hsiao-Pao and about six other names) fights. Got Siu-Bo is an easily recognizable and one of my favorite character actors from this movie era. He has a remarkable 292 film credits. What is remarkable is that because of his body habitus he is always cast as the fat guy. I have noticed from watching so many of these movies that he is capable of so much more and whenever he was given the chance to actually act he rose to the occasion and stole the scene. See my other reviews for particulars. In this scene he leads his brothers to recover their master&apos;s corpse. He fights briefly and dies a good death.\n\nMy copy is a digital file that plays as widescreen (but not true widescreen) with Arabic over English subtitles on a HDTV.",

      "reviewBody": "Wayne&apos;s World (1992)\n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nHighly entertaining big-screen version of the Saturday Night Live skit has best buds Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) partying and doing their public television show without much stress in their lives. This all changes once they meet up with a crooked producer (Rob Lowe) who decides to exploit their show. WAYNE&apos;S WORLD isn&apos;t one of the greatest movies ever made but it&apos;s certainly charming and funny enough for what it is. I&apos;d also say it&apos;s safe to say that this is one of the better SNL transitions to the movies and a lot of the credit has to go to its two stars. I think both Wayne and Garth would be downright annoying characters had the performances been off in any way but both Myers and Carvey really took these guys and made them, at times, stupid but also very charming and just the type of people you&apos;d want to hang out with. There are all sorts of funny moments throughout the picture but the real highlights deal with the boys and their interactions with other people. Lara Lynn Boyle as Wayne&apos;s ex-girlfriend gets all sorts of funny moments as does Brian Doyle-Murray who ends up being a sponsor who gets on the wrong side of Wayne. There&apos;s also Ed O&apos;Neill in a small role as well as Meat Loaf and Chris Farley. Also on hand is a terrific bit from Alice Cooper who nearly steals the film with the performance of &quot;Feed My Frankenstein&quot; and the hilarious backstage access where he talks about Milwaukee. Lowe also deserves a lot of credit with his comedy here as he&apos;s perfect as the snake in the grass. Even Tia Carrere does a nice job. Director Penelope Spheeris does a very good job at keeping the film moving at a very good pace and there&apos;s no question that she knows how to stage the various bits of classic rock music throughout. Fans of the SNL material are certainly going to eat this up as its as fresh today as it was when it was first released."

As Aliens from Outer Space are slowly switching places with real humans . One of the first switching is an attractive young (Tom Tryon) about to get wedded to a beautiful girl called Marge (Gloria Talbott). One year marriage later she still feels there are numerous rare things about him , as he doesn&apos;t have feelings , nor emotions. A horrified Marge then attempts to warn everyone of the alien threat . \n\nIt&apos;s a typical B movie of the 50s , it has suspense , thriller , tension and fun . Tom Tryon as the alien husband is fine and Gloria Talbott as his distrustful wife is enjoyable , she usually was in sci-fi films by that time . There appears a very secondary role , Ty Hardin , who along with Tom Tryon were two beefcakes who habitually played movies for youth . In fact , the scene at the beach gave movie audiences their first look at Ty Hardin&apos;s bare chest . Special effects , FX , are average , though by that time were quite well ; they are in charge of John P.Fulton , a craftsman with great experience and a long career from the silent cinema . Production design by Henry Bumstead who has worked along with Alfred Hitchcock (Vertigo, Topaz) and today continues , being Clint Eastwood&apos;s usual set decorator (Unforgiven , Mystic river) . However , the sets in aircraft interior are ridiculous and embarrassing . The motion picture was regularly directed by Gene Fowler Jr , he was a famous editor and occasionally director of Western as ¨The Oregon Trail¨ and terror as ¨I was a teenage wolf¨ . The flick will appeal to science fiction and fantastic movies fans . Rating : Mediocre but amusing .",

      "name": "Some Like It Hot - The Classical Comedy",
      "reviewBody": "There is always a thing about Classics, even before you absorb the first frame; you are burdened with huge expectations. But, Some Like It Hot is one of those jet planes where you got to tight your seat belt and forget everything else to enjoy the joyride or you would fall off your seat.\n\nI feel casting in a movie is one of the most under discussed elements of movie making amongst general public but it plays a very significant role in the success of a movie and SLIH is the prime example of it. Apart from Jack Lemmon, none of the protagonists were known for their superior acting skills and they would not have made the cut for a Billy Wilder piece. But, in retrospect, who other than Tony Curtis who had a boyish look and at the same time possessed sharp features could have played a saxophone playing woman charmer who could cross dress to be a part of a woman band. You can only get a flawless performance from a bad actor only if he/she is playing himself/herself and that is the exact reason why Marilyn Monroe wows you in every scene of Some Like It Hot. She is playing a dumb, vivacious and vulnerable damsel who can sing, doesn&apos;t mind sleeping with a charming guy whenever she gets a chance and then dips herself in a whiskey bottle when left all alone with herself. Jack Lemmon with a broad muscular jawline was surely the one who had a better chance of getting caught as someone not in the right clothes, but that is very small price to pay, as an actor of his caliber was indispensable to the cause of SLIH. He has an amazing sense of timing when it comes to humor; he is almost chaplinesque when it comes to expressions and the confidence with which he delivers his lines puts him right at the top of stack.\n\nI am not sure when was the concept of black humor introduced in the world of cinema, but, SLIH has to be one of the better examples from the old times where black humor is integrated in the comedy. The black humor is there only to make its presence felt and nothing more. Other than that SLIH is a fun filled journey of Gerald (Lemmon) and Joseph (Curtis), two musicians on the run from dangerous Chicago gangsters who are after their lives. They find their safe house in an all-woman band that is off to Florida for a string of performances. This is where they meet the gorgeous Sugar (Marilyn) and try their luck on flattering her. It is all about how Joseph manages to get ahead in the race and Gerald like a true friend tags along without any explaining or pleading by Joseph. This is what makes SLIH sweet. The necessary salt is added to the movie by little moments like women having a party on train, Sugar hiding whiskey in her stocking, Fielding (Joe Brown) hitting on Dalphe (Gerald disguised as a woman) and further complications that set in because of these. What makes this classical comedy special is the fact that it makes you laugh at so many occasions without being slapstick or cheap or using the chaos technique. And when it doesn&apos;t make you laugh, it makes you smile. Most importantly, the movie stays with you.\n\nThe manner in which the movie begins, it suddenly makes you wonder - that&apos;s too much of real car chasing and shooting for a black and white movie of 40&apos;s and then you realize it&apos;s done in 1959 and the movie was intentionally produced in black and white. The first scene itself is a cracker and will create a cocktail of emotions, with words like liquor, crime, party, death, music all floating around at the same time. There are plenty of scenes where the camera pans out from one object to another capturing multiple things with different moods and complexion in the same scene and that is a technique which I guess wasn&apos;t used quite frequently back then. Make-up job of Curtis and Lemmon is too good for those times and it would have been so important for that to have been correctly done as that is absolutely central to the whole plot. Marilyn&apos;s costumes are way modern and she carries them effortlessly.\n\nSome Like It Hot is without any doubt a classic but, probably in no other movie would have the last line played such an important role as in this. The finishing frames where Joe Brown utters the unexpected leave you pleasantly surprised and I am sure it would have had far better impact on the audience 50 years back.",

      "reviewBody": "In my estimate the film isn&apos;t as bad as the comment of Jan Onderwater suggests. It has some great moments and colorful details, for instance the set decorations. The crazy director of the mental hospital, cracking matches all the time to get his nervousness under control, is sitting in front of a painting, that instantly makes you laugh: a big red splash like blood on a white canvas. The hallways and rooms of the hospital are equipped with psychedelic and op-art paintings and you ask yourself, whether they decorate the interior of the institution or rather create the madness going on inside it. All in all the film is about the eternal question, who is crazier, the lunatic or the society he lives in. The performances of the actors is not consistent. Sometimes the two stars of the film, Heinz Rühmann and Charles Régnier, act quite brilliantly, sometimes they look kind of misplaced, but obviously owing to a weak director&apos;s leading rather than to their own abilities. The weak sides of the film include severe mistakes of timing, for instance in many of the hunt scenes, and a lack of sense for the increase and decrease of dramatic suspense. Still the film is a child of its time in the best sense and therefore has its true value, although it is far from perfect.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday&apos; is far from picture, but when I compare it to the ones I have seen (2, 3, 4, parts of 5 and 6, 8) it isn&apos;t that awful.\n\nThe film is far from scary. I saw the unrated version and only jumped when someone knocked on my window. So if you are in for something to keep you out of your seat rent &apos;Scream.&apos;\n\nBut I liked it because I enjoy gore. It makes the first fifteen minutes of &apos;Scream&apos; become tame. This movie is hardcore, especially the director&apos;s cut (which is available.) It is not for a weak stomach.\n\nSo you might as well try it out. I think you will enjoy it."

      "reviewBody": "Review By Kamal K\n\nLaila Majnu&quot; offers within its 19 reel, lavish sets, glittering desert exteriors, an elaborate fantasy sequence, and gorgeous costumes. It all makes for an eye-catching pageant, except that the pageant often looks closer to being a comedy than a tragic tale of star-crossed lovers. For a tale of intense love and hate, director H. S. Rawail&apos;s film generally strikes incongruous notes.\n\nThe lovers&apos; first meeting in the market place promises a forceful depiction of the first stirring of love, but, the sequence peters out when you see Kais (Rishi Kapoor) appearing and disappearing as if by magic. Later, during his nocturnal visits into Laila&apos;s (Ranjeeta) bedroom, he recites verses like one who was doing it without knowing the meaning of the lines.\n\nNext, there is the fantasy sequence, which turns out to be an exercise in matching naive visuals with pedestrian lyrics (written by Sahir Ludhianvi). The lovers&apos; silent meeting at the Dargah captures for a moment the intensity of their love. Perhaps part of the effectiveness of the scene is due to the fact that it comes close, on the heels of a particularly loud &apos;qawwali&apos; with Kais making a full throated contribution-although you have earlier seen him wandering in the desert for days without food or water.\n\nIf the film fails to capture the intensity of love, it fails equally in projecting the hostility between the respective families of the lovers - the main cause behind the tragedy. The violent confrontations which should have been telling omens of the impending doom, are reduced to clowning by Kais&apos;s friends (Asrani, Paintal, etc.). The last duel between Kais and Tabrez (Ranjeet), Laila&apos;s brother, borders on a caricature.\n\nRanjeeta makes a convincing Laila, despite being a bit heavy with her dialogue and she manages aided by effective makeup to provide a measure of pathos in her later scenes. Rishi Kapoor as Majnu-Kais is effective in serious moments but looks awkward during the song sequences. As the prince who marries Laila, Danny turns in a sympathetic performance.\n\nThe music is unimpressive with the exception of Koi Pathar sai na marey and so is the dialogue which keeps swinging between Urdu and Hindustani, occasionally threatening to lapse into Bombay Hindi.",

Here in a great titled flick, he&apos;s a framed escapee, made a psychotic patient, that has him now masquerading as a hectic doctor. But the jobs does have it&apos;s perks, with Pryor examining a young hottie&apos;s goodies, one standout scene in the whole mad affair. This film is very entertaining, though, as in seeing how Richie will get out of this. The film has a very interesting cast, including a bit part with Wesley Snipes as an ambo, and Joe Mantegna, has a heartless, hospital director, who&apos;s taken a hostage by our loonies. The cast on the patient&apos;s arm scene with Pryor laying the cast on pretty thick, with Pryor showing a young intern, was another funny moment. As was too, him trying to convince the hospital board of his psychotic state, when he describes in unsavoury and disturbing detail, pictures that our show to him. The film&apos;s not unfunny. It&apos;s just not as funny as most of Pryor&apos;s stuff, where as you know, with his films, the bar is set pretty high. It&apos;s still bloody enjoyable, the &quot;what a shame factor&quot; present. Again in the end, it all ends well, for our framed ex con/conman, Pryor. Still one for Pryor fans.",

      "reviewBody": "In my brief, initial review of &apos;Kill Bill Vol. 1.&apos; I made the regrettable mistake of dismissing it as exceedingly pleasing yet unsubstantial stylistic masturbation, lacking the profundity and characterizations of Tarantino&apos;s previous works. Rarely have I been happier to be proven wrong.\n\nWhat once seemed like somewhat incoherent cinematic recklessness has, after viewing the second part of Mr. Tarantino&apos;s saga, revealed itself to be wild, imaginative and brilliant filmmaking. As a whole, &apos;Kill Bill&apos; is utterly unified (not despite but because of the radical shift in tone), possesses a strong, dramatic ark, and, above all, stands as quite possibly the most passionate, loving tribute to cinema I have ever seen. While part one pays homage to Brian De Palma, Dario Argento and the Shaw Brothers, part two cites, among many others, Jean-Luc Godard, Sergio Leone, and Robert Siodmark.\n\nBut that&apos;s far from all.\n\nIn his critical essay &apos;The Cinema of the Cool&apos;, Kevin Murphy suggests that Tarantino must move on and grow up to fully realize his potential as a filmmaker. In my opinion, with this piece, he has done so. Those merely seeking the blood-splattered, broken-bone action of Vol. 1 will be severely disappointed by Vol. 2, which is infinitely more thoughtful, pondering the nature of violence, both in cause and effect. While the action in the first installment was great, comic book fun, here it becomes severely unpleasant, cringe inducing, and never without consequence. If anything, it reminded me of the great Akira Kurosawa&apos;s work. Remarkable."

      "reviewBody": "This is pretty much the typical romantic comedy, but with an interesting twist; the main character has the ability to hear womens thoughts. The important thing was that for it to work, the character would be placed in a lot of interesting comical situations, where you could laugh at it, without it being too mocking of womens thoughts, or too far-out to enjoy. It succeeds pretty well, however the way the character gains and loses the ability were handled somewhat poorly. The humor is good, and there is plenty of it, throughout the entire runtime. The characters were believable, and the main character eventually grew to be likable. The plot was good, and the acting likewise. The only thing that brings the movie down, is the poor execution of the gain/loss of the ability to hear womens thoughts, and the sugar-sweet ending, that was too predictable and plain boring, as anyone who&apos;s seen one of the hundreds(possibly thousands) of romantic comedies out there. No actual new stuff brought to the table, apart from the interesting and original concept of a man being able to hear what women are thinking. OK for a romantic comedy. 7/10",

The FBI investigates which reveals Wayne&apos;s ongoing affair. Eventually Arnold demands a ransom.\n\nThe movie lacks the normal intensity. It&apos;s filled with a lot of the inbetween moments. It&apos;s a style that keeps the tension simmering at low. There are great actors here and it&apos;s fascinating to see them interact. There is also a timeline split going on. It&apos;s a great idea but it needs some more thought on its execution. This movie just needs greater intensity.",

Martin Sheen is very good as a police psychologist who moves to New York with his son after his wife&apos;s bizarre death, and must deal with the very strange doings occuring around him. The fine cast includes a younger Jimmy Smits, Robert Loggia, Helen Shaver, and Harley Cross. Director John Schlesinger provides good shocks, and good the movie has a fine late 80&apos;s New York feel, even though most of it was filmed in Toronto!",

Nevertheless, Sonja Henie, &quot;Queen of the Ice,&quot; became one of the biggest box office attractions of her time as a result of the 12 movies she made between 1936 and 1948. You owe it to yourself to see at least one of these films, none of which are really musicals but which often include a lot of great music. Arguably the best of her figure skating extravaganzas is &quot;Second Fiddle,&quot; the story of a Minnesota school teacher whose talent takes her to Hollywood. Sound familiar? Henie was from Norway and was discovered after winning three Olympic gold medals. The Irving Berlin score and the performances of Tyrone Power, Rudy Vallee, Mary Healy, and Edna Mae Oliver are more good reasons to watch this film. And they were right about Henie; you can&apos;t keep your eyes off her. If you like what you see, give a try to One in a Million (1936) in which Borrah Minevitch and His Harmonica Rascals provide the laughs. --Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",

      "reviewBody": "Mauro Bolognini&apos;s most critically acclaimed film is far from his best. A tale of a &apos;working class hero&apos; in turn-of-the-century Florence, it seems fundamentally unsuited to this director&apos;s world view. Most of Bolognini&apos;s films take place in an aesthetic and rather camp universe ruled by powerful and glamorous women (Claudia Cardinale in La Viaccia, Gina Lollobrigida in Un Bellissimo Novembre, Dominique Sanda in The Inheritance) who hold effortless sway over effete and malleable men.\n\nYet this film of Vasco Pratolini&apos;s novel was Bolognini&apos;s pet project for nearly a decade. If he had managed to cast Albert Finney (as he hoped to do in 1963) the character and his story might have a shade more conviction. But pretty-boy pop star Massimo Ranieri barely seems capable of reading his lines off a cue card, never mind digesting huge chunks of Das Kapital. Faced with the inadequacy of his male lead, Bolognini does what he has always done - and lets the women rule the film.\n\nThe least interesting woman, by far, is Metello&apos;s saintly wife Ersilia (Ottavia Piccolo). A salt-of-the-earth proletarian Madonna figure, she keeps her husband in line largely by boring him (and the audience) into a state of submission. Piccolo is an actress of minimal charisma, and her Best Actress award from the 1970 Cannes Film Festival has to be one of life&apos;s great mysteries. Far more amusing is Tina Aumont as Idina - the couple&apos;s frivolous and flirtatious neighbour. We wait for the inevitable to happen, and of course...\n\nEarly on in the film, Metello has a fling with Viola - a sensual middle-aged school teacher played by Lucia Bose. As usual, Bose is stunning but has far too little to do. One of the screen&apos;s great wasted natural resources, Bose has the magnetism of a Garbo - but she also has a maddening tendency to retire for decades at a time. Given roles as limited as this one, who can really blame her?\n\nAs always in a Bolognini film, the visuals in Metello are flawless. The camerawork by Ennio Guarnieri evokes old photographs of the period. The sets and costumes (supervised by Piero Tosi) are almost eerie in their perfection. Midway through, the cast enjoy a night out at a music hall and the film springs to life - as Bolognini finally gets a chance for a bit of flamboyance, which is what he does best. \n\nSorry, but I can&apos;t get excited about Metello. Its appeal, I suspect, is largely to those who do not enjoy Bolognini&apos;s other and better work. Still, it&apos;s one of his easier films to come by. Fans of arty Italian cinema must take our pleasure where we can get it!"

      "reviewBody": "The main problem with &apos;Captain Corelli&apos;s Mandolin&apos; is that it focuses primarily on the romance between Corelli and Pelagia and that too is half-baked. What is it that draws Pelagia towards him is too unclear. Is it just his musical talent or his zest? The film is set against the backdrop of a war between the Germans and Italians in a Greek island but the war is given less significance and what we see appears very sketchy. The entire film appears too sketchy, melodramatic and clichéd. Much of it is also historically inaccurate.\n\nOn the technical front it is well executed. The cinematography of the beautiful exotic locations is breathtaking. The score is terrific. Where acting is concerned, Penelope Cruz can&apos;t seem to lose her Spanish accent (she&apos;s playing a Greek character) but her performance is otherwise wonderful. John Hurt and Christian Bale are equally marvelous. Nicolas Cage is a miscast. His Italian accent, energetic personality, overdone non-verbal gestures all yield to a caricature rather than a character.\n\nPerhaps director John Madden was pressured to fit the entire novel into a two hour period and he chose to focus on the romance more to draw a larger crowd. I can&apos;t shake the feeling that perhaps someone like Anthony Mingella would have made a better and more complete film of it."

Even the score is really good (I am not sure if both John Williams and Frederick Hollander borrowed or it was just Williams who borrowed form Hollander for Star Wars). I grew fond of Roland Coleman through this movie, he is simply debonair. Sure, the preaching toward the end of the movie is a bit thick, but it is in character and should you listen closely you would find that the message is as relevant today as then. And about the love triangle plot It keeps you guessing till the last moment (only one other movie successfully does the same: Casablanca). Talk of the Town is an intelligent and endearing mix of comedy and drama, it does not use comedy only for the introduction but keeps it up, in parallel to the drama, well through the movie; in that it is remarkable. To say the least it did not deserve to be forgotten, for it does what movies do best: give you a good time.",

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps the real reason why &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; is not as popular as the first film of the series is because most people are more familiar with the butchered and dubbed English version titled &quot;Gigantis the Fire Monster&quot;. However, when you look at that disaster of a film and compare it to Toho&apos;s original Japanese version, with no dubbing, no narration, no music or sound effect changes, you have one of the best 1950s monster movies. &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;, or &quot;Godzilla&apos;s Counterattack&quot; as its original title literally translates, is a flawed film. But like the first Godzilla, it&apos;s an allegorical classic. It symbolizes a different kind of horror that wasn&apos;t expressed in the first film.\n\nThe original 1954 classic &quot;Godzilla&quot; symbolized the horrors of nuclear war and the way that it can ultimately change the lives of people forever. &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; focuses on a different perspective. It symbolizes the struggles of people still trying to adapt to life after a war and recover and try to resume their normal lives again. Godzilla and his very first opponent, Anguirus, are like weapons of war. They strike, cause enormous damage, leave ruins, and the people have to rebuild and try to get back on line again, until the weapons of war come back to attack them again. And the people still live in fear of the atomic bombs and other nuclear weapons, for they have brought back more horrors from the past and continue to bring them upon the world. While &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; is nowhere near as powerful and allegorical as the first film, it is still one of my favorite Godzilla films. But once again, only in its uncut and undubbed print.\n\nThe English language version of the film is just another example of why you should never tamper with somebody else&apos;s film. It is an example among other Godzilla films and also Sergio Leone&apos;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, in which the American distributors cut the film down until it wasn&apos;t as compelling. When &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; was distributed, they tore the film apart and changed it all. The most horrendous dubbing of any Godzilla film was put in, there was a lot of narration that ruined the original feeling of the film&apos;s atmosphere. But what was worst of all, they changed the monsters themselves. Godzilla&apos;s name was changed to Gigantis, his dark, chilling roar was changed to Anguirus&apos; roar most of the time. A lot of the great sound effects of the monsters as they fought in Osaka were replaced, as was Masaru Sato&apos;s original music score. It was replaced with stock B-music and for what reason, I do not know why. A lot of other sound effects were changed as well. In the original print, Godzilla&apos;s death ray creates a loud, destructive kind of sound. But in the dubbed version, for reasons unknown, it was replaced with a wispy sound effect, like a leak in a hose.\n\nIgnoring the existence of &quot;Gigantis the Fire Monster&quot;, the special effects used in &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; are very fine for the age. Unfortunately, they weren&apos;t as good as the Japanese Academy Award-winning effects presented in the first Godzilla film. At times, Godzilla&apos;s head and neck seemed too slender and the hand-operated puppet used in the close ups is just plain not good-looking. However, the suits used for Godzilla and Anguirus in their epic, realistic battle in Osaka looked fantastic! And what I loved most about this battle, is that it was a traditional, physical fight. The monsters bite, claw, and slam each other like real animals. Unlike in the future, when the monsters would mostly just bump into each other and fight with &quot;beam wars&quot;. Godzilla&apos;s death ray is more like a last resort kind of weapon, something he uses when he&apos;s got a sense of victory, and spends the rest of his time biting and clawing at Anguirus, who performs the same actions. And unlike in the English version, the monsters don&apos;t continuously roar at each other, they mostly growl and snarl when fighting and roar once they have a brief stand-off every now and again.\n\nBut still, &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;, while it&apos;s an amazing monster film, has its flaws. Mostly, it&apos;s the fact that the monsters of the film do not have a whole lot to do with the story. In fact, Anguirus screen time ends after the first third of the movie is over. Maybe, he could have been used a bit longer for a more effective first appearance into the series. Godzilla himself, while the main plot point of the story, doesn&apos;t get as much screen time and scenes as he should get. The storyline just strays from him after the battle for too long and he doesn&apos;t really get anything else until the ending of the film.\n\nBut that doesn&apos;t mean a whole lot. Yes, &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; is not the most action-packed Godzilla film there is. But it is, in its original version, one of the best monster movies there is. It presents a great symbolic message and should be examined by everybody for this reason. It is a dark compelling film, not as great as the first Godzilla film, but definitely one of the best.",

      "name": "&quot;Find your own meaning&quot;/meaningless thriller with few actual thrills",
      "reviewBody": "The only original idea in this movie is to unapologetically use an actual, on-going and bloody war as a superficial backdrop to a pointless and hackneyed plot. The crew seemed like a good bunch of guys, and I&apos;m sure they had a ton of fun in Morocco filming this. Too bad nobody has done the hard work of coming up with a coherent vision, purpose and narrative; of aligning location, characters and story; of coming up with a meaning or a graceful way of avoiding imposing a meaning; or, at the very least, of making an engaging thriller.\n\nStephanie Martin&apos;s cinematography, however, did make the movie much more bearable. Well-done and beautiful. Even stunning at times.\n\nThe score was quite good as well, I thought.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is very difficult to find in the West.  It&apos;s not on video and you&apos;d probably have to be lucky and find it at a film festival or a revival house.  It&apos;s the first collaboration between director Teshigahara, writer Kodo Abe, and composer Toru Takemitsu, who went on to make the more widely available WOMAN IN THE DUNES and FACE OF ANOTHER.  It&apos;s not quite as strong as WitD but is on par with FoA.  This is a satire about a deserted town who&apos;s inhabitants are ghosts swallowed up by corruption.  Teshigahara&apos;s direction is solid and Takemitsu comes up with another appropriately dissonant score balancing tension and humor.  It&apos;s worth seeing for anyone interested in the three principal collaborators, particularly since opportunities to see it are rare.  Takemitsu in particular could almost single handedly make a movie worth watching."
