These shoes are water resistant for hiking purposes so they don&apos;t breathe as much and my feet tend to run a little warmer - I live in Michigan and cooler days are on the way so this is not a issue to me. Hoka is my go-to shoe brand for comfort for work and everyday. I change out of my work hokas for my street hoka shoe.",

The padding around the butt is also weirdly distracting when you walk around in the tights; you can feel it shift around because it’s so much thicker than the other material. As someone who is sensory-sensitive, these were impossible to wear. Had to return them because they were so itchy, uncomfortable, and distracting. They do seem durable, but if you have issues with scratchy seams, these probably aren’t for you. They’re cute though.",

Originally ordered the Abisko HD Trekking Tights in size small based on both the Fjällräven and other sizing guides. The small were so tight that I couldn&apos;t get them past my knees! So I exchanged them for size Medium which fit much better. However, I find the proportions are a bit &apos;off&apos; in order to keep the reticulated patches over the knees. They are so long in the shins that extra fabric is doubled over in places, yet short in the thighs so I&apos;m often pulling them up. Honestly, I think they&apos;re made for tall, thin and leggy Swedes! That said, the fabric feels really good (comfortable all over and rugged where it should be) and these pants are loaded with features. I love that I don&apos;t have to worry about rock scrambles or working in them. And no PFAS! *note* I tried both the Abisko Pro and the HD and prefer the HD for their more rugged build.",

I have a little more upper body muscle mass than the typical slender racer body type. This requires an XXL jersey but the length of the XXL jersey is better suited for a very tall cyclist (over 6’1”).   So the jersey is too long for me at 5’11”.   It would be great if Castelli would make race fit jerseys for men with some upper body muscle mass and are under 6 foot tall.  If this Jersey were about 1.5- 2 inches shorter it would be perfect in size.",

        "reviewBody": "Got the stratus 36 this summer and have done a number of day hikes with it and it’s been awesome. It has all the bells and whistles of larger packs and this version without the flip lip makes it super easy to get whatever you need out of the pack. I also found it comfortable from the get go and the ventilation back works as well as it can. Thus, for day hiking, it’s a 5/5\n\nOne note I will drop is to not get this bag expecting it to be an all-around bag. I had a talon for 10 years before this guy and that pack worked decently for travel, bike commuting, hiking, and just about everything. The Stratos though is much more specialized of a pack. What I mean is I just travelled to Iceland with the stratos (which I guess the frame is actually too large for carry-on though I wasn’t stopped for it) and I found the bag too bulky and awkwardly shaped to be comfortable in the plane or in public transport. Honestly, in most urban settings it just felt cumbersome which stood out in contrast to when we were hiking and it felt perfect. Thus, if you want this for a day-hiker or maybe even a pack for a fair weather overnighter, it’s great and probably got more of what you need for that setting. If you want it to be an all-around bag, then maybe I’d point you towards the talon. Either way, very happy with it and look forward to hopefully another 10 years of hiking with it before my next Osprey daypack!",

        "reviewBody": "I bought an older version of this bag in 2015 so I am unsure if the quality/build is the exact same. However, I feel compelled to write this review now because it has stood the test of time and it continues to function absolutely perfectly. It is hands down one of the best purchases I&apos;ve ever made. \n\nI am a field scientist by trade and have done a lot of traveling around the world. It lasted through several field camps, a full 2 year Peace Corps service in Zambia, multiple backpacking trips, and functioned as my school backpack. It has been to Iceland, Zambia, Namibia, South Africa, Malawi, Brazil, all around the US, and its about to join me in another backpacking trip around southern Africa. The only evidence that it has been used is all of the dirt it has accumulated over the years, and a severely cracked buckle that I accidentally broke (and the buckle STILL functions). \n\nI am a firm believer in cherishing your things and buying them to last. I hope Osprey still builds their bags in this way because it has become so hard to find companies that produce dependable goods without trapping you in a buying cycle. \n\nHere&apos;s to many more trips and field days!",

There&apos;s so much extra room around the midsection, I could gain 50 lbs and still have room to spare. I&apos;m 5&apos;11&quot; and 175 lbs with a 31-in waist and ordered the medium, which is my size in all other shirts. I&apos;ll give it an extra star because the fabric seems nice, but the fit was absolutely unacceptable for something described as &quot;standard fit&quot;, and I&apos;ll be returning it as soon as I possibly can.",

After 5 days of skiing these bibs will have several rips and cuts along the inside of the ankles where your ski boots might rub together.  The fabric along the inside of the ankles is NOT DURABLE enough for a ski pant.  Everything else about these bibs are perfect... but without durable fabric at the base of the legs that is up to the challenge of ski equipment, these bibs are good for nothing more than general outdoor snow pants.  Helly Hanson has always made great products, but because neither Backcountry or HH will stand behind their warranty on this issue, I&apos;ll never buy from either again.   If you are looking for good ski bibs, spend your money on Arc&apos;Teryx, Marmot, Patagonia or Burton.  \n\n\n\nibs for my son who is an expert skier.",

Despite that, the torso of these bibs was way too tight and pinched when bending even slightly...and that was with no base or mid-layer on.  The legs were a smidge long, but I could have lived with those, if not for the too-tight torso.\n\nThe belt loops are too high at mid-stomach, and the back panel is some sort of soft-shell material, not the burlier fabric of the rest of the bib.\n\nSo, if you&apos;re rail-thin and of slightly above average height or more, these bibs would be perfect for you.

Great adjustment points and the main zipper goes from your chest to where you fly would be - so no awkward bathroom breaks on the mountain.  Great design, awesome look! *Note they are a shell, no insulation (I like that best - just pointing it out) .  I would  recommend!",

It is definitely built well and holds the bikes well but i will saw one flaw is the key used to put the hitch on doesn&apos;t connect to the rack so you just have to remember to bring it or else you won&apos;t be getting the rack on or off the car. That was a huge bummer! I didn&apos;t think that was a good enough reason to pay the extra money for the X model. The one handed operation is seamless we love it! We were deciding between this and the Saris rack and i think we made the right decision. THe delivery was quick and easy great company as well giving the 15% off discount. Just wish we could have waited for black Friday but we needed it sooner.",

Maybe obvious to others, but install the kick lever first, as the rack will not fold and unfold without it. Once its assembled its less than one minute to get on and off your trailer hitch. less than 10 seconds to load and unload bikes. I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t spend the extra $300-400 on the Piston Pro X, as I&apos;m not sure it was worth the lights that integrate into your braking system and turn signal. I have this on a Yukon, and my brake lights and turn signal on my car are much wider than the rack. Otherwise it is the same rack as the Piston Pro X in case anyone is wondering.",

This one sits lower on my car, which means it keeps my brake and turn lights fully visible, but completely obscures my license plate. Fortunately Kuat sells a license place adapter for this very reason (~$50), to keep your car mostly street legal (without lights).\r\nI took my bike to a mountain bike race last weekend and I couldn&apos;t imagine a better experience with hauling my bike around. It&apos;s super fast, easy to use, stable, and hinges between positions in a snap.\r\nThe only things I could give negative reviews on are arguably positive... It&apos;s very heavy, which means it&apos;s a bear to move around but solidly built. And, the lock provided is subpar, but that leaves the flexibility to get any level of lock you prefer to use. I think I&apos;ll get a heavy duty chain lock that I can just store in the trunk.",

        "reviewBody": "As I got an EMTB, lifting and mounting it on the roof rack (and the reverse process) became unpractical/ unsafe especially when I am spent after many miles of ups and downs. I did a lot of research on hitch mount racks and concluded that I wanted a rack with the wing style locking system and chose this Kuat Piston. \r\n\r\nThe rack itself is fantastic as expected but man, Kuat needs some competent packaging engineers. The rack came in a pretty large cardboard box and the box did not have anything to grab for handling and carrying. I felt so sorry about an FedEx driver. It looked like the box was rolled around on the ground as its corners and edges were rounded. When I opened the box (on my driveway), I was shocked to see all the pieces were all over the place in the box. You have been warned.\r\n\r\nApart from that, the rack itself is robust and works great with my bike. It is heavy (~60lbs) and heavier than my bike, so it stays on my car most of the time. The bike still wiggles a bit but that is expected due to the mechanism of the wings and the fact that the bike is not one solid piece (it is. Nice to have the steering capability!). I use Velcro straps to secure each wing and wheel as an added security.\r\n\r\nI wish they used a longer, bar-style wedge instead of the ball at the end of the hitch as the rack can still sway a bit in the receiver.",

        "reviewBody": "Just used my new Thule Subterra 2 Duffel Bag for first time on a week-long trip that included a 3 hour round trip flight.  The duffle bag packs nicely and the doctor&apos;s bag style makes it so much easier to pack as the duffle bag does no collapse when packing.  The top zipper is hidden when closed and the two side connections have magnetic catches that are also hidden when closed.  One side outside pocket has key connector for easy and secure access.  There is also on interior zip pocket and a removable divider that also can store items.  The duffle bag is easy to carry with handles or shoulder strap and fits nicely in the overhead compartment.  The duffle bag is also made from high quality nylon fabric.  This is the perfect travel bag for me as I do not check bags if at all possible.",

With my dropper fully down, my tire does contact the bag on big impacts. With that being said, this is a great bag and the seat attachment design is awesome. The bag doesn&apos;t bounce around at all. I have the smaller 0.5L size and usually fit a tube, CO2, patch kit, multi-tool, levers, zip ties, and chain lube, so I would say it holds more than I expected.",

This served that purpose, however, it does not work well on an MTB with any degree of Rear Travel on playful down hill sections.  I have experienced hitting some rollers where this product catches the rear tire and just rips right off.\n\nThis would probably work very well for rigid bikes, but I would not recommend them for those who love to ride the playful down hill on a full travel MTB.  Luckily I noticed this on some local trails quickly, and I will be selling my used Ortlieb for this reason.",

          "You&apos;re kinda knocking this product where it seems like in your scenario any seat bag would do a lousy job with a mountain bike where the dropper post was all the way down and the bag may hit the rear wheel. If that&apos;s the case then no seat bag would have done a good job for you. \n\nI think this bag and mounting system is terrific but naturally you need to have tire clearance for it."

Using these 4.0 as base layers helps to keep their heat from escaping.  They hold up well through washing and the boys playing/lounging in them after skiing too.  They both have two sets, and I only replace once they are outgrown.  I just wish they came in more colors.",

The rubber feet work on almost any surface and do not slide at all. You can work on your skis virtually anywhere. You don’t need a dedicated work bench or tuning stand which is great.  I use my pool table. \n\nYou can lay the skis in sideways for edge work and they are locked in place. No need to Vice clamps. Can also lay flat top or bottom to work on the top side or bases. Again the skis don’t slide because the stands have ultra grippy rubber on top as well. Holds the skis locked in place.",

While it&apos;s a stiff and supportive shoe, the back is soft giving it a bit of flexibility when smearing is needed. While I would say this shoe is meant for a very specific style of climbing/rock-type, it does have a surprising ability to function well in all-round climbing conditions.",

These shoes are aggressive yet also soft and pretty comfortable. They do, however, run quite small. Think your street shoe size as a starting point. They edge very well (as advertised). Where I was pleasantly surprised was how well they smear and how they stick on awkward (angled foot placements). Along with my La Sportiva Skwamas, these will likely become my go to shoes for steeper routes.",

        "reviewBody": "I am an avid trail runner, and hiker and have owned many trail shoes over the past 5-10 years. These Ultra-Flows although still new (I&apos;ve had them for about a month now) have quickly become my favourite trail runners that I&apos;ve ever owned. \r\nI primarily shop with Salomon, but have also owned trail runners from LA Sportiva and New Balance. All of these shoes have been good over the years and had their own special features that make them enjoyable, but the Ultra-Flows have quickly proven to me that they are tough, very waterproof, lightweight, and have excellent grip. I also love how they lace up rather than use the speed lace system that Salomon uses on many of it&apos;s shoes, as I have found that this breaks easily and doesn&apos;t keep the shoes tight on long runs. \r\nI have ran about 35km in these shoes, all around the mountains of British Columbia&apos;s West Coast, and I also use them for work as an Outdoor Ed. Teacher. They are comfortable and keep my feet dry all day, which is saying something Vancouver. \r\n\r\nAll in all, these shoes are everything I&apos;ve hoped for so far. Would recommend.",

        "reviewBody": "I am primarily a gym climber so I cannot speak on using this shoe on micro foot chips. But for all disciplines of indoor climbing whether it&apos;s toe hooking, heel hooking, or smearing on volumes I would argue this is the GREATEST shoe on the market right now for the price. I climb v10 indoors in a relatively difficult gym (subjective ofc) and have had no issues using the toe edge on small foot holds or smearing. The ridiculous amount of rubber on the upper foot portion makes toe hooking on anything feel like cheating and for heel hooks you have the ribbed heel cup and additional rail that sometimes locks me in so well I get stuck when I heel hook some crimps.\n\nI think the best part of this shoe is that it&apos;s not that arched at the midsole and rather has the forefoot arched to compensate for overhanging foot placement. As a result the arch in the forefoot makes using this shoe much more comfortable for both beginner and advanced climbers. Personally, as someone who is very flat footed this shoe is pretty comfortable even tho I downsized from a 10.5 street shoe to a 9 and would enjoy ven consider going down to 8.5.\n\nNote: coming from the solutions comps, instinct vsr&apos;s, and tenaya oasi&apos;s this shoe gave me a much bigger boost in performance than all three.",

Compared to the 2.0, this new version is less sensitive and does not perch on holds well (I&apos;m sliding a lot after several weeks of using, not a break in issue), they are more narrow, but at the same time are longer. I had to go down a half size from the 2.0 because these newer versions are made longer, but even so, it&apos;s still too long, but can&apos;t go down any more because it&apos;s too narrow.

I own the 23 inches but I can not get floatation with gear which is why they tell you the wt limit is 160.  Fine if you are a smaller guy with no pack.  So this is me walking with a heavy parka, boots, clothing, insulated overpants and a daypack that weighs 4 lbs.  Your on the body gear is heavier than you think. One of my ridiculous but so warm and bear resistant Alaskan Hardgear cordura, down, coyote fur parkas wigh like 7 lbs pre humidity. Factor that all in and I had to get a 26 incher at backcountry as well.  The crampon teeth and side rail teeth (I do a lot of traversing on steeper terrain) are very aggressive and that was what I needed. Between the custom fit of the Boa, its quality and attractiveness, its design - it justifies the price easily.  I found it easier to adjust and the heel straps were of a very good quality. I have a feeling that this product may hit five stars (the 26 inch, the 23 hit 5 for casual walking around as transportation the end of last year...)These straps where the easiest to adjst on my heels. And I own a TSL, I need to take mitts off in -30F-so ease of adjstment in the trail is manditory.  These were my first Atlas&apos;s in a long while and they will not be my last.  I was impressed.",

Other than that it claims to be all terrain snowshoes, unfortunately they broke on the 3rd time I used it. \n\nBarely used them for 10-15 miles of snowshoeing  and the rivets broke when I reached campsite. Not a reliable pair of snowshoes in the mountains. \n\nAlso, backcountry’s warranty support isn’t as great as REI’s, it takes forever to get a response and they say I’m supposed mail the item to manufacturer coz it’s been 3 months since purchase.",

They were decently comfortable right off the bat and didn&apos;t take long to break in at all. They perform really well on overhang problems in the gym but can be used in lots of different situations. The one thing I will say is that the midsole is pretty flexible which makes standing on little footholds for long periods difficult. I&apos;d recommend these, but especially to people who like to boulder indoors.",

Always stays on your head and the synthetic is so cooling and perfect for hot days. However I?ve also backcountry skied A LOT with this hat too. It literally never comes off my head in the backcountry. Going uphill if I?m cold, I put a hood over it. Too hot uphill? Nbd hat is perfect. Downhill? LITERALLY PERFECT because I wear my BD climbing helmet (I don?t remember it?s name, the light one pretty much everyone has) I never have to take the hat off. Helmet fits perfectly over the hat. Which, imo, is the best feature of this hat. No weird little nub on the top like baseball hats. Smooth and streamlined (but also not dorky like some tight cycling hats). TLDR; coolest awesomest hat for literally anything in your adventure life",

The fabric that covers the bill is all stretched and looks like trash. The hat itself is not big enough and just kind of daintily sits on your head, and I have a medium sized, razor shaved head. After a hike I would rinse the salt out with a kitchen sprayer and hang dry. Nothing rough. I wont buy another, and have to question the sannity/motives on any good reviews...\nAfter further unspection, it would seem the kavu rep is bombing the review section with fantastical reviews.",

I was concerned about the length since I’m only 5’2 and I’ve seen reviews online that HH bibs tend to fit long, but they fit perfect! It probably has something to do with the straps because they’re super adjustable. That said, I have to agree with another review that mentioned the placement of the bib/straps were made for someone without a chest. This is not a problem for me. In fact, it’s ideal in my case, but something to consider if you’re well endowed. The only feature I wish it had is an adjustable waist. I could probably fit an XS, but I imagine the mobility would be pretty restricted and I wouldn’t be able to wear thick layers if I need to. Overall, I’m really pleased with my purchase especially at the price point! I can’t wait to test these out!",

I am an athletic build with strong quads and glutes and not much of a waist. I got these in a medium and still have room to layer underneath-not a ton of room but adequate. I do like all the pockets and I gave them a test run in the ever-important ease of making a call to nature and they passed! I will write another review after I&apos;ve used these to give my impressions on how they move and whether or not they keep me warm. But for now, I am extremely happy with them and the price point was even better!",

I&apos;m just frustrated companies don&apos;t make pants for us curvy big thighs and big butt women! I&apos;m 5&apos; tall with a 29 in waist, 43 in low hip, and 24 in thighs. I bought a L and they fit, but it&apos;s a struggle to zip up the thigh so I can&apos;t wear thick layers underneath. I agree with the bucket look of the bib (as I&apos;m smaller up top) but that doesn&apos;t bother me too much, though I do wish the waist were adjustable (but it did keep the snow out). While they feel a little tight on my thighs, there is good mobility and I didn&apos;t feel restricted at all on the mountain. The length on me is hilariously long, but that&apos;s to be expected when short lengths aren&apos;t available. The bib straps are VERY stretchy, wish the straps themselves were a little shorter (because of my height), but due to their stretchiness, I was able to pee in them with all my gear on, so that&apos;s a plus!",

The pockets were great, the material was light, and the elastic on the bib straps was nice to get them off and on. The zipper to get them on and off was a little too far over where if I was still wearing my jacket, I couldn&apos;t zip them back up. If they redesigned the zipper 2 inches closer to the hip I think these would be amazing bibs.",

I don&apos;t even have my skier bum yet and the fit is already an issue.

The hoodie does look a little boxy/bulky, but that doesn&apos;t bother me. The camo print is really nice too, it doesn&apos;t give off tacti-cool bro vibes. The one slight downside I will say is that the material is noisy, so be aware of that.",

        "reviewBody": "I originally bought this bag specifically for the kickstand so whenever I changed camera lenses in the woods on a hike, it wasn’t this awkward, tippy bag on the ground mess that it usually is. I’ve had this bag for probably 18 months now and I’ve used it to do that once. The kickstand is amazing but the bag when loaded and walking around is not as comfortable as my other Osprey packs. The rigid portion of the kickstand that connects to the back panel and suspension does not have enough padding when doing long hikes. It’s at the same spot that the other reviewer said pulls his shirt up. I have that happen as well but it hasn’t bothered me as much to notice. This backpack and the kickstand are far too useful for me to return this. I end up using this bag as a carryon when flying. I’ll have a 16” computer, 12” iPad, mirrorless camera, 2-3 coke can size lenses, NC over the ear headphones, battery pack and cables, and an assortment of other flying necessities. It just eats it all with space leftover for like a light jacket. Being able to set this down anywhere and grab what I want out of it without it falling over is so nice. When I don’t have to wear it for super extended amounts of time, I love this pack. I don’t personally have an issue with the water bottle holders, but it is definitely a two handed operation. I prefer this secure it holds the water bottles over the accessibility since I fly with this more than say walk around a campus with it.",

I don’t spend the time to write reviews often so it must be awful or amazing to get me to spend the time. \n\nThis is amazing. \n\nThe internal compartment can hold 2 laptops and an iPad with keyboard case. \n\nThe water bottle sleeves are deep and hold a good bottle well. \n\nThe front organization is nice. \n\nThe one and only flaw of the bag is the droopy nature when it has stuff in the front organization pocket and super front pocket. Let’s get some interface or palstic ridged pipe here and this bag would earn six stars. \n\nKickstand seems like something a kid would have and adults would not need, and that’s just wrong. I can not say how many times I have slung this off my shoulder into the kickstand mode and it’s just perfect as it stays upright and ready to easy deploy what I need. \n\nCarrying. Look if you know you know and if you don’t get it. The mesh and straps make this float as much as any ruck you’re going to carry and frankly I carry more junk than I need but I get away with it thanks to the carry system. \n\n\nI can’t speak to the water our outdoor cross over nature of this bag as I just use my mini 8 year old osprey which is still going like a tank and soiled me with again the same carriage system this has. \n\n\nLastly I went through no less than 10 bags from various other places to arrive here at this bag. I feel like I did not settle but found home. \n\nCarry with care and enjoy this bag of",

The kickstand feature is just simply the best, I don&apos;t like floppy backpacks. It fits just fine under the seat on airplanes, unless you have it completely stuffed. The frame makes it a little long, so that on some planes it will stick out a little into where your feet are. I am 6&apos;4&quot;, so for me getting anything out of it while on a plane is not happening with my knees in the way. The water bottle pockets are great, I had to use a taller skinnier kleen kanteen that I had, rather than the wider hydroflask, but no big deal. Water bottle pockets are always going to be a tradeoff, do you want it secure so it doesn&apos;t fall out, or do you want to be able to put a bottle back one-handed? You can&apos;t really have it both ways. For me, I want things to be secure, and these are.

        "reviewBody": "This is a mixed bag, unfortunately. In the end, I&apos;ve decided to keep it, but I was really close to returning it. I think what ultimately caused me to settle was that I really appreciated how lightweight it was and how the suspension felt on my back. Here&apos;s what I didn&apos;t like: 1. It has this super annoying thing where, no matter what I&apos;m wearing, it hikes my shirt up and exposes my lower back while I&apos;m walking. This is because of the suspension: all of the weight of the bag sits on two points that contact my lower flanks just above my butt. As I walk, those to points rub up and down on my shirt, pulling it up but not pushing it back down. I&apos;ve found that if I flip the tabs from the belt strap over to cover these points (exposing the smoother fabric on their outsides to my back, rather than the rough mesh of the back panel), it fixes the problem, but then it&apos;s uncomfortable. No winning here; I&apos;m just hoping that eventually the fabric will wear smooth from use and the problem may go away.... 2. I strongly dislike that it only has one compression strap and it&apos;s in the middle of the back. Additionally, that one strap doesn&apos;t have the nice quick-release clips that straps usually have. If you want to adjust it - say to put your water bottle in it -, it&apos;s a two-handed operation on both sides. So not only is it annoying to adjust, but it also just pinches my bag in the middle, leaving the top and bottom to be floppy :( :(. 3. The front zippered compartment is a big pocket with a somewhat small opening. Not a huge deal, but certainly annoying. As I said, in the end, I was happy enough to keep the pack, but just barely. I think if I didn&apos;t love the Osprey brand so much I&apos;d probably have returned it and gotten something else, but they&apos;ve got me hooked.....",

        "reviewBody": "There is a lot to like about this bag for everyday carry. I&apos;ll list out some pros and cons. Pros - Good size for carrying standard tech plus couple garments. My phone fits well in one of the admin compartment stretchy pockets. - Comfortable harness system with exceptionally breathable back panel to keep the sweat down - Stands on its own. (awesome) Cons - Stretchy fabric water bottle pockets are oddly sized, and the compression straps can prevent you from easily slotting in a bottle. I&apos;d rather see fabric matching the exterior of the bag with hidden elastic gussets. - The kickstand becomes less stable for a bag without any weight in the bottom of the main compartment. This can cause it to topple if you have a water bottle and a laptop but not much else. - The lower part of the admin panel has no pockets. Why not use the space? - Packing out the two front pockets can restrict access to items at the bottom of the admin pocket, as they can protrude into the interior space. For example, my tech pouch will sometimes get caught up on the underside of a glasses case or power adapter in the outer pocket. - No secret pockets accessible via the side or back for passports or wallet. Conclusions: This is an attractive bag that straddles the needs of outdoor enthusiasts and everyday commuters. I recently took mine to a tech conference where its ultra-breathable back panel and ability to stand served me well. It has just enough tech organization to get me by, but I could have used more pockets in the admin panel area to have dedicated spaces for a usb power bank and charge adapters. I found the stretchy pockets made it overly difficult to slot water bottles quickly single-handed because they would get tripped up on the compression straps. Also, I found myself wanting a more hidden space for my wallet that would both make it easy to remove and not visible every time I opened the admin space. Overall, it&apos;s still a great bag.",

Had to re-order XXL to fit booty &amp; thighs, but now waist is huge and the length is clownish. We ran out of time to hunt down other options before our kayak camping trip thru 100 Wild Islands, so kept the larger size. They held up well and she was dry and warm with her wool base layer leggings underneath. I’m thinking of starting a paddle clothing line for women. I’m tall and leggy but most women aren’t.

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve owned several of these style bottle filters from a few different brands. I had high hopes for the Lifestraw version, but it has several noticeable shortcomings. First, the filter gets clogged WAY faster than the Kayadyn BeFree version. This one was filtering noticeably slower after just 2 cycles. I was filtering water from a crystal clear river in Northern WI and have filtered water from this river for years and never had this issue so soon. In order to backflush, you&apos;ll need the syringe that they send you, which can easily be lost. Because the intake on the Lifestraw filter is only on the end of it, water is only allowed to enter through a small potion of the filter....and it&apos;s the same with the backflushing. With the Kayadyn version, the filter is open 360 degrees around the filter, so a simple swooshing of the filter in the water will clean it. I must have run 10 syringes worth of water back through this thing and it&apos;s not one bit better. I&apos;ve gotten approx 3 years(hundreds of bottles worth) through my Katadyn before the filter wouldn&apos;t process water any longer. My Lifestraw is almost to that point after a single 3 day trip.",

It’s more wider than I like which fits awkwardly on sides of backpack. It doesn’t fit in front pockets of running vest when bottle is full of water. But I’m still satisfied for its sole function of filtering.",

Great  choice for the price range.  Easier for movement when hiking or enjoying the outdoors-lightweight but has the warmth you need.  Checks all the boxes; I&apos;d rather have this Carhartt then spend money on Northface or Columbia.  This one looks very sharp.   I bought the size Large, which is what I would buy in other brands.\nMany pockets for safe keeping.",

I love the quality and living in an extremely hot and arid desert means you needs to wear clothing that is lightweight and breathable. These fit the bill and I love the nude color. It&apos;s a delicate and beautiful design. I highly recommend trying out their underwear, too! ExOfficio makes great gifts to significant others too. I have small titties and these fit pretty good in an xs, however I think I might go for a small in the future just because I think it might fit a little better.",

I am 5&apos;5, 120 pounds, usually I am order S, S would be a little bit tight look, this time try to order M size, fit perfectly, the design not like the merino wool jacket that curvy, but still could considering a good shape design, also texture not like merino thin and soft, this one because have cotton in it, so it&apos;s a little bit thick, but keep the body very warm , very happy this shopping!",

I was just hoping for a bit more drape and refinement as I have in my 100% merino hoodies from Icebreaker. Between the stiffness and heaviness of the cotton and the boxy cut, this was not a good look or feel for me. I continue my search for a rich navy layer that&apos;s can do double duty over casual pants and slightly dressier skirts and dresses. FWIW, I weigh 185 lbs, and the XL fit well on my 5&apos; 6&quot; height.",

        "reviewBody": "Large and spacious. Large doors in front and smaller one in back was very useful.  Coming from a smaller &quot;4 person tent&quot; (sierra South fork) this was more difficult to put up for one person.   Mainly because the poles are threaded through the top. This Required the tent and poles to be lifted while simultaneously bending them into place eyelets in the corners. Clips to the top might be easier to build the tent. The rainfly has a droop over the main vestibule where rain collects. No leaks observed but it makes entering during rainfall risky. We camped during a bright moon. The kiwi color made the tent seem while on the inside. Drying out took somewhat long due to some of the double over layers (zipper covers, flaps etc) trapping water. Pack size and pole design makes it just too big to be a good packing tent. Good for cars and short carry ins\r\n\r\nSize:5/5\r\nSet up: 4/5\r\nRain resistance: light rain (4/5)\r\nDrying time: 3/5\r\nColor option: 4/5\r\nWind resistance:TBD",

I recently got the Limestone for an weekend camping trip and I love. It was rainy and windy all weekend but my tent stayed bone dry. More than that, I could actually stand in this tent and the walls being so vertical I could actually fit my wife and two kids in it without us rolling over each other all night. Even better its got these great pockets for stashing away your gear. You can tell they really thought out every aspect of this tent.",

I&apos;ve been reading all over the internet what great sandals Chaco makes, and i can see the potential they have, but when I slipped my first pair ever on, my experience was definitely disappointing.  \n\nThe left sandal fit me ok (if not a bit tight).  The right sandal however, gave me problems right away.  The size 9 I received, felt like a size 7.   I know both feet aren&apos;t always matching sizes, but my feet aren&apos;t that wildly different!\n\nI couldn&apos;t figure out why until I broke out the measuring tape and found that the right strap (the one that starts at the pinky-toe and goes to the back arch) is about 1 inch shorter than the one on the left.  These straps are bound to the sole, there is no give.  There is no adjusting it.  \n\nI&apos;ll be returning these.  Z/2 9M",

        "reviewBody": "We&apos;ve had lots of Big Agnes gear over the years, from tents and chairs to sleeping pads. I&apos;ve never looked at their sleeping systems before though. King Solomon is hands down the best sleeping solution for a couple that likes to cuddle. This is not a sleeping bag that you&apos;d share with your friends as you&apos;d be sleeping pretty close to each other. You can fit is over a single 40in sleeping pad or two 20-25in pads. The best thing is that it can be easily converted to a camp blanket, or even used as a single sleeping bag/quilt. \n\nKing Solomon feels warmer than what it&apos;s rated for because there will be two of you heating the space inside. Have you ever noticed that mittens are warmer than gloves, even if they have the same thickness? Same effect is applied here. \n\nUnlike regular sleeping bags that have down fill all the way around you, King Solomon is more like a quilt with a hood and a sheet that wraps around your sleeping pads. You&apos;d want to invest in a warm sleeping pad. We got Big Agnes Rapide SL Double Wide and it fits perfectly.",

If it had been a few inches longer it probably would have worked out. Enjoy, taller girls!\nI am often between small and medium and sized down — no issues with a 36” bust in the small.",

I bought true to size, XS (5&apos;4&quot;/125 lbs/34A)--if I had a larger chest I would want to size up for comfort. I love how it&apos;s got an easy fit through the body--the soft cotton fabric is soft and it&apos;s lined so this is such an easy, throw-on dress for so many occasions. I plan to pair it with a chunky cardigan or the Zella Mesh Pullover for early spring layering and will definitely have on in rotation for the summer.",

I&apos;m a skinny guy but dang, my entire hand fits between my foot and the strap. Would recommend trying in in person before buying.",

The stitching, seaming and workmanship in general is flawless. Meticulous attention to detail was given to creating this product. The wording on the top strap is embroidered and adds to the overall impression these will make. Very nice look!\r\n\r\nThe arch support on these is amazing. The padding at the heel is about the same height as the padding at the ball of the toes. This makes the sandal cradle your foot and it feels extremely natural. The toe is curled up for a smooth step, allowing the heel to rise naturally. This natural rise will help prevent the sand spray that accompanies a lot of flip-flop brands. I’m excited to see how these break in. I’m assuming they will only get more comfortable.\r\n\r\nAs far as value for the price goes, it’s hard for me to judge at this time. Based on the quality and comfort, I’m assuming I am going to own these and love these for years. I can only state that if these are in your price point, they would be an excellent choice!",

        "reviewBody": "I recently had the opportunity to try out Coleman&apos;s 8-person Skydome tent, and I must say I am quite impressed. As someone who loves camping and spending time outdoors, I am always on the lookout for high-quality camping gear that will make my adventures more enjoyable. The Skydome tent definitely delivers on that front.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed about the tent was how easy it was to set up. The pole system is color-coded, which makes it simple to figure out where each pole goes. The tent also comes with pre-attached poles, which saves time and eliminates the need to thread the poles through the tent sleeves. I was able to set up the tent by myself in under 10 minutes, which is a huge plus in my book.\n\nThe tent is also incredibly spacious, with a center height of 6 feet 5 inches. This made it easy for me and my fellow campers to move around comfortably inside the tent, even with 8 people. The vertical walls of the Skydome tent also provide plenty of headroom, which is a nice feature when you&apos;re trying to change clothes or move around inside the tent.\n\nAnother feature I appreciated about the Skydome tent was the ventilation. The tent has large windows and a mesh ceiling that allow for excellent airflow. This was especially important during the hot summer nights when I used the tent. The ventilation kept the tent cool and prevented condensation from building up inside.\n\nThe tent also comes with a rainfly, which is great for providing extra protection from the elements. The rainfly is easy to attach and does a good job of keeping the tent dry, even in heavy rain. The tent also has taped seams and welded floors, which help to keep water out and provide extra protection.\n\nOne thing I would note is that the tent does not come with a vestibule or awning, which means there is no covered area to store gear or shoes outside the tent. However, this is a minor issue, and there are aftermarket solutions available if you want to add a vestibule or awning to the tent.\n\nOverall, I am very impressed with Coleman&apos;s 8-person Skydome tent. It is easy to set up, spacious, well-ventilated, and provides excellent protection from the elements. Whether you&apos;re camping with a large family or a group of friends, this tent is an excellent choice for your next outdoor adventure.",

I still love my Interceptr, but the Aktivatr is top notch!  The lining at the wear lines makes practical sense and as it turns out, looks good too!  I&apos;ve heard that it looks &quot;futuristic&quot; or &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; from people paying compliments.  I love the thumb catch in the cuff rather than an extra strap!  Great innovation!

These are brand new, and I like that they can be both washed and dried in a washer/dryer; whereas the Interceptr suggests line-dried only.  As they indicated, there is different levels of warmth where it seems like cool air passes more easily through some parts then others.  Not certain how I feel about that, but expect this to be a layer beneath a jacket or coat anyways.\n\nI&apos;m always worried about shrinking, as I&apos;m 5&apos;11 slim with long arms, but after a run through the wash it still fits great and the arm length of a small still reaches perfectly.",

It held up well against her until she discovered the drawstring. Maybe it has more to do with with my knot tying abilities and that I give her treat puzzles but she was able to get into the bag in a few minutes.

The labeling says that it is bear resistant, but that certain critters may create small holes. That would make this less useful if you were traveling in an area where mice were a problem. Like a bear bag or bear canister they do recommend that you deploy it separately away from your camp at night. they also mention other accessories like an aluminum liner to prevent crushing and puncture, as well as an odor barrier bag that they sell. My experience is that this would serve fine as a bear bag, but would not replace a bear canister. In areas where a bear bag is required, it will still be necessary to hang the bag. In an area where a bear canister is required, you might get a ticket if found using this container instead. It does say that it is certified resistant by the interagency grizzly bear committee, but this is likely not accepted by many management agencies like the national forest service or national Park service. while they do not say what the fabric blend is, it feels like it contains Kevlar to me. Closing the bear bag is simple in theory, but may be difficult for people with limited strength in their hands and or arms. I plan to use this as a heavy duty bear hang bag. It is slightly heavier than a typical nylon bag, but it would certainly hold up to abrasion better than a normal bag. ￼ I would not leave it on the ground at night. ￼",

I don&apos;t know what changes you have made to the Ghost 16, but the fit was very different and really tight through the toe box.  The fit was nothing like the Ghost 15 and it&apos;s predecessors.  I am so disappointed.  I can&apos;t imagine why you would change a shoe that has been so successful for so long.",

I’m normally 2EE. Therefore I tried my normal size, 12, too tight width. Therefore back they went and ordered size 13. Thank you with a bit of lace jiggling they fit, a loads of room in front of toes. Hopefully they will be alright. Brooks need to produce various widths in Gortex.",

        "reviewBody": "In typical Endura fashion, I found that these gloves fit and breathe very well. But that&apos;s about where the good things on these gloves end. The fabric of the palm area is much too flexible and stretchy, so it sluices all over the place while you ride making the gloves really annoying, require nearly constant adjustment, in addition to the gel pads moving. In terms of riding comfort, the gel pads leave a huge amount to be desired and offer little to no cushioning and comfort on long rides, so they&apos;re little better than wearing nothing. Would definitely not recommend these in the least.",

The way the suitcase compresses the clothes is unmatched by anything else I’ve seen. We just ordered one for our daughter because there aren’t any other travel bags worth spending on after you’ve had this one. It glides like a dream through the airport, and the easy to reach pocket on top can hold anything from chargers to a thin jacket.",

I knew boots can be tricky to size sometimes so I ordered 44.5 and 45. The 45 was too loose to when i had it cinched down, my foot was sliding around enough to make me concerned for blisters on a long outing. The 44.5’s were too narrow in the toe box, pinching off circulation too much for me. Outside of fit, these boots seemed like a great price point for a hybrid backpacking/summer mountaineering boot. They definitely felt secure and stiff underfoot. I just wish they fit me better.",

The boots have enough flex that there is no issues using them on decently long approaches, but are still stiff enough to perform on steep snow and short scrambles.  They kept my feet toasty on chilly days but my toes began to get pretty cold when the temp dropped to around 10F one evening hiking into camp at about 12,500 ft.\n\nAll in all, great boot if you are looking for an affordable option to try the sport out or if you plan on sticking to well established routes in the lower 48 during early spring/late fall.  If you plan to cross a glacier, you may want to look for a sturdier boot.",

Tried L and XL trying to get it to fit slimmer, but needed the XL for my arms (36&quot; sleeve - 6&apos;4&quot;).

The large fits my 6&apos; slender frame just right and the sleve length is perfect for me. The shirt is stretchy and does dry quickly. I wore this shirt on a half marathon last week and it performed well in 65 degree weather. It didn&apos;t pill from my hydration pack. I really do like this shirt! However, there&apos;s one big negative: it does hold stink in. I have quite a few other long sleeve shirts (wool and/or polyester) that do not smell after I wear them. However, this OR ActiveIce sun shirt does sadly hold in stink. This means I&apos;ll wear it for day hikes or runs, but I won&apos;t use it for multi-day hikes.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As an avid hiker and outdoor enthusiast, I recently purchased the ActiveIce Spectrum Sun LS in Titanium, and I must say, it&apos;s been a game-changer. The color was exactly as depicted in the photos, and the material looks just as impressive in person. I put it to the test during hikes and outdoor work under the scorching sun, and it did not disappoint. The breathability and durability of this shirt are outstanding. I accidentally snagged it on a pallet, but thanks to its stretchiness, it survived without a tear-a real lifesaver. What iDelmpressed me the most is how it doesn&apos;t cling to my skin, providing much-needed freedom of movement during those hot and sweaty days. Being someone with a darker complexion, sun protection is paramount for me. The ActiveIce Spectrum Sun LS excels in this department, effectively blocking the sun&apos;s rays and keeping me comfortable during extended outdoor activities. If I had to mention one minor quibble, it would be the fit. As a 5&apos;11&quot; individual weighing 154 lbs, I found it to be a bit too relaxed. I wish it were more fitted to complement my physique better. Overall, I can confidently say that this purchase was solid. The ActiveIce Spectrum Sun LS has become my go-to outdoor companion, and I&apos;m already considering getting more. Whether it&apos;s hiking or working in the sun, this shirt has proven itself to be a reliable and comfortable asset to have.",

Weathered extreme winds (the highest I have ever camped in), driving rain, sleet, and snow (7-8”). It was a rock. The only reason that this is not a 5 star review is that you need 4 to 6 additional guy lines &amp; pegs to make this thing bulletproof but they do not come with the tent when you purchase it. My recommendation to anybody who is buying these Access tents is to buy the additional guy lines and pegs… once you add them this thing is unstoppable. \nI did read comments about condensation issues but I did not experience any more or less condensation using this tent.

I really want to love this tent but every review forum I can find there are a slew of owners who have noted the plastic pole inserts breaking or the pole ends splitting from modest use. No doubt the Syclone material is great stuff in terms of the mid section of the poles but if the plastic inserts are breaking and/or the Syclone material is prone to delaminating at the pole ends where the inserts reside then something simply has to be done I&apos;d think?? Any changes in the works to address this??",

It works alright in a windy fall alpine environment, but when there is little wind or the temperature is much below zero degrees C there are many condensation issues. This tent provides an excellent lesson in the water cycle to any mountaineers who care to use it in winter conditions. Also had the poles break on my second trip out with this due to poor construction and weak pole material. Though I got replacement parts, I would be very hesitant to take this tent on any serious expedition. There are more robust lightweight options out there. \n\nThis tent could be greatly improved by providing poles that can stand up to winter conditions and providing roof and fly venting to better manage condensation. I have two TNF winter tents that manage condensation exceedingly well with their vents.",

However when I took it into colder temperatures one of the plastic pole tips broke, with little stress put on it. Makes you wonder why they put plastic pole tips on a 4-season tent. After sending my poles in and waiting for a couple months they were sent back and they were said to be fixed but nothing was changed and the tip was still broken. I wanted to love this tent, it is beautiful and well made but the poles and Cascade Designs (parent company) service is terrible. Especially for this tent costing what it does.",

Condensation has never been an issue for me with this tent. Pay attention to the relative humidity, what you&apos;re pitching on, vent high and low - adjust your fly tension and just make sure air is getting in and venting out. Spend enough time in the outdoors with your tent and you&apos;ll figure it out. This is a great tent that bridges the gap between backpacking and mountaineering tents.",

        "reviewBody": "As a full-time mountain guide for Colorado Mountain School I have spent years guiding and camping in many different environments and feel pretty savvy with pitching a tent. When I read the description of the MSR Access 2 tent stating that it is easy to set up I figured the best test was to have someone who has never camped before attempt the process of pitching the tent. My client from Italy had not only ever camped but had never even seen a tent before our camping 101 class. I gave him the tent without any instructions how to proceed, but he managed to put the tent up without any difficulties and kept saying &quot;&quot;this is easy&quot;&quot;. It helps that the stuff sack has very clear pictures depicting the process. Mission accomplished! For my client&apos;s first night sleeping in a tent I let him explore the luxury of sleeping solo in there. He was so very pleased with how lightweight and packable the tent was and the comfort and roomie feeling inside that he is looking to get one for himself even if it is considered a two-person tent. It was fairly warm during our camping experience and in the desert heat it did ventilate sufficiently but not great. The mesh vents are pretty small but camping without the fly would be the preferred option when in warmer temperatures. The next testing environment was at 11,000 feet in the Gore Range in Colorado, where I was teaching a beginning mountaineering course. The inside of the tent is very comfortable for two but there is not much extra room inside for gear storage. This is not of great concern as there are two vestibules that are large enough for backpack storage and for cooking.There are two mesh pockets inside the tent big enough for storing small items (phone, headlamp, lip balm etc.) but they are not quite big enough for larger items such as socks and gloves. The tent is fine for two people sleeping head to foot but the sidewalls are not that steep so the tent body tends to hit the sleeping bags.",

The water bottle pockets are so tight and small on this bag, that it is darn near impossible to keep a Nalgene bottle in there without it popping out…and that’s if I can even get the bottle in the pocket when the bag has a few items in it.\n\nI’ve made the same comment about the Nano 20.\n\nWhen did the regular Nalgene 1L bottle fall out of favor as the industry standard?\n\nIs the idea to cater to the crowd that seems to favor dainty half liter bottles?\n\nOne of the water bottle pockets is already starting to rip because it takes so much effort to try to get the Nalgene in there.\n\nYes, I absolutely have to carabiner the bottles to the bag, and it’s not uncommon for those bottles to pop out and sway back and forth as I’m walking…and that’s just going from the parking lot into work.\n\nReally Gregory, if you’d just run this by me before making a whole product line with these inadequate, just for show water bottle pockets, I would have demonstrated how epically the fail every single day and suggest strongly that you tweak the design before shipping these out.\n\nI’m happy to field test things like this so you don’t end up spending so much time on repairs when these fail…and they will fail quickly.\n\nLet me know. I’m here to help!",

Water for me and the pup, rain gear, an extra layer and hat, emergency bivy/shelter, first aid kit, snacks and plenty of room to spare. The east access is great for your keys, snacks, lip balm etc. I love the clips on the front to hang my flashlight, clip a hat, or even hold my long leash. The fit is extremely comfortable and the chest strap is adjustable to height as well as width for a very custom fit. Took a risk ordering this online without trying it on but I’m so glad I did.",

        "reviewBody": "When Gregory announced their plus-sized line, I was cautiously optimistic. So many companies advertise plus-sized outdoor gear/clothing but don&apos;t actually resize the items. Instead they add some extra inches of webbing or extensions you can purchase separately. Gregory completely revamped their packs and made every part of them plus-sized, not just the straps. I finally have a pack that fits my body, and doesn&apos;t leave sore spots and rubbed raw skin after a hard day of hiking. I&apos;ve carried this pack on trails and through towns/cities for a year and it hasn&apos;t failed to meet and exceed every expectation/test I put it to. Their iconic durability and usability now in a pack made specifically for plus-sized bodies. Thank you Gregory for helping bring inclusivity to the outdoors!",
