I ordered these shoes from a retailer in a size EU 40 which ended up being an okay size but could’ve gone with 1/2 a size up. While I loved the teddy look of these, I ended up returning them. I just didn’t love them overall. I felt like they didn’t go well with my style. Also they could’ve been a bit more comfy.",

I wonder if it’s more of an uphill boot and not ideal for northeast US hiking, rocky, roots, and sometimes wet. My wife has slipped several times on wet rocks while wearing these. Her latest fall resulted in a sprained ankle. At first, I thought she wasn’t being careful, but I was surprised when I compared her traction with mine on a wet rock. My shoes gripped much better on the wet surface than hers. Sorry for the long review, simply stated, these aren’t the boots for you if you intend to hike wet, rocky terrain. The boots are well made (except the sole) and nice to look at.",

        "reviewBody": "Was so unsure about these boots and the size that I even spoke to Danner twice. Set up to return them, but right before my hiking trip my old boots died. Brought these to hike allll around CO/pikes peak without breaking them in first. They were my ONLY shoes for the trip. Armed myself with blister bandaids, but they broke in so easily. So comfortable, great quality. **They fit my orthotics. The inner liner comes out and your orthotics will fit without issue. For those with tricky feet-look no further!** \nI decided on a 7.5, which is my normal size. I did not feel they would stretch enough with the 7s, and I was right. They rubbed a little at the Achilles and outer ankle when breaking in but are perfect after one long hike.  \nLoooove them, buying a second pair in brown?because If you have hard to fit feet, ya buy as many pairs of the same comfortable, well fitting boot you can.\nPerfect cute functional boot from trail to town. Waterproof. Quality. Perfection.\n*note: they do look better worn in. Less police shiny shoe vibes.",

        "reviewBody": "It has a very streamlined shape where it tapers to become very narrow at the portion nearest the seat post. This makes it look cool, but not very conducive to storage. I had a hard time fitting a road tube+2 levers+ 1 can co2 and adapter + 1 SMALL multi tool. There was still volume left but it was difficult to close. I&apos;d rather not have to play Tetris on the roadside, so I opted for the blackburn grid. To me the grid looks similar in size but it&apos;s rectangular, so I can actually fit a MTB tube + all that other stuff (and more). \n\nThe Lizard skin would probably last longer than the one I went with. This thing seems to be expertly crafted. It is beautiful and made from a really nice, obviously water resistant material (almost like it&apos;s coated in wax). The zippers are covered with some other material that is water resistant as well.  My one other complaint is how it fastens. It has the traditional two straps for the seat bars and one strap for the seat post. If you want to keep it tight up under the seat, it may be difficult to open because of the zipper placement. You basically have to stick your fingers between the bag and seat, and I found that I needed to let it hang down slightly to make it a little more accessible. \n\nTLDR: Beautiful bag, so-so design. I would say if you don&apos;t carry an extra tube this thing will be a very decent choice, especially if you value appearance. If you do carry a road tube, you might consider going up to the next size, or looking elsewhere. It probably goes without saying, but if you need to carry a mtb tube, absolutely look into something bigger.",

Only complaint is that the outer fabric is structured with a weave and texture that tends to kinda make dirt stick to it, so it seems to pick up the filth a little quicker than some other jackets I&apos;ve had, but this is a trivial thing.  I love the fit, form and function.  Super warm, good sized hood, nice wrist cuffs.  Pockets are good.  Overall, super impressed.",

I like the balance between stiffness/stability and weight.  In CO we also often have powder days through May and I find that it’s shape adapts well to all conditions corn —&gt; powder. I’m fortunate to be able to ski all of the different models of Weston skis, and this one is becoming my favorite in the lineup due to its versatility and its ability to perform in a variety of snow conditions. I have skied some fairly big lines on this ski in variable conditions and would do it again.",

Whether you&apos;re in the deep or skiing spring corn, this ski tackles it all with ease. They&apos;re light enough to tuck way back into the woods on a long approach and strong enough to rip on steep, technical terrain. Snappy enough to make quick and efficient hop turns, and stable enough to straightline steeps. Truly a do it all ski, I can&apos;t speak highly enough of the construction.",

        "reviewBody": "So I filled the bladder, popped in my Blackburn multi tool, co2 inflator, and two gu packets. The waist belt is so stretchy it will not hold it up on your hip. What initially feels comfortable, changes as soon as you start walking. The weight in the pack lets it flop around more than I&apos;m comfortable with and I have had to pull it back up. I&apos;m a bit chonky so it shouldn&apos;t just fall down over my butt. The bite valve is another area I&apos;m not happy with. Initially I struggled to get more than mere drops of water. If you bite it right at the tip you can get a flow of water, but nothing to write home about. It&apos;s just restrictive and needs to be swapped out to a different style. Funny, as mine says to twist to unlock, but it just pulls and pushes straight in and out. There is no lock, per se. \n\nStorage is nice and convenient. The magnet on the hose works very well, however if the hose won&apos;t reach to one of the sewn loops, don&apos;t expect that plastic clip for the magnet to stay on the stretchy belt. \n\nI wouldn&apos;t buy this again. I wouldn&apos;t recommend it to anybody either because of the faults I outlined. There are other packs that don&apos;t have these issues. I will probably be buying some webbing and having that sewn in place of the stretchy belt instead",

        "reviewBody": "In 1990 I bought a Dana Design Terraplane and Feathered Friends sleeping bag for a winter mountaineering trip in the Colorado Rockies.  Until 2022, I had both, but I gave the Terraplane away when I moved internationally.  After 30 years, it still had a lot of life in it!  I used that backpack for multiple backcountry ski mountaineering trips in the Rockies as well as travel in the Canadian wilderness, Africa, Nepal and 2 years backpacking in Southeast Asia.  I had a compatible Dana Design duffle that worked really well to cover the pack for international flights, and it also took the grease stains from rickety old boats and busses in SE Asia, keeping the backpack in good condition.  Over those 30 years, the only thing that needed replacing was the foam pad which broke down to years of exposure to sweat and the elements.  The pack comfortably carried everything I needed for winter trips. \r\n\r\nOver the decades, I wondered if a more modern, lighter backpack would be better, as the Terraplane always felt a bit heavy / burly--but that&apos;s probably why it lasted decades.  The other issue I didn&apos;t like was that the lid compartment was large and would flop around unless totally filled.  A minor issue was that the OG version didn&apos;t have a quick access to the length of the main compartment.  Bear in mind, these comments are not for this updated version.\r\n\r\nNow I&apos;m back in the market to replace it, and I see that the bag is back in production.  Surprisingly, the weight difference between it and some other options isn&apos;t that much.  I&apos;m inclined to get the new Terraplane because it&apos;s such a good bag, though now that I&apos;m older, it&apos;s probably overkill for me.  Adjusted for inflation, it&apos;s cheaper now than back in 1990, and if the new version is as good as the older one, it will no doubt last me the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nI&apos;ve attached photos of my original Terraplane as a testament to how well it held up.  Sorry if this review isn&apos;t entirely relevant, but I saw a few other OG Terraplane reviews, so I thought I&apos;d add my own.",

Use of the main pack shoulder straps are overkill when used with small and non-ergonomic to the back hood for day hikes from base camp.  Seems the older waist pack version is a more practical, durable and capable design.  Thinking of sewing on waist straps for waist pack/fanny pack use.  Is this something Mystery Ranch can do?",

I never know where I put anything up there in the 2 small pockets and it won&apos;t take a map unless it&apos;s folded up small. The one pocket top pocket as on the original is more functional. \r\n The sleeping bag compartment seems much smaller than the original Terraplane.  The buckle system on the sleeping bag compartment is just more weight and will wear more rapidly. \r\n Seems good for carrying weight but the 2 mentioned downfalls are a definite minus.",

It took a little bit to fit the pack to me but once I got it adjusted it fits like a glove.  I&apos;m looking forward to another 30 years out of this pack.

I wear these for everyday shoes, they provide good traction, reasonable padding, great lacing system. Dressy enough for my lifestyle. This pair is probably my tenth or twelfth pair.

I guess a very poor glue job, poor construction. I wish they were sewn. I agree with the other reviewer who dislikes the indented lines on the insole, which collect sweat and dirt. I&apos;ve had to clean out the indented lines after each of my (three) wears, with a metal tool, then I clean the insoles with alcohol pads. It&apos;s too bad these sandals are poorly made, because they&apos;re cute and comfortable. This was my first Teva purchase and now I can&apos;t trust the brand. In terms of sizing, they&apos;re sized small. I ordered a 6.5, my normal sandal size, and had to return them for a 7.",

The awesome yoga pant inspired waist was so soft and comfortable... but the legs were way too baggy. If I could combine the waist from these shorts with the legs from the Troy Lee Lilium shorts they would be perfect!!",

The material is really nice. Excellent for outfit layering. \nTwo slightly annoying things with the built-in bra -- the two cup pieces tend to slide around, and I&apos;m not sure if they&apos;re removable. It&apos;s kind of awkward to position them correctly. Also the bra band on the inside can fit a bit tight. By the end of the day I had a red mark around my ribs from it. \nOverall though, I like these tops and they&apos;re very flattering.",

To be fair, I can&apos;t seem to find a decent pair of gloves in the past few years, so my search continues. Just used them to take the dog for a walk here in Portland-- misty and 40 degrees. I don&apos;t get cold easily, and I agree with some other reviewers that they just don&apos;t keep your fingers warm. This could be because the fit is wrong. As some others have mentioned, the width is correct, but the fingers are too long and I ordered a size small. My hands were freezing after a short 15-minute walk. Sadly, I think I might be returning these!",

My hands were freezing cold and getting numb as I can’t go back home to wear it again. it doesn’t serve what they promised for. \nPlus the touchscreen on index finger is bulky and not stitched right according to women finger. It should be small pointy delicate. Not thick bulky like a man’s finger. It’s really difficult to even unlock my phone. If I have to text someone this is a worst glove to wear.

I interpreted &apos;adjustable waist&apos; as stretchy waist like most toddler pants. But the waist is all canvas, with a stretchy internal &apos;belt&apos; so you can make it fit tighter. But at its loosest, it was still too tight for him. It would be nice if there were more pictures showing the waistline, because I wouldn&apos;t have ordered them if I&apos;d seen how it&apos;s actually designed. Otherwise, it&apos;s your standard sturdy carhartt pant.",

We truly appreciate you bringing the matter to our attention.\n\nWe are very sorry to hear that the jacket is pilling after first wash.\n\nIf washed according to the laundering instructions from our website and the laundry tag, the item should not have this issue. To get red of the pilling, we might recommend using a razor or fabric shaver.\n\nIf the issue will still occur, please submit a warranty claim on our website and we will take a closer look.\n\nWe will make sure to forward your feedback to an appropriate department, so that we may investigate the issue.

Some of the highlights are the well designed thumbholes, there are actual zipper pulls instead of just the cheap little knots, makes it easier to pull zippers with gloves. The sleeves are also long for a large and that combined with the smooth exterior fabric make is easy to layer. Quality is spot on. I got the yellow gold and it is much darker in person.

However once they get wet- no matter how much you rinse, wash, treat, dry- they smell like a cat box... not sure why Teva can&apos;t manage to get a true anti-bacterial material to construct the foam footbed from to prevent this.

        "reviewBody": "Bought these boots originally about a month ago. I have a pair of boots from a PNW boot maker that I love, but needed a Chelsea style boot for a work situation where I would need to take my shoes off and put them back on multiple times per day. That boot maker doesn&apos;t make a Chelsea, so I went looking elsewhere. I hadn&apos;t tried any Red Wing heritage products before, but had heard that people love the Iron Rangers and Moc Toe boots so I decided to give these a try since they seemed close to the type of boots I had come to like. Boy, was I wrong.\r\n\r\nI was confused when I first put the boots on. The foam insoles were topped with leather which was... odd for a heritage boot. I figured it was maybe to make the boots more approachable by adding some under-foot comfort and who doesn&apos;t like that? \r\n\r\nOnce I got the boots home, I realized that the pair I was sold was actually two different sizes in the same box. The store claimed they were like that from the factory and seemed to struggle to figure out what to do about this. No big deal - they figured out they&apos;d order me a new pair. That&apos;s fine. Except that it wasn&apos;t. \r\n\r\nThe new pair I had received (and already paid for) had some obviously wacky stitching in the welt around the big toe on the right boot. Just cosmetic, I figured. But a defect nonetheless. \r\n\r\nSo I wore them for a couple days until the boots tried to eat a hole through the back of my heel. I reached a hand in  to make sure there was no debris or anything that would be making this happen only to find the debris was actually a piece of the boot. There&apos;s a sharp piece of plastic Red Wing is trying to pass off as a heel counter covered by the world&apos;s thinnest leather liner. That vicious heel counter feels like it&apos;s covered with a paper thin layer of leather. \r\n\r\nAs I explored the boot, I realized the leather liner stops and becomes... synthetic something? I don&apos;t know what the toe liner material is. \r\n\r\nIt would be possible to let any of these individual transgressions against the boot gods slide, but once those plastic heel counters announced themselves too loudly to ignore, it brings all the elements into focus in a way that makes me regret I bought these.\r\n\r\nFor the price, I&apos;d expect a heritage boot. Is Red Wing&apos;s heritage building boots with plastic parts? The thinnest possible linings? Switching to synthetic materials in places they don&apos;t expect people to look? Misplacing stitches with no apparent quality control? If so, Red Wing&apos;s heritage doesn&apos;t deserve to be carried on any further and definitely doesn&apos;t deserve another dollar of mine or yours.\r\n\r\nI added a star because the boots almost look nice (except for the wonky stitching) and the upper leather appears to be of decent quality.",

For reference, I wear them about 6 months out of the year and a couple times throughout the summer time. \r\n\r\nLet me start by saying there really isn’t a “break in” period with these. Right out of the box, they are very comfortable. As you wear them, they obviously will mold to your foot bed. \r\n\r\nThe quality is 8.7 out of 10. The elastic is starting to get pretty stretched out. The leather itself is awesome if you take care of it. \r\n\r\nOverall, I highly suggest buying this boot! Whether it’s dress up or just going to the store, these are perfect to slip on and go.",

The break in period was really short for a traditional Goodyear Welted boot. Leather is top notch and has aged very well in the last 6 months with a nice patina from two or three conditionings with Red Wing leather cream. The one issue I have is the poor QC on multiple pairs - first pair I had were warrantied with a seam falling apart at the vamp after two weeks of wear, now this pair the elastic on is coming apart, both boots have this issue. Would still recommend these boots! Solid 4.5 and I love em, just wish the QC would get stepped up.",

But GripIt has cracked the code on a glove that&apos;s truly fit for all sorts of riding. These are some of the best fitting gloves I&apos;ve ever worn. No bunching at the palms, no pinching at the bottom of my fingers, plus they&apos;re surprisingly breathable too for how durable the palm is. Just make sure you follow the sizing chart because GripIt&apos;s size range encompasses everything from little kids up through NBA player sized hands.",

I work in an office and wore these on a day after a hard rain. Well I stepped in one puddle ( not deep and did not splash inside the boot) and the inside of my boots were wet. Maybe these would be good for hiking in Arizona, but nowhere that is a bit wet. At least they look cool.",

These are all qualities I find very desirable for the type of walking I do.  I am not an avid trail hiker and do most of my walking in my residential neighborhood in Portland, Oregon.  My walks are frequent, usually 2 miles, covering varied terrain (sidewalks, park fields, and city pathways) and routes.  I am more the flaneur than the inveterate hiker.  My Merrill’s are very supportive and comfortable, and their being waterproof is a particularly appreciated quality for Portland’s rainy late falls and winters.  Wet grass…no problem!  To boot (no pun intended here) they are also attractively designed.",

Whether you are curled up on the couch with you special someone or on the third and most grueling pitch of ice this shirt is great.  Soft wool that doesn&apos;t itch and is super durable.  I&apos;ve been wearing them for years now and washing them and they have yet to spring a hole it run in them.  The &quot;hand panties&quot; option on the cuff is a nice feature for the walks in the park when it is brisk or to cover your hands on a cool day that is sunny while rowing a raft.",

The sweet spot is Mens 36&quot;\nI am a Carpenter and have 3 pair I have rotated for work over the past 5-6 years, wearing them 75% of the work days. These are virtually indestructible! Only one pair has retained a dime sized stain, none have fabric runs, and all the zippers work!  They are lightweight and durable and perfect for residential light construction. They might be good for mountain biking too.\nAlso, an iphone 13 with an otterbox fits nicely in the leg pocket of this Ether model, with easy access if you don&apos;t have thick gloves on.  I am unsure if the other Ether styles have smaller leg pocket openings depending on the inseam length.",

        "reviewBody": "I was looking for a warm (1st priority), waterproof boot that I could wear to go on snowy walks and shovel the drive, but also something somewhat stylish that I could wear out in town (not pack boots). These boots fit the bill perfectly. Exceptionally warm and waterproof. Met the test of slushy snowy walks and driveway shoveling. Unfortunately, HH did not think to add loop/tab on the back to help with pulling the boot on, which would be helpful, and thus the only reason I didn&apos;t give 5 stars. Other than that, very happy with the purchase. Boots fit true to size, and pack out slightly so no need to size up.",

        "reviewBody": "This knee pad fits a bit snug based on the sizing, but not so restrictive that it&apos;s noticable. I will say the fit is amazing...when it stays in place.  It does slide down over time, possibly due to the shape of my thigh, which will cause the backside material to fold or bunch up.  This bunching uncomfortably cuts into the back of my knee.  Mind you, this is an improvement over the hefty, hot, and shifty VPD 2.0. Also, not sure it&apos;s worth the cost compared to other slip-on pads (no straps to tension).",

        "reviewBody": "These are fantastic knee pads.  I&apos;m 6&apos;2&quot;, 175 lbs and ordered a large per the size chart on POC&apos;s official website.  They have nice solid padding that is ventilated and cups the knee well, and the side protection is a nice touch.  Very breathable for this level of protection, great fabric, grippy silicone that keeps them in place and they didn&apos;t rub me a bit.  Would recommend for aggressive XC, trail and enduro.  They felt great right out of the box, so I went big and did 18.5 miles yesterday for my first ride in these pads, including 2,750 ft of climbing... it was about 90 degrees and high humidity (typical Knoxville summer weather).  Stayed put the whole dang time and didn&apos;t make me feel like I was riding in knee warmers.  I&apos;ve tried nearly every knee pad out there, and I&apos;m very picky.  10/10 would recommend these.  My other favorites are the Leatt Airflex Pro (cooler but not as much protection) and the 7iDP Sam Hill pads (very similar level of protection and breathability to these POCs).",

          "Great review. Coming from the 7idp Sam Hills, I?m torn between getting those again or trying these. Can you give a more detailed comparison between the two? Especially regarding breathability and pedal friendliness. Im also worried about them getting gross since u can?t remove the pads to wash"

They are the perfect balance between lightweight and protective,  they have POC&apos;s VPD padding instead of a hard plastic shell over the knee, which allows them to be lightweight and flexible without sacrificing protection.  I have been on numerous rides with them, have fallen and no issues with them sliding around and definitely do their job protecting my knees from cuts, scrapes, and everything else.  The sleeve material is so comfortable that you barely notice that you are wearing them!",

I enjoy hiking and mostly biking on plentiful overland routes. The 1.5L size bag has worked well for my biking toolkits where each color is used for the different kits that I ride with in the rear of my Gore-Tex jerseys. One kit includes 2x tubes (MTB or Gravel or Road) and CO2 carts and tire patches and levers, and others include appropriate tools. Very convenient to simply slip 2x kits needed for whichever bike into the back jersey pockets. Color coded and water resistant. I like the thickness and inside coating.

So nice not having to tap, tap, tap your way to different functions. \n\nThe only thing I would love to see is a slight extension of the part of the lamp that sits on your forehead, something for you to just rest a fingertip on so that tilting the lamp is easier. As it is now, it&apos;s a little bit clumsy trying to change the angle of the lamp. \n\nGreat product. I&apos;ll probably be buying a few more just to have.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought a pair of the mens low top version. Unfortunately they just didn’t hold up for daily use. After a year the outsole started to separate and the area around the flex rubber started to separate. This made the waterproofing pointless. I usually buy hiking shoes for daily use because they hold up longer and are more comfortable but that was not the case with theses. I would recommend staying away from the flex style boot.",

Glad I had a band-aide for the 4 miles back. I will tie them tighter and wear thicker socks. I like the flex feature across the top of the foot and that there are truly waterproof. Hiking the Annapurna Circuit this fall and think these will be perfect.\nI bought the Terradora Flex also, while these are specifically designed for women, they were not as comfortable as the Timberwolf Flex.

I&apos;ve destroyed countless pairs of boots in a matter of a few months- before i got a pair of keens. They are the only pair of boots that can withstand the outdoors. I recommend keens to all of my biologist friends. perfectly waterproof, the flex seems to be a key factor in how these boots survive constant bending. and, they are PFAS free! \nI have a pair of keen sandals and boots in 8 &amp; 1/2 (US) and i ordered the same size in these and they ran pretty large. had to send them back for an 8 and possibly could have gone with a 7 &amp; 1/2 even. these run large for some reason.",

After walking around in them for just 5 minutes, the supports in the outer ankle area were hitting my ankle bone so much that they hurt. They fit just fine, true to size. Maybe my height (5&apos;4&quot;), weight (130 lbs), and ankle shape just didn&apos;t work well with this design. But I was very disappointed, knowing there was no way I could hike in these.

I got some Castelli bib shorts as well and needed to exchange for 3XL as well.  This was my first Castelli purchase and I&apos;m discovering that just about everything they sell runs small - even gloves and socks which I ordered as well.

I bought chartreuse thinking it would be a very bright yellow as it looks online but it is more of an olive color and not as high vis as I wanted. I am more of a chubby female rider. Last year I bought a Castelli jersey 3XL (pass or fluoso I think) and it fit perfectly (snug) but this jersey has a lot more room. Still a good jersey.",

The shirts are made of soft ,freely mobile , breathable material that is UPF rated for sun blockade. Machine Washable material Sizing is true to measurements.\r\n My favorite colors are green and beiges. They run true to size, with a flexible pane in the back for added range of motion of the upper extremity when hunting or clay target sports. I particularly enjoy the butt plate pad on the right shoulder. It works well as a non slip surface with minimal increase in the length of pull (does not add length to the gun). \r\nOne of the neatest aspects of the shirt are the loops that can connect to just above the elbows and allow one to roll up the sleeves and hold them in an elevated position. The buttons are very durable and distinctive.",

The suspenders stay up and supportive. The cuffs stand up to sharp edges and running boards of snowmobiles. Has great pockets with pockets within for phone storage. I really like that the trim inside the pockets is orange so you can see that they are open and don&apos;t fill them with snow. Glad to see a product still being made with Pro so I can last longer than a single season.",

The pants offer excellent water/snow protection and has great ventilation on both sides.

Colombia Silver Ridge Cargos (100% nylon ripstop material) feel, at worst, like fine Thai silk, and at best, like a cool breeze shimmering around your nether regions. Whether you&apos;re hiking, traveling, shopping, on dates, lounging at the beach, or just taking an afternoon nap, these are the best pants I&apos;ve ever stepped into. If Colombia had provided the cast of Star Trek (TNG) with outfits made of this magical stuff, we&apos;d never have heard of the &apos;Picard Maneuver.&apos;\n\nTwo deep cargo pockets on each side lay flat, so you don&apos;t need to google &apos;are cargos considered dad pants,&apos; but expand when needed for camera lenses, gadgets, or small tools, along with regular side pockets that your keys won&apos;t chew up. Everything is kept in place with an amazing belt quick-lock system that actually keeps your pants up while letting you slip through airport security with ease. If it&apos;s true that love is the reason we&apos;re here, and we should shun material things, I&apos;ve got to admit I fail—because I love these shorts. They never feel tight and are very forgiving if you happen to be a little rotund.\n\nMy very smart-looking and functional anti-cargo-cargos. Get them!",

I run this set up on both my &quot;A&quot; (summer) bike and my Winter bike. I watch other riders change flats ( running on &quot;cheap&quot; tires) all year long. \nSome people say these tires a too hard to mount onto their rims. The tires are a bit tuff to get on the 1st time, I have Enve SES 4.5 and Campy Alloy wheels, but I can do it without tire levers (although my thumbs are a bit sore afterwards) if necessary. \nI no long race, I do however ride about 9,000 to 10,000 miles a year.

After coming home from rides with another cut or two every time out from the ice melt material on Pennsylvania roads. I was surprised to find that the performance drop off was not noticeable . They feel great and are STRONG.  The shoulders of roads where most of the ice melt debris winds up had no effect on the Gatorskins. After about a thousand miles, one small cut, no flats !  The cut could have been from glass which is an increasing problem as the the pickup truck driving set seems to be having trouble reaching the weeds when throwing there empty cheap vodka bottles out the window and breaking them on the shoulder . GREAT TIRES !",

Another bonus, I am able to get away with wearing this shirt and carhartt vest on a cold day, versus having to wear a bulky jacket, which restricts mobility ... good quality shirt and am sure I will have for the years to come",

The length was good - I&apos;m 5&apos;10 with a 36&quot; inseam.  These stopped at the top of my boots but my socks and gaiters kept my ankles warm. These were excellent at blocking the wind.  I was able to wear these over a base layer and insulated leggings layer.  The only unfortunate part was that the waist was a bit big and poofy.  I didn&apos;t exchange for a lower size in case they would be too short or too tight in the leg and I didn&apos;t want to lose that comfort.  But I might have them taken in a bit.  I still highly recommend.",

I tried to find  way to tighten them but there are no buttons, velcro, or belt loops to be able to cinch the waist.\n\nI wore them out on a multi-day hike and the very thin material ripped in two spots on different occasions.",

My old ones are over 10 years old and the Velcro straps are stretched out and have lost their griping / sticking power. But still stayed up pretty darn well . I still use them in my snowboard kit  . \nThis new pair feel a bit tighter and the top strap is thicker and stronger .  Many people have commented that they run small. I would say that they start out a bit tight but because the material forms to your body slowly I have no problem wearing these for my 2-3 hour  local rides . I do sometimes push them down while climbing or leave them in my pack till I get to the top or the sketchy downhills. \nAs far as crash protection , these are the absolute best. !  I crashed my knee on a railroad tie recently and these pads saved me.\nAlso the outer material is somehow rip proof .\nMy old pair has been crashed on so many times and still has no rips . \nAnother thing is how nice these are to kneel down on while doing any trail side maintenance ! Yeah, they are expensive but your knees are worth it !",

They are not.  The Nocs website describes them as water resistant and fog proof.  If you were to drop one into a river even for a moment it would be ruined.  I would love it if Backcountry would change the wording in their listing and send a new monocular for my wonderful girlfriend.   We promise to be more careful with them in the future.",

They performed roughly close to XT but not as good as XTR. I had noticeable brake fade and they were very sensitive to any sort of contamination. Found myself having to clean them and check my pads often. Upgrading pads and calipers helped some.",

Since the other item in my order arrived damaged and I have already returned it (and had to pay to return it!) I am electing to keep this bag and will just replace the strap with something else. (if returns were free, it definitely would be going back for replacement). Had good results with my previous Roswheel bag so, hopefully this is an isolated issue.",

        "reviewBody": "The materials this was made out of seemed pretty decent quality. It has a YKK Vislon zipper, the ripstop material seems very sturdy and thick.\n\nHowever, this brand has the strangest fit. I am in between a Medium and Large for pretty much every brand. I ordered a Medium on this because you want a windbreaker to be more snug. However, this thing fit like I was wearing a 45-gallon trash bag. It was super baggy and strange looking.\n\nI bought another item from this brand that also fits strange, but was much cheaper and I like a bit better so am keeping it. However, this windbreaker is going back. I got it on sale for $38 and don&apos;t even think it is worth that. I just don&apos;t think I could bare to be seen in public wearing this.\n\nIt definitely does not fit like a windbreaker for active activities. It is more of a city-design, however it is just like a strange thin parka. Skip this.\n\nPS: You can&apos;t even find any info on this brand. Why don&apos;t they have a simple website? Even mom&amp;pop stores have websites.",

They are narrow too, which is amazing for me because I have narrow feet, but for normal feet these are going to be too small in every dimension, definitely order a full size larger than normal.\r\n\r\nOther than that, the sole is fantastic for flat pedals, it&apos;s great for walking around town, and the show is nice and comfortable for everyday use. It&apos;s a little on the warmer side, but it breathes well (the shoe has some nice padding). The white gets dirty immediately, but it looks good dirty (maybe it&apos;s just me but I like a dirty white canvas sneaker).",

They stick, have plenty of feeling for those dime edges, and you can wear them for a full session without removal. My only regret is that I didn&apos;t buy every pair available in my size.

Like most things Campy this will not appeal to everyone, but it is just so much cleaner and lighter than the other options.  I have ridden the group now for about 200mi total including the Belgian Waffle Ride in Cedar City.  The groupset performed flawless without issue even in the deep sand and moon dust conditions of BWR.",

        "reviewBody": "Will they do it again?   The roof rack was very difficult to attach to my Prius v.  Thule makes it difficult by creating instructions that are too general and not specific to the kit given.   Thus, unless you have done it before, it will take lots of time to figure out very simple stuff.   So, my advice--lay out everything and make certain it&apos;s in the right order.   I took apart my racks three times before all the pieces were correctly placed.   Also, make certain the decorative caps are snapped in as two of mine blew off and now the rack looks even more poorly designed.",

          "Thank you for sharing your feedback on the Thule FitKit 145129.\nAccording to our moderation records, your prior review was removed for violating community standards for generally inappropriate langauge.\nThule roof rack systems include vehicle-specific mounting instructions to ensure the specially-designed FitKit attaches to the correct and most supportive area of the vehicle. This process may be more involved than more general roof rack fits to ensure a strong hold. A second person makes this process much easier as they can help position the crossbars and ensure they do not move while tightening in place. \nIf installation assistance is needed, Thule Customer Support is available Monday-Friday, 8:30 am - 5:30 pm EST for questions and guidance. \nhttps://help.thule.com/s/contactsupport?language=en_US"

        "reviewBody": "I purchased the larger of the Escapist tarps (10&apos; x 10&apos;) a few years ago, and I love it. I have owned a number of tarps over the past 45 years or so, and this one is by far the best I have ever used. The material is very light, strong, and waterproof; the attachment points are very sturdy; and the attached cordage and adjusters are very helpful during setup. The one modification I&apos;ve made -- and I&apos;ve done this for every flat tarp I have ever owned -- is to add a center-point pullout. For that I use a small grip clip such as those offered by Shelter Systems. The center point is useful for increasing headroom, especially in poor weather when you want most or all edges low to the ground or even pinned to the ground on the windward side.\n\nI recommend getting the 10&apos;x10&apos; size if you intend to sleep two persons. \n\nMy wife and I use our tarp mostly as a dining fly (for 2 persons), so that we can eat away from our tent in bear country, protected from the weather. In rainy conditions, we may also set up or take down the tent under the tarp but normally use the tent in a separate location.\n\nI normally carry three or four lightweight stakes and two or three ounces of lightweight rope of various lengths (1&apos; to 40&apos;) to facilitate more setup options.",

They&apos;re see-through so you have to consider your underwear choice. I got caught in a downpour in them and they are marketed as &quot;quick dry&quot; but they still took a few hours to dry, and the elastic waistband was still wet the next morning (to note: the environment was very humid). Will wear them a lot, just maybe not in the rain.",

I will likely need my pants altered as the elastic waistband stretches out and/or my weight fluctuates. Kinda figured that could be an issue with these when I bought them, though.",

It is an absolute delight to wear as it is incredibly lightweight, yet provides ample warmth to keep me comfortable in chilly weather. What&apos;s more, the jacket serves a dual purpose - it can be worn as a mid-layer underneath a heavier coat on colder days or as a main layer in moderate weather. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this jacket to anyone looking for a versatile and cozy outerwear option.",

In the low 30s, it is comfortable with just a T-shirt under it, if sedentary.  \nBreathes pretty well, given how warm it is.\nPacks up pretty small, for a non-down coat\nFits and looks great\n\nCons-\nouter shell is too delicate.  I have gotten 2 rips just in the normal course of moving around.  If I&apos;m wearing this in the woods, it has to be as a mid layer.  \nIt packs up small enough - why not make it packable into its own pocket?  I had needing to find a stuff sack",

I wouldn&apos;t recommend wearing it under heavier rain but it&apos;s done just fine with light rain.\nThe inside pockets are VERY roomy you can definitely fit an object the size of a 1L/32oz water bottle in there.",

This Micro-puff jacket is also a medium, regular fit. The Micro-puff is noticeably bigger -- the body is much roomier and the sleeves are a bit longer. If Patagonia still had &quot;relaxed&quot; sizing, this would be a &apos;medium, relaxed fit&apos; item. For me, it&apos;s fine; others expecting the old &apos;nano-puff&apos; fit might be disappointed.\n\n2. Note that, unlike the nano, the micro doesn&apos;t have a zippered inner pocket :-(    Not sure why but Patagonia doesn&apos;t think we need zippered inside pockets in pretty much anything.\n\n3. Jacket works for my intended use. 4 Stars because no secure inside pocket.",
