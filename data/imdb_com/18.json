      "reviewBody": "Well, at the very least this film deserves more than the two lone commentaries here so far. While hardly relishing it the way the others have, it is surprising that a movie this good has gotten so little notice at this site, and for all I know maybe elsewhere. Because it sprang from a play, and a rather famous one at that, it has a certain staginess about it, no matter how deftly it has been opened up, and I am not at all sure that the principals were the right ones, good as they are. Nevertheless, there are many fine things about them and it, and it is certainly a better movie that a good eighty or ninety percent of the ones that came out during the fifties. Perhaps the clumsiness of the S and M stuff could have been softened into a little more subtlety, there is just too much of hip hop quality to it that does not seem felt, since Strindberg usually used a sledgehammer for that sort of thing, and almost had to from the narrow horizons of stage, words words words being all that he had at hand, but Sjoberg demonstrates such a fine feel for the camera that he could have turned it into something a lot more powerful. Also the limitations of budget seems a little evident, more or less working with what was in the neighborhood.\n\nStill this movie is not without its fascinations, and the childhood stuff has real nightmarish quality. Bergman&apos;s Naked Night had some very powerful stuff along the beach with the soldiers that was more obviously powerful, but the childhood stuff here was almost its equal. If you have not seen this Miss Julie, do yourself a favor. Its quite good.",

Much better than I expected.\n\nWings was restrained, Bo Hopkins good as usual and the other cast members fine. The two female leads were particularly good. They all took part in your usual chemicals contaminates town turning folks into murderous zombie type things sort of plot but the photography was atmospheric, the music creepy or emotional as appropriate, the make up scary and it all built up slowly but surely to a suspenseful ending. \n\nThe ordinariness of the setting makes it more frightening. It could be happening in the next town to you!",

Miley obviously doesn&apos;t have the talent or know how to act. I had nothing against her, but in this, the first role I&apos;ve seen her act in, it seemed like she was just playing herself and not playing any part that was written for her.\n\nThat said, &quot;The Last Song&quot; is a bust. It&apos;s a set of tired old recycled and clichéd experiences and really isn&apos;t worth the 107 minutes it takes to watch it. For the most part the storyline is so tired and old. And after watching it I was also disappointed that Greg Kinnear had signed up for it. That I can remember, I&apos;ve always liked his acting and the roles he chose. But in this case, the writing was so, so poor that even if the makers of &quot;The Last Song&quot; signed up the best actors in Hollywood it couldn&apos;t save this film. They&apos;d have to find some writers who were at a minimum mediocre-ish in order to improve this story.\n\nAll I can say is save yourself and watch something else.",

Co-stars donald pleasence as the israeli minister of defense. Ellen burstyn is the ambassador&apos;s wife, alex, and her naughty, night-time activities are make her husband&apos;s job much harder, when she is filmed. It&apos;s okay. Pretty low budget. Produced by golan globus, who have a record of making films on the cheap. Some dropped threads of storyline. Or maybe that was just poor editing. Topless women. And hudson&apos;s final film. We spend so much time on trying to get the film back, when hacker has already told everyone he doesn&apos;t care if it&apos;s shown on national television. Big, grand finale. Very symbolic of the actual situation. Directed by lee thompson.",

      "reviewBody": "Well, another of those crude and pathetic movies of the 1980s which today are sadly often cited as the worst examples for films which stamped this decade as the most terrible period in the history of mainstream Hindi cinema. From Kalu to Kaalia, from an innocent guy to a sophisticated gangster, and there you get another Bachchan hit. A clichéd and done-to-death story, a poor script filled with mindless action scenes and many melodramatic proceedings. It&apos;s a pity, considering Bachchan&apos;s achievements in the 1970s, when he proved his merit as an excellent actor and a star deserving of the resounding success he attained. Actually, here too Bachchan is not that bad; he is of course let down by the script but he also rises above its weakness in several sequences. It&apos;s just the choice of this film itself which disappoints (and he would appear in many movies unworthy of his abilities later in the decade). Where the film manages to provide some fun is, first, in the music. Well, that&apos;s to be expected when the one responsible for the soundtrack is R.D Burman. Secondly, the sequences portraying the romantic relationship between Bachchan and the exotic beauty Parveen Babi. These are the only worthy moments in the film, which also include the hilarious (not unintentionally, for a change) scene in which Babi breaks an egg on her own head, thinking this would help her to make an omelet. Babi&apos;s presence is one of the few positive aspects in this film. The film also has Asha Parekh, who is quite okay, but at times gets also a bit melodramatic, which is of course not her fault. To sum it up, Kaalia is just another wannabe gangster movie with the most predictable twists and neither Bachchan nor any of its other good points save it from being a cheapo.",

So I thought it is a misunderstood film, something disguised as something else and that has some deep or comedic meaning. I was wrong. It is simply a really bad movie. The only reason you might like it is for some really short and not very explicit nun rape or lesbian scenes. Yes, you read that right: some really ugly nuns are getting raped or are doing it with somebody. Occasionally they shoot people. All this with the same ridiculous music in the background. And I really do not care they are nuns one way or the other.\n\nConclusion: It is not something like a Rodriguez film, it is not posing as a terrible film, it is just what it seems: a really bad movie. In the fine tradition of recyclical &quot;creativity&quot;, it is just a clone of sexploitation films in the 60-70&apos;s. So avoid this.",

This is an elegant, fast-paced film drawing on some of the classiest comedy talent Germany had to offer at the time, and self-consciously modern, with its cocktails, ocean liners, racing car drivers and drop-dead art deco interiors. Anton Walbrook is suitably Errol Flynn-like as the handsome lady killer Phillip, while Heinz Ruehmann is for once overshadowed by his co-stars. It&apos;s the women who steal the show here, including the excellent Renate Mueller, who also starred in Viktor, Viktoria and habitually played modern, emancipated types. But the film belongs even more to Hilde Hildebrandt as the vampish Aimee, who better than anyone else in this ensemble piece knows how to camp it up to the max when necessary. The only mystery is why this film didn&apos;t come to the attention of Hollywood - and why Willi Forst&apos;s evident talent wasn&apos;t promptly snapped up by the US."

      "reviewBody": "Three kingdom: Resurrection of the Dragon tells about the legend of one famous General Zhao Yun in the Three Kingdom. But unfortunately, there are many flaws in this movie.\n\nFirst, this movie is a little bit off from the actual history. I never knew that Zhao Yun started his first career as a soldier directly under Liu Bei. He should been under a general name Gongsun Zan, before he changed his loyalty to Liu Bei. Then, there are Cao Ying and Luo Ping-An. Who the hell are they? Because as far as I know, the one who fought Zhao Yun in the last battle was Chao Zhen. \n\nSecondly, for the actor. I personally think that Andy Lau is well-suited as General Zhao Yun here. But the actor for both General Guan Yu and Zhang-Fei is a little bit out of the course. While the actor who casted as Guan Yu seems too old, the actor&apos;s face who cast as Zhang Fei seems so childish. And the actor who played as Zhuge Liang looks like a traditional physician instead of a strategist. Generally, I would say, the casting is a minus here (except for Andy Lau, of course) For the story, it lacks explanation. There&apos;s no explanation for any act inside. No briefing before wars, no strategy meeting before wars, no nothing. It just give off the conclusion of what is happening right now, and lead us directly into the war. That&apos;s all. And that too, is a minus.\n\nBut still, I like the war in this. That&apos;s why I still give this movie a rating of 6, instead of 5.\n\nNot good enough for all three kingdom fans. But if you&apos;re looking for just a war movies, than this is definitely for you.",

A lovely script, beautifully acted and kid actors that are actually quite good especially the lead boy whose story this film centers around.\n\nThe film is especially poignant now with so much misunderstanding and ignorance in the world.",

Proffy Liebowitz, a militant yet sensitive eleven year old wants nothing more than for the occupying British to get the hell out of his land. Proffy and his two friends spend most of their time plotting ways to terrorize and/or blow up the British until one evening, while he&apos;s out after curfew, Proffy is seized by Sergeant Dunlop, a British officer. Instead of arresting him, he deposits him back home,but what ensues in the weeks to come is a friendship between these two foes. Proffy looks to Dunlop as a father figure as his own father is cold and remote. Dunlop, lonely and poetic, loves the spirited boy and they find lots to talk about in their meetings which Proffy must keep a secret from his friends and family. When Proffy&apos;s friends follow him one day and see that he has been visiting the detested enemy, they report him to the town officials and Proffy is brought to &quot;trial&quot; for being a traitor. He is eventually found innocent but these experiences shape him for life;especially the shock that he could have such genuine affection for the enemy.",

All four are walking on eggshells.\n\nThe story is told without exposition. We are drip-fed just enough information to keep us engaged, and gave to work out some background for ourselves, being soared none of the anguish.\n\nWe English are stereotyped as having a stiff upper lip, but Claes and Britt take this to another level. Where Britt buries her grief, Claes bristles with suppressed rage to the point where we question his ability to function.\n\nThe story pulls no punches. There is no pretence of &apos;good&apos; and &apos;bad&apos;, only &apos;hurt&apos;. All major characters suffer crises of one form or another, but we empathise and want resolution for them.\n\nTwo minor characters, Malene and Ulrik, deserve particular credit.

Watching him tote a gun and rescue hostages is sort of sad.\n\nThis is not very funny and is a poor imitation of &quot;True Lies,&quot; released the same year.",

The problems with the film are numerous—poor choice of director, lame spoofery of other movies, Jimmy Nail—but perhaps the biggest mistake of all is that Smith and Jones, who worked so well together on the telly, remain separated for most of the running time, their unique chemistry sorely lacking.",

It&apos;s one of those irresistibly zany comedy-mysteries that, even though I have a copy of the film, I&apos;m happy to watch it if I stumble across it on TV (don&apos;t touch that dial! :-)). Despite a few groaners among the gags (how many times did they need to sniff for doggie-doo in the beginning?), there are enough witty lines (&quot;Communism was just a red herring!&quot; and &quot;Flames...on the side of my face...&quot;, among others, are frequently quoted in our home) delivered sparklingly by the top-notch cast amid enough madcap scampering about to make CLUE very watchable on a lazy afternoon, or even a not-so-lazy one, for that matter. Tim Curry (who deserves to be in more good movies) steals the show, particularly when he reenacts the entire movie in about 15 minutes during the climax, accompanied by John Morris&apos;s rollicking music. The film was released with three different endings, each of which has been shown on cable--the one that recalls MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is my favorite. Give CLUE a shot...in your living room...with the DVD player!",

      "name": "Mediocre ¨Quinqui¨ film  about  hold-ups  ,  survival and police corruption , including shocking finale",
      "reviewBody": "Violent film dealing with delinquency , robbing , dirty war , drug addiction and other dramatic events . Strong look about youthful criminality and based on real events , including political happenings in Spain from the 80s , being stared by a devoted to crime young who is living in slums . Hard-boiled film about juvenile delinquents , hold-ups and upon prison life where the starring -born in a marginal family- is harassed and humiliated until that fury and revenge emerge . It deals a delinquent nicknamed ¨El Nani¨ (Frédéric Deban who looks exactly like Alain Delon) , at the beginning he carries out a violent heist at a mall , after a frenetic car pursuit is detained . But Nani is chased and locked-up , accused for robbing , being led to Carabanchel jail . In prison is harassed by other inmates but he gets independence using his violent means of auto-defense . Later on , thanks to a bail he is freed and forced into street hustling and ever-expanding life of crime . Nani again hang out with his wife Lola (Eulàlia Ramon) and their child . Nani forms a criminal group with José Gálvez (Pedro Carrión) and Teo (Chema de Miguel) and execute heists in San Sebastian and León . They join forces with Richard (Fermí Reixach) , the jeweler Molero (Miguel Angel Salomon) along with El Marques and his wife (Yolanda Farr) who plan their armed robberies . All of them become involved with a high state power : the police command run by Manuel Soto (Albert Vidal) . Both of them scheme and carry out robberies to earn money in and around Madrid . As the trio of robbers attacks jewelries but the events get worse . With the change of government : power raising Felipe Gonzalez (1982) , the Socialist Interior Minister calls for more police control in jewelry robberies and stolen merchandises are located . The film was released in April 1988 , before the judgment of the Madrid Provincial Court in which sentenced three police officers to the disappearance of Santiago Corella .\n\nThis is mediocre look at delinquency and policy abuse , including shocking and dramatic ending . The film shows the widely dark police and underworld business , as well as the impunity of the security forces to crimes they commit themselves . Inspired by an actual case , giving a realistic look at delinquency world and life behind bars in ; however , the police events result to be imaginary and excessive . The best part is narrated into prison because of it reflects the astonishing existence of the convicts , with threats as well as violence and where rules the strongest&apos;s law . ¨Matar Al Nani¨ is one of several movies dealing with youth delinquency in Spain during the 70s and early 80s and it belongs to ¨sub-genre Quinqui¨ along with ¨Perros Callejeros I and II¨, ¨Perras Callejeras¨, ¨Los Ultimos Golpes Del Torete¨, ¨Yo el Vaquilla¨, mostly realized by Jose Antonio De La Loma , ¨Navajeros , &quot;Colegas&quot;, &quot;El Pico &quot; , and especially ¨Deprisa , Deprisa¨ by Carlos Saura and later on , ¨La Estanquera De Vallecas ¨ , among others . Most films mixed exploitation , nudity , violence , with asocial commentary . Drugs , delinquency , terrorism and generational problems are the habitual themes in this genre , and specially dedicated to the underworld of heroin . Seen today , these films are unique documents on how life was lived and perceived during that period . These flicks were notorious in the years of the Spanish transition to democracy including provoking and polemic issues and played by unknown young people . They still have the gritty edge , the naturalistic approach and the poignancy that made them successful at the time . At style is pretty much urban and realistic as well in the atmosphere as in the fresh happenings . We see their troubles growing in such streets , neighborhoods and some fine locations . These flicks show the ugliness of those &quot;barrios&quot; , toughness and cold existence of the humble people , including great looks at young life and friendship in the margined side , letting the stories flow efficiently and being realized in realistic style . Passing of time hasn&apos;t had mercy with most of those movies , but they represented a time and a way of life in history of Spain ; and now they may seem a little bit naive . ¨Matar Al Nani¨&apos;s screenplay written by prolific writer/director Vicente Escriba is such strong with disagreeable events , but it has not fidelity , neither accuracy , with events distortion and twisting deeds , spreading brutal tortures , including : hitting , punches , hanging , kick-ass and many other things . Filmmaker Bodegas chose young and natural actors who play middlingly their parts , unafraid of filmmaker&apos;s unsympathetic camera and the particularity of the characters . Atmospheric photography with juicy atmosphere by Fernando Arribas deemed to be one of the best Spanish cameramen .\n\nThe film was regularly directed by Roberto Bodegas with some flaws and gaps . In this work he shows how thin is the line between contention and excess , between drama and exploitation . Here Roberto attempted to take a position in favor of outcast people . Despite the expectation created among the population by the &quot;Case Nani&quot; is reflected , the film failed to attract a large number of spectators . Bodegas is a talented Spanish movies director , he began working in cinema in 1971, though he became notorious in the years of the Spanish transition to democracy with peculiar comedies called ¨3ª Via¨ , such as : ¨Españolas En Paris¨, ¨Vida Conyugal Sana¨ , ¨Los Nuevos Españoles¨ and ¨La Adultera¨ . His best film was ¨Libertad Provisional¨ stared by Concha Velasco .",

Villains Douglass Dumbrille and Damian O&apos;Flynn are very believable in ruthlessly trying to stop Autry from saving the forest. He&apos;s not getting much help from Jimmy Lloyd who finds out drinking and flying don&apos;t mix. Great to see Harry Cheshire who played Judge Ben Wiley in the TV series Buffalo Bill, Jr. and Clayton Moore, this time playing a henchman. Leon Weaver of The Weaver Brothers and Elviry even gets some great foot stomping music in along the way.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is the one film of the nineties which I can watch again and again without getting bored. That&apos;s not to say it&apos;s the best, no no no, but there&apos;s something about this movie which I just can&apos;t get enough of. It&apos;s easily the most frequently used tape in my limited video library.\n\nMainly it&apos;s the cast; quality names down the length of the list, and each one, from Robert Redford heading the motley crew of good guys (Dan Ackroyd and Sidney Poitier especially good) to Ben Kingsley as a deliciously cool but insecure villain. They&apos;re all clearly having such a good time as they&apos;re making the movie that you can&apos;t help but join them; it&apos;s infectious.\n\nIt&apos;s also surprisingly timeless. Seven years have passed since this movie came out, which is a long time in the gadget world in which this film is based, but none of their equipment or techniques (except a brief glimpse of a now outdated version of Windows but that&apos;s REALLY nitpicking) seem out of date; it could still be today.\n\nAnd then there&apos;s the moments. This is a film based on a whole load of brilliantly memorable moments. When they find out what the mysterious black box actually does, it&apos;s truly chilling. All the little tricks of their trade on display are each a delight, from setting off fire alarms to being on the other end of the phone when the fire service is subsequently called. And the ending, in my opinion, is one of the most satisfying, and hilarious, conclusions ever captured on film.\n\nIn case you hadn&apos;t noticed, I love this movie. A great score, a great cast, and a whole lot of fun. Whether you got to these comments because you want to know if this film was worth seeing, or whether a training shoe web-search somehow ended you up here against your will, you really should see this film. It&apos;s a hugely entertaining piece of the nineties. And Robert Redford has done nothing better since.",

      "reviewBody": "So I finally decided to give this a go and I have to say, I&apos;m a little annoyed I waited this long, because it&apos;s a very fun film.\n\nSo what put me off initially was that from the trailer it seemed a bit too silly and childish and I&apos;m not too fond of that humour. But I have to say it was done very well and I didn&apos;t find it daft at all.\n\nSo as my title says, I did find the film I little predictable. You could see what direction the film was heading in early doors and it never really veered from that path. I felt like it was just missing that &quot;wow&quot; factor to break this movie into 8/10 and beyond. It was very down the middle lane kind of film, which don&apos;t get me wrong there&apos;s nothing wrong with that. But I just wanted a little more.\n\nSticking with the plot theme. It kept me entertained throughout and I remained interested for the entire 2 hours or so. So clearly it did something right! My only negative on this subject was that I thought they expanded in the wrong areas. So the first 45 mins or so was developing the characters so we didn&apos;t even see &quot;Shazam&quot; until 45 mins in. Then it sort of whizzed through the &apos;dealing with the idea he has powers&apos; phase and went straight into the overly long end sequence. I feel like they could have done more with the mid section and even shortened the beginning and end to do so.\n\nBeyond that though I thought the characters were great and they were all likeable and the arcs were also fun and interesting to get stuck in. And overall it was just enjoyable and a fun watch. It does what you expect it to do! The humour isn&apos;t over the top, stupid nor overdone and it&apos;s not complicated either. Yeah I&apos;d recommend this if you&apos;re debating it. It&apos;s enjoyable!",

But hunger of public for films was great as in countries from the west, especially for action films and western. In Yugoslavia communist authorities try with some action films called &quot;partiaznski filmovi&quot; (partisan films) made substitution for actions films from west. In this manner made this film. But Yugoslavia was something else from others countries behind &quot;iron curtain&quot; and filmmakers have some kind of freedom in they artistic attempt. This film was one in the series of action films (partizanski filmovi) where with some most popular actor in this time in Yugoslavia, Aleksandar Gavric ( whose appearance remind on film stars from USA) , made brake trough in freedom in social realistic film industry. Story based on realistic event was presented to the public in the manner of good action film, of course in regard to place and time where and when was made. The sixties was years when Tito opened Yugoslavia&apos;s borders and film from the West Europe (Italian and French films) and USA come back in Yugoslav&apos;s movie theaters but partisans films stay with they popularity together with best films from the west for most film fans in Yugoslavia. This film for me has historical value as artistic because it describe some realistic event in the time of  WWII and describe time when this film was made."

This is the limit of the current cinema in Italy. we have no sense of irony, then you can have only from one side the desperation of Gomorrah, and on the other &quot;plastic&quot; comedies like this one. It is very difficult to find popular movies comparable with the old Italian masterpieces. The characters are not credible and not funny. This movie depicts a more stereotypical vision of the Italian than the Sopranos&apos; TV series - By the way, it is curios that a TV-serial made in US is more effective to depict some of the Italian culture than movies made in Italy. As Italians, we have no way to reflect to our conditions, improve ourselves and avoid to be stuck to the same old stereotypes: Pizza,Sole,Mandolino with the difference that in this movie Mafia is just a fiction - a set inside the set just to save Alberto&apos;s marriage - this is very sad, and not funny at all."

      "reviewBody": "If you manage to not be annoyed during its opening minutes that features a deranged asshole with suicidal tendencies putting up an extraordinary display of craziness before killing himself by getting run over by a train, you just might be able to enjoy Peppermint Candy and even end up being impressed by it too. Told in reverse chronology, this film covers the past 20 years in the life of that stupid maniac &amp; depicts the events that eventually led to his suicide while also showing that he was not such a weirdo from the beginning but was slowly transformed into one by the Korean &apos;system&apos;.\n\nNicely directed by Lee Chang-dong for the manner he has narrated this story, well-written too for how the events depicted in the life of the protagonist clash with relevant moments of Korean history, manically performed by its lead actor that also included few moments where he went completely over the top &amp; was hamming like a freak, and displaying fine technical execution throughout its runtime, Peppermint Candy is a sad portrait of a young life wasted away by cynicism &amp; loss of love that didn&apos;t really work as well as I would&apos;ve liked &amp; eventually felt much longer than its runtime."

      "reviewBody": "Such is the impact of Lionel Jeffries magical 1970 film version of `The Railway Children&apos; that I can well recall the time my grandfather dragged me from my play to watch one of his favourite movies when it was first screened on television.  A quarter of a century later as a father of a small boy my interest has been revived and I find myself becoming something of a railway child once more.  The number of privately restored railways that exist conveniently to hand, as though to undermine Dr Richard Beeching&apos;s efficiency cuts of the 1960&apos;s, further help this pastime.  Most notable of these is the Bluebell Railway in Sussex, one of the first and best known revived lines, used by Catherine Morshead for Carlton TV&apos;s remake of this movie in 2000.  The actual location used for this first film was in Bronte country with the Haworth Parsonage passing for the doctor&apos;s house, though the true star was the Keighly and Worth Valley Railway which had been reopened by volunteers six years after its closure in 1962.  This film was well liked by the younger generation besotted with all things `Thomas the Tank Engine&apos;, including `Thomas and the Magic Railway&apos; an all American reworking of Rev W Awdry&apos;s creation starring Alec Baldwin and Henry Fonda, serving to add to the ever growing collectable models now available.\n\nA middle class family lose their government official of a father on spying charges and are forced to adjourn to the country in reduced circumstances to a wonderful house that many would dream of living in.  Being spared incarceration in a school, the fate of most of today&apos;s children, they fully enjoy their privileged freedom and have some adventure through befriending the neighbouring railway line.  A word of caution should however be issued regarding the landslide and near train crash, which had a disturbing effect on the younger viewer, though undoubtedly in a different sense to that imprinted on the minds of some older fans.  The moment when Jenny Agutter as the pristine heroine Bobby faints dead away after powerfully arresting the train is matched in the lump-in-the-throat stakes when she runs along the platform for the reunion with her father with her immortal cry of &quot;Daddy, my Daddy&quot;.\n\nBefore returning to the UK to star in The Railway Children, Agutter had spent three months touring the Australian Outback for the filming of Walkabout and being disconsolate about where society was going was unsure of doing the film, but fortunately she was charmed by the director&apos;s vitality. He had been encouraged by his daughter to turn the book into a film and Agutter was a natural choice having already played the part of Bobbie two years earlier for a BBC serial. The film provided Agutter her breakthrough first part in the National Theatre four years later as Shakespeare&apos;s Miranda, opposite Sir John Gielgud&apos;s Prospero, in `The Tempest&apos;.  This in turn led to an eighteen year career in the US, with such memorable films as the cult sci-fi  `Logan&apos;s Run&apos; and the successful horror and humour cross in `An American Werewolf in London&apos;, as well as one of her personal favourite creations as the ill-used Ann in Beryl Bainbridge&apos;s strangely unromantic `Sweet William&apos;.  As well as being official patron of the Edith Nesbit and The Railway Children website, Agutter has been working on a dramatisation of the author&apos;s life, and would seem the obvious choice for the role having such a deep professional connection.  Sally Thomsett winsomely squeezes her notoriously corseted twenty-year-old frame into the role of the younger sister Phyllis, some six years her junior, and her brother Peter is an ably suited Gary Warren.  A very graceful Dinah Sheridan is Mrs Waterbury, the mother, whilst Bernard Cribbins creates a manic porter in Perks.\n\nAs a teenager Edith Nesbit lived for three years at Halstead Hall, near Knockholt Station in Kent with its deep railway cuttings and tunnels and about half an hour from London, which is believed to have given her the inspiration for her famed novel.  Nesbit&apos;s use of her plain initial for her writing disguised her gender back in 1906 and whether or not this was a conscious intention it led to her occasionally being thought a male writer. Why J K Rowling of Harry Potter fame should chose to do the same nearly a century later escapes me especially as the identity behind any pseudonym is easily uncovered today?  Possibly it is to do with the tradition of male fantasy writers using only their initials, as in such luminaries as J M Barrie, C S Lewis, and J R R Tolkein.  Women writers today surely don&apos;t face the same difficulties and social barriers that the Bronte sisters and George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) had, being forced to take masculine nom de plumes in order to get their work published, but do they fear that male readers will automatically be deterred if the work is obviously by a girl&apos;?   Conversely it is a man, who coyly disguises his gender presumably for a female market, that has written the romantic novels of Emma Blair.  Curiously, whilst the Brontes have subsequently been published under their own names rather than their Bell aliases, George Eliot&apos;s work has not been liberated in this way. If literature, that previously anonymous and faceless industry, enabling women to compete on an equal footing, continues the current invidious marketing trend of promoting works by beautiful and youthful authors rather than on the merits of the works alone, then how can any other industry ever stand a hope of breaking the sexist and ageist glass ceilings?\n\nThe legacy of this film and the book continues with its name being used by a Wigan based pop group in 1984, and in 1995 for the very worthy charity for vulnerable youngsters arriving alone at railway stations in some of the world&apos;s poorest countries.  The film still represents family entertainment at its best with nostalgia for another time and place enhancing the tale."

In retrospect, it may be that Julian was wrong: it may have indeed been the very presence of these terrible weapons that prevented a third world war.\n\nIn any case, that aspect of the story never overshadows the movie&apos;s underlying theme, which is, rather, how each of us views the sum of our lives as our mortal end approaches. Are we alone? Have we connected with anyone? Have we failed? Have we loved? Have we been loved?\n\nColor would have been all wrong for this essentially b&amp;w story. Superb performances from Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire and the pre-Norman Bates Anthony Perkins. A fine bit as well by John Tate as the old admiral(&quot;to a blind, blind world&quot;).\n\nA mere cold-war nuclear destruction movie would leave one merely frightened at the end. The fact that this movie leaves you with an almost unbearable feeling of terrible sadness is a testament to the human power of Nevil Shute&apos;s book, as well as to the fine script and Kramer&apos;s superb direction.\n\nOne of the most depressing movies ever made, but a truly great one.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m probably in the minority here... but I always preferred Eric Idle of the members of the Monty Python gang. The more talented writer, both in sketch material and song lyrics(to any other Python fan who appreciates those; Yes, Idle wrote and performed the main theme), the better facial expressions and acting. Naturally, when I found out that he had written and starred in a film of his own(though John Cleese does also have a role), I had to watch it. I don&apos;t believe I ever did get to watch this more than a few times, some years back, and then I didn&apos;t really go back to it until today. As much as I like Idle, I have to admit that this isn&apos;t up to the standards of most of the Pythons&apos; movies or Flying Circus episodes. The basic idea is fun enough; I won&apos;t reveal it here, though, since it is an important plot point(and I urge anyone reading this to not read any of the cast credits on the main page... and if you&apos;ve already done so, try your best to forget what you read). The plot certainly isn&apos;t brilliant, but it&apos;s quite funny, and makes for some highly comical situations. The pacing is actually fairly solid. I can&apos;t think of any point in the film where I was genuinely bored... in spite of knowing everything that would happen. The acting is all very good. The characters are quite well-written, though I guess few of them are particularly likable. The humor is quite black, and some will definitely be offended. I&apos;m not fond of admitting it, but Cleese actually has some of the funniest moments of the entire film. He&apos;s not very prominently featured, but he is hilarious when he is on-screen. Moranis is about as tolerable as usual... I don&apos;t feel much neither for nor against him, but if you don&apos;t care for him, you won&apos;t like him in this, either. Idle gets to both under- and overplay, and his presence was definitely the selling point of the movie for me. All in all, some very funny moments, but only just enough to make it worth watching. I recommend it to huge fans of the Monty Python crew, in particular those fond of Idle and Cleese. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "In 1915 Germany, burly trapeze artist Emil Jannings (as Stephan &quot;Boss&quot; Huller) leaves his wife and partner for sultry young Lya de Putti (as Berta-Marie). Soon, the carnival performing pair are hired by famed trapezist Warwick Ward (as Artinelli), after his flying brother is derailed by a fall. The high swinging threesome is an immediate success. But, after his trimmer partners begin to take care of their mutual attraction, Mr. Jannings must commit the crime for which he serves ten years in prison - as revealed in the present-day prologue. No doubt, it&apos;s going to get nasty \n\nAppearing decidedly middle-aged, and with his overweight figure impossible to disguise, Jannings is miscast to the point of ridiculous. But, he was so popular most viewers accepted Jannings as the trim athletic &quot;catcher&quot; flying high. For American consumption, Paramount left out Jannings&apos; adulterous first act (and trimmed the remainder of the film). This softens Jannings&apos; character, of course. The film cutters did leave in some flashes of female nipple. That, Jannings, and some great camera-work from Karl Freud made &quot;Varieté&quot; a critical and commercial success in the US.\n\n****** Varieté (11/16/25) E.A.

      "reviewBody": "This is the story of two men in England in the late 1800&apos;s. Algernon Moncrieff (Rupert Everett) lives primarily in the city, while his good friend Jack Worthing (Colin Firth) lives primarily in the country. Jack calls himself Earnest when he is in the city, so Algernon calls him that. Jack also uses the name Earnest to refer to an imaginary brother who lives in the city and always needs assistance, giving him an excuse to go to the city. Similarly, Algernon is always leaving the city to attend to an imaginary friend named Bunbury.\n\nJack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax (Frances O&apos;Connor from &quot;Artificial Intelligence: AI&quot;), who lives in the city and therefore knows him as Earnest. Gwendolen&apos;s mother is Lady Bracknell (Judi Dench), who is also Algernon&apos;s aunt. And the final main character is Cecily Cardew (Reese Witherspoon), who is Jack&apos;s ward, and who Algernon introduces himself to as Earnest. This of course makes sense to Cecily because she knows of Jack&apos;s brother (but obviously not that he is imaginary).\n\nThere is more to the story, but I don&apos;t want to give away too much, not that the story is really the important thing anyway. This is a comedy and not a serious period drama, and what makes it work is the dialog, which is based on the play of the same name by Oscar Wilde and adapted for the screen by the film&apos;s director, Oliver Parker. I enjoyed it more than I expected to, but I have not read the play or seen any other adaptations. My wife, who has, was disappointed, because apparently too little of Wilde&apos;s words remain in the finished product.\n\nThe acting talent is first rate, including, in addition to those mentioned above, Tom Wilkinson from &quot;In the Bedroom.&quot; They do very well with the material, but it&apos;s so light you don&apos;t think about the skill required.\n\nThe bottom line is that this film is a good choice if you are looking for something frothy and entertaining, yet respectable, and you keep your expectations fairly low.\n\nSeen on 7/15/2002.",

American Ambassador Gregory Peck has come up with an idea after his new-born son dies at birth: he decides to pass another child off to wife Lee Remick as their own. Life in England seems grand for a few years, but as the child becomes a toddler (in the form of the young Harvey Stephens) strange murders start to occur. The child is really the son of Satan, born of a goat, and his only goal is to grow up and take over the world for his unearthly father. As the truth slowly unfolds, the film twists into disturbing murders and highly unholy situations. Not a film for the faint of heart and certainly not a perfect film, but still one of the stronger films of the usually luke-warm genre. 4 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "As the last millennium comes to a close and a new one opens, the science fiction genre seems to have latched onto a brand new narrative format - the cyber/techno thriller, wherein characters are free to wander in and out of virtual reality worlds and are even forced to call into question the validity of the world we have hitherto smugly referred to as &quot;reality.&quot;\n\nIn 1999 alone, this theme has been explored in &quot;The Matrix&quot;,  &quot;eXistenZ&quot; and &quot;The Thirteenth Floor.&quot;  Actually, of the three, this is probably the most intriguing, intelligent and involving, successfully combining the elements of a whodunit with a clever sci-fi tale of a group of characters who drift in and out of a simulated version of Los Angeles in 1937.  The plot, though complex, is spun out with coherence and ever-increasing clarity as the layers of information are slowly peeled back to reveal the larger picture. The filmmakers manage to create a sense of unbalance in the audience as we and the characters become more and more unclear as to what is reality and what is a simulation.  Because the writers never lose their way, the result is a work of considerable mystery and intrigue.\n\nIn terms of art direction and cinematography, the film is a total triumph. The Los Angeles of 1937 the moviemakers have visualized on screen actually has a slight studio backlot, artificial feel to it - perfectly befitting just the kind of world a simulator would create.  The photography in these sections also utilizes a slightly off color cast, nicely reflecting the tone found in color pictures of that era.\n\n&quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; may not be a very &quot;deep&quot; movie, but it is an honorable addition to a newly formed genre that has not yet had time to ossify in its own conventions.  Time alone will tell if filmmakers will be able to expand on this theme or whether, as with most genres, it will fall victim to its own inevitable cliches."

      "name": "A Freudian allegory",
      "reviewBody": "A petty bourgeois (Eugen Klöpfer) waits in the parlour while his wife (Lucie Höflich) prepares dinner in the kitchen. Lying on the sofa, he watches the shadows cast on the ceiling by the events outside his window. He can&apos;t resist the allure for long. He is drawn outside, into the street, into a completely unbourgeois adventure. He doesn&apos;t go with the first streetwalker straight away, but soon after he meets a young lady (Aud Egede Nissen) in a dance hall, whose protector (Anton Edthofer) tempts him into gambling. After several entanglements, our bourgeois returns to his cosy home, dishevelled and happy to embrace his wife and finally eat the dinner that has been kept warm for him.\n\nKarl Grune&apos;s film &apos;Die Straße&apos; is often counted among the canon of &apos;expressionist&apos; films of the Weimar Republic and there are good reasons for this, as Grune works with many of the genre&apos;s set pieces. The face of a prostitute is transformed into a skull through a dissolve. The elements of metropolitan life rotate before our eyes in a kaleidoscopic multiple exposure. The scenery alternates between realism and stylization. The sign above the door of the police station is adorned with meaningless symbols and an optician has placed an oversized pair of glasses in front of his shop, the eyes of which appear to be critically observing what is happening in the street.\n\nHowever, this accumulation of stylistic elements contrasts with a rather banal and unoriginal story. From the moment the petty bourgeois leaves his flat, it is easy to guess that the street of the title does not only have positive experiences in store for him. Basically, the protagonist follows a programme familiar from plays, novels and other films: he plunges into a world unknown to him, is humiliated and gets into danger. The outcome of the whole thing is unknown at times, but it is almost disappointingly inconsequential for the petty bourgeois, because not even the soup has got cold.\n\n&apos;The Street&apos; is a rather simple allegory. The characters and situations are all clichéd and the film doesn&apos;t offer enough expressionistic elements to be convincing on this level. What lifts it is the performance by Eugen Klöpfer, who at times adds tension to the plot and at least gives his character his own flavour. As a philistine in a three-piece suit with a stiff collar, he always carries an umbrella with him, and the way he carries it could - if one were inclined towards Freudian theory - be seen as an expression of an unrealised petty bourgeois lust, which would logically be identified as the driving force behind the entire plot. In 1983, Volker Schlöndorf spoke about the film in an article for Deutschlandfunk about the &apos;eternally pubescent, who briefly rebel and then submit&apos;. This describes the protagonist of &apos;Street&apos; exactly.",

      "reviewBody": "What p****s me off about this film is that it, like &quot;Metropolis&quot;, is a forgotten one.  Why?  Why is it that everything has to be razzle-dazzle eye candy, instead of a subtle, beautiful, fine piece of craftsmanship and storytelling.  &quot;Becket&quot; was tough to watch, because of all the grain and clicks on the neglected print.  But past all of the distortion of a neglected print, I found a very remarkable and exquisite achievement that ranks among some of the best films ever made!  The craftsmanship is just the beginning!  It gets better!  Peter O&apos;Toole, who ironically, played Henry II years later in &quot;A Lion in Winter&quot;, does a superb job.  He&apos;s so angry, volatile, and above all, whiny.  When I saw the Disney version on &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, with Peter Ustinov playing the voice of the whiny Prince John, I felt it was directly inspired by Peter O&apos;Toole&apos;s Henry II!  He was so good at being a great whiner.  And Richard Burton, as Thomas Becket, looks so reserved, strong, and reverent, as a friend of Henry II who&apos;s faith and belief in God and serving the people, brings a rift in their friendship. I also felt bad that not only was this a crappy print, but also that the beautiful photography seemed so small on the TV.  This is the kind of film that needs to be seen on the big screen in  order to fully appreciate it. I hope that this gets some more respect and popularity, because it needs it and it has deserved it for years!"

Too much is foresees and unbelievable...you know what will happens from the beginning and that doesn&apos;t change... But you can look at this film...when you don&apos;t want to make any &quot;brain-work&quot; - or want to get off some stress ! It&apos;s good Popcorn-maintenance.\n\nNice to see Arnold Vosloo in one of his earlier role (18 min. from the whole film)...but always the bad guy ! Damn !",

While understandable, it&apos;s not really a fair assessment. While both deal with spirits using modern technology to exact their revenge, Phone is more a story about personal betrayal and revenge that uses the supernatural as a means of exposing the actions of the living characters. It&apos;s not really groundbreaking, but overall I found it to be a very enjoyable film.\n\nSpecial recognition, in my opinion, should go to Seo-woo Eun, who played Yeong-ju.

I believe it got such awful review from critics because it starred a lot of big name actors and maybe they expected more substance from them; but you have to look at the source material before making those determinations. This is a tongue-in-cheek slapstick comedy that&apos;s meant to entertain people especially those who grew up in the 80&apos;s and can relate to the video game evolution nostalgia of that time. If you watch this movie with that mindset, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "Right, well I stumbled upon the 2013 Norwegian horror movie &quot;O&apos;Hellige Jul&quot; (aka &quot;Christmas Cruelty&quot;) here in 2022. And seeing the movie&apos;s cover, I immediately picked it up and decided to give it a view. And it being a Norwegian horror movie just made it all the more interesting.\n\nWriters Eline Aasheim, Janne Iren Holseter, Anita Nyhagen, Magne Steinsvoll and Per-Ingvar Tomren put together a very unique and entertaining script and storyline here. The movie starts out rather violently, but then takes a turn for a more strange and somewhat weird storyline. And that had me wondering why this was actually a horror movie. But then directors Per-Ingvar Tomren and Magne Steinsvoll brings the violence back threefold, so stick with the movie, even while the narrative is a bit strange.\n\nIt is hard to describe a movie such as &quot;O&apos;Hellige Jul&quot;, because it has to be seen and experienced to fully understand. And believe you me, this is definitely a movie that I will warmly recommend for all you gorehounds out there. I&apos;ve never seen a Norwegian movie this bloody before.\n\nThe acting performances in the movie were quite good, despite the fact that the majority of the performers were also either directors and/or writers. Usually that is something I frown upon, but they pulled it off quite nicely here actually.\n\nThere is an abundance of violence in &quot;O&apos;Hellige Jul&quot;, and it is quite visual and visceral, so the movie may not find an appeal with everyone in the audience, especially not those of delicate demeanor.\n\nMy rating of &quot;O&apos;Hellige Jul&quot; lands on a well-deserved six out of ten stars.",

      "reviewBody": "In a time when forming an opinion over an explored topic or a famous or infamous individual are the routine of documentaries, it&apos;s a little refreshing to look back at old documentaries due to its level of artistry involved, and the use of factual information in a discreet and educational manner. It feels completely different than what&apos;s being put at the center stage in recent years, yet it&apos;s riveting and fascinating just as much. The film concerning legendary boxer Jack Johnson (1878-1946) and directed by William Cayton allows viewers to form their own opinions on the subject matter, his life, his successes and failures as a black boxer during the period of segretation, the several controversies surrounding fixed fights and his relationships with white females, and unusual yet fun anedoctes during his down-and-out days.\n\nNominated for an Oscar in the Best Documentary, Features category (losing out to the monumental &quot;Woodstock&quot;, truly deserving but almost without comparison), &quot;Jack Johnson&quot; is presented through a series of varied archive footage from the 1900&apos;s showing Johnson&apos;s many important fights, starting with the wins over white boxers which greatly divided the American society of that period to the point of race riots and threats take place.\n\nJohnson&apos;s words in the media are performed by veteran actor Brock Peters (&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;) in a great manner; obviously they couldn&apos;t use James Earl Jones as he was busy filming &quot;The Great White Hope&quot;, a fictional story based on Jack Johnson. And as soundtrack to everything, the genius Miles Davis during his rock/jazz/funk fusion in the early 1970&apos;s offers a nice spectacle that works with the piece. Those two 1970&apos;s elements somehow fit with the whole presentation that, visually, looks as something made decades before that, almost like those old newsreels.\n\nThe use of those archive images are amazingly well-done as the director manipulates the material with care, attention and even allowing viewers to watch some of the most thrilling bits of the fights by repeating frames in slow motion, detailing those parts when a special attention is required since punches and reactions can confuse audiences. Did he threw that punch in such spectacular fashion? Did he really lost that fight on purpose and somehow everybody was fooled? Mr. Cayton answers those questions, while Peters narration confirms what really happened as Johnson reflects about his fights many years later when his career was fully decadent.\n\nBesides the boxing matches and the problems with women and the law, the surprising moments related with his apparently random trips to Mexico, Cuba and Russia (where he met with the infamous Rasputin) are responsible for some of the funny and amazing bits. That&apos;s his level of popularity around the world back in the day, but they all happened as he was escaping from the law or trying to get new fights since he wasn&apos;t allowed in America for a period.\n\nAgain, there isn&apos;t any form of &apos;in your face&apos; kind of opinion in the film. Was Johnson a hero or a villain? An inspiring figure that succumbed to fame and money or someone that needed to prove anything to himself, to his race or others? The rise and fall are so enormous, so dramatically vivid that one can&apos;t deny his importance, both as a sportist and also a man living on harsh times. 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "London, 1955. Professor Marcus (Alex Guinness) plans to rob two armored cars with the help of a gang of crooks, played by an ensemble group of actors. They include: Louis (Herbert Lom), The Mayor (Cecil Parker), One-Round (Danny Green) and Harry (Peter Sellers). None of the men have previously met each other, but join together for the single heist.\n\nTheir strategic planning takes place in the upstairs of a Victorian home owned by Mrs. Wilberforce (Katie Johnson), a somewhat eccentric older woman who is under the impression that Professor Marcus and his &quot;friends&quot; are part of a music orchestra and unite daily to rehearse. This leads to a film comprised of misconceptions, confusion, and bumbling antics, as the Professor has to spend more of his time keeping Mrs. Wilberforce off their backs than devoting it to planning the robbery.\n\nThe film shares resemblance to Danny DeVito&apos;s &quot;Duplex&quot; in the scenes where Mrs. Wilberforce continuously interrupts the criminals&apos; scheming, asking them to run errands for her. They reluctantly put up with her constant irritating questions and demands, since she is unknowingly a vital ingredient of their plan. They must use Mrs. Wilberforce in their robbery, and after a while she realizes this, then demands that they return the money, which leads them to the conclusion that they must kill the old woman or else risk losing their entire fortune. However, their constant mistakes and arguments only postpone the inevitable, and it soon seems that the group of tough guys aren&apos;t so tough after all. &quot;I can&apos;t! I can&apos;t!&quot; screams one of the criminals when he pulls the shortest toothpick and is handed the task of &quot;whacking&quot; the poor sweet lady.\n\nAll actors are at their peeks here -- Guinness as the Professor is superb, but Sellers in his screen debut is especially noteworthy. The script by William Rose relies on macabre humor rather than constant slapstick. Admittedly, I expected the former when I sat down to see the film, although I came away rather surprised at its sophistication.\n\nThe Coen Brothers remade the film in 2004, although the remake failed to capture the essence of this dark comedy. Made before political correctness (in the Coens&apos; version there is the token black character of course), this is a delightfully irreverent black comedy. To be fair, most of the jokes don&apos;t hold up as well nowadays. It does not deliver a constant barrage of jokes, but rather a steady mix of black humor and plot -- a very good plot, too. One that keeps our interest and quite often manages to make us smile. &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; is a rare treat, better than the remake, a classic of the genre, and something that will be remembered years from now. It&apos;s a real gem of a movie, hard to devote long paragraphs to, much easier to devote 100 minutes of your life to."

It is the shame that the DOP work was disastrous, lack of stage direction, lack of right camera movement, incorrect framing , lack of actors direction and not even a good engaging editing . This movie could have been positioned one of the top 30 movies in the world , this movie could have been compared with blade runner at some point but the movie director wasn&apos;t chosen wisely and did destroy the whole work.\n\nFinally the production design team did a very good job and it was right for purpose of this movie.",

Angie Harmon plays a very convincing role as a troubled mother &amp; keeps you squirming in your seat. Shes backed up well by Joel Gretsch as her doting husband, with a very fine performance from unknown Jordon Hinson. The plot it self is a very simple one &amp; its been seen before in a number of good movies, but this doesn&apos;t take anything away from the excitement or suspense. The characters all develop well as the story unfolds, &amp; still gives you a ending with a surprise twist. Its a very entertaining effort, its no blockbuster but I,m sure it will be well received in video stores.",

You know, I watched this movie first time a year ago, and rated it 7, and when I rewatched it yesterday, I was socked how I could have &apos;insulted&apos; this movie that much, maybe I can say I was not attentive enough during my first watch (though that&apos;s a lame excuse, as yesterday my eyes were glued to the screen)... Let&apos;s say I wasn&apos;t in the right state of mind for this movie at that time... I am glad I suddenly decided to rewatch it yesterday. The cinematography is so perfect, there were scenes my breath was caught somewhere in my throat... The colors (if you decide to watch it just download it, and preferably HD, the bigger the file, the better, trust me) were driving me crazy! The hill on which they placed the mailbox became one of the places I want to visit before I die, it&apos;s the most beautiful, peaceful place! The way they shot it at least made me want to go there,sometimes it seemed I could even see the wind blowing the grass and the hair of two lonely characters standing there... The plot is simple, and honestly I didn&apos;t need more complicated, as the scenes were so rich visually, other complications were unnecessary... Acting is wonderful! As a big fan of Han Hyo-Joo, one more time came to adore her character. First thing about JaeJoong I noticed was his husky voice, which drove me crazy, I was WAITING for him to talk... I think he was a perfect person to portray JaeJoon... The music is very complimentary to the movie, perfect match... calm, relaxing and light... Also the symbolic meaning of the movie adds to it value so much more... White lies to help people, is it right or wrong? Teaching a lesson by making the person to look at life from a whole another angle of life... Learning how to withstand the difficulties of life from zero... falling in love after being hurt...falling in love...^^",

Another case of sneaky alien scum duping the human race, the aliens in this case appear human at first and the only way to tell them apart from humans is that they don&apos;t feel pain. The film starts out in the future where our hero is bravely battling the alien menace (and so totally losing) he then gets sent back in time by some desperate scientists to avert the original alien take over. Okay fairly predictable. This is the sort of flick that at best is a guilty pleasure, so bad its hysterically funny. The &apos;scientific base&apos; of the plot is ridiculous. The effects are &apos;good enough&apos; -remember it was 1992- so considering the times no real complaints there. The actors are less than good but slightly above god awful. All in all I&apos;d say rent it with a grin, don&apos;t expect any awards and its running time may seem like a prison sentence at times but remember, you&apos;re name isn&apos;t attached to this lovable junker so feel free to turn it off and catch your breath, you&apos;re going to be laughing, A LOT."

You have some of Vietnam&apos;s most beautiful actresses in sensual scenes as well as a sympathetic tone towards the male &quot;playa.&quot;\n\nWhat changes this film from average to great is the ending. Just when you were expecting some cliché happy ending to take place, the plot shifts towards a feminist perspective through one of the female leads. \n\nBig twists are not common in this genre but the film uses it effectively to be memorable.",

      "reviewBody": "A drifter (Clint Eastwood) comes to a mining village in the Old West just in time to reckoning gunslingers and owners . He is a mysterious preacher who comes to the aid of gold prospectors and protects a humble embattled prospector (Michael Moriarty) and his woman (Carrie Snodgres) from a greedy mining company (ruled by LaHood , Richard Dysart, and his son Josh LaHood , Chris Penn) trying to encroach on their land . Meanwhile , the Good Stranger is idolized by their daughter named Megan (Sydney Penny). As the wealthy owner contracts a group of outlaws as hired gunfighters (led by John Russell who also acted as villain in Rio Bravo) to kill miners . The title ¨The Pale Rider¨ refers to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from the Book of Revelation, chapter six , Megan is reading the exact verse when she and her mom first see Preacher ride up to their house. \n\nWell crafted Western with interesting screenplay written by Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack . Although atmospheric , it&apos;s also sometimes slow-moving and winds up into a spectacular showdown . This stirring picture contains a powerful examination of morality and hypocrisy on people as well as an enjoyable message about faith and hope . Clint Eastwood is unforgettable in the title role coming to help a group of struggling miners and homesteaders . Clint Eastwood revealed in interviews that his character is in fact a ghost. Other clues to the Preacher&apos;s true nature are the ghastly bullet wound scars seen when he is dressing, and his sudden appearances and disappearances throughout the movie . During shooting, Clint Eastwood sustained what he describes as the worst injury he has ever had on set when a horse he was riding fell through thin ice and launched him forward as Clint suffered a dislocated shoulder . Good casting with several secondaries as Carrie Snodgress , Chris Penn , Doug McGrath , Richard Kiel , Charles Hallahan , Billy Drago and special mention to John Russell as a downright nasty. Exquisitely shot in Panavision by Bruce Surtees , son of classic cameraman Robert Surtees , with a magnificent cinematography on the wooded exteriors and snowy mountains backgrounds. Acceptable production design by veteran Edward Carfagno , though the train station built for production was used again late in 1988 for Back to the Future Part III . Thrilling as well as sensitive musical score by Lennie Niehaus . The film is made in somewhat similar style to ¨Shane¨ by George Stevens , and which so much cloning of ¨High plains drifter¨ also directed by Eastwood only this time the drifter appears to have been sent from hell rather than heaven to right from ordinary injustices . Star, producer , filmmaker Eastwood realizes an excellent film and perfectly directed . This classic Western as good as the notorious ¨Josey Wales¨ is splendid in every way . Later on , Eastwood produced and directed another successful Western ¨Unforgiven(1992)¨ also with some common theme.",

      "reviewBody": "A.A. Milne&apos;s Winnie the Pooh stories captivated me as a child and they are still wonderful stories through young adult eyes. The stories epitomise childhood innocence, the atmosphere is enough to enchant everybody regardless of gender and age and the characters are some of the most charming in children&apos;s literature (Disney&apos;s treatment of them as some of their most famous ever creations is every bit as special).\n\nWanted to see &apos;Christopher Robin&apos; from the very start, being as big a fan as all things Winnie the Pooh. Despite giving away too much of the film for my liking, the trailer did look good and the charm and childhood innocence did shine through even with the obvious melancholic tone that comes with growing up and forgetting. Ewan McGregor has big talent as an actor, the idea was such a great one and Winnie the Pooh is just such a great character that is impossible to dislike. Also wanted to see where abouts in the mixed to positive critical reception it would land in, though a few negative reviews, from reviewers usually trusted by me, put me off a little.\n\nAm so glad about following my gut instinct and watching the film. &apos;Christopher Robin&apos; has its faults, and is not as good as the 60s-70s short films, &apos;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&apos;, the series &apos;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&apos; and a few of the films that came after, but is really lovely in its own way with plenty for children and adults like. \n\n&apos;Christopher Robin&apos; is not perfect as has been said. It does drag and loses its warmth and charm with the family and workplace scenes of the first half, which came over as over-sentimental and dreary, with few surprises having been done numerous times in the same way. A shame when the opening scene was so charming and sweet, and relatable for any child growing up. Anybody expecting a lot of depth shouldn&apos;t really, only Pooh and Christopher Robin, done beautifully on both counts, grow here really.\n\nMark Gatiss does overdo his weasel-like (or should we say woozle-like) character for my liking, an unsubtle stereotype and played with even less subtlety that it gets annoying. Would have liked more of some of the Hundred Acre Wood characters, half underused especially Owl and Kanga. \n\nHad no problem with most of the voice work, but always did find Peter Capaldi to be an odd choice for Rabbit (under-characterised here) and still do, basically it&apos;s Doctor Who with a London-ish accent and it doesn&apos;t fit Rabbit. \n\nHowever, the opening scene is full of the childhood innocence, warmth and charm one expects from Winnie the Pooh and those qualities do pick up once Pooh re-appears and even more so when the other Hundred Acre Wood characters are re-introduced. Much of &apos;Christopher Robin&apos; is full of nostalgia and there are some lovely gently humorous touches, especially with Tigger and even more so Eeyore who has some of the best lines. There is a melancholy and wistfulness that is both appealing and moving, Pooh does bring tears to the eyes and his interplay, one of the film&apos;s biggest strengths, with Christopher is sweet and humorous.\n\nPresent also are nice glimpses of the original drawings and the nostalgia is created mainly by the numerous references to the stories and the previous Winnie the Pooh incarnations (the exchange between Christopher and Pooh concluding the opening scene, getting lost, Heffalumps and Woozles, the balloon, a couple of the songs from the 1960s-1970s short films to name a few). The Hundred Acre Wood characters are not far off from their original personalities, particularly Eeyore and Tigger, the only reservation being Rabbit and perhaps Piglet could have been a little more timid. \n\nThroughout &apos;Christopher Robin&apos; looks lovely, with handsome period detail, photography that is a mix of purposefully grim to idyllic and a beautifully rendered and quite faithful Hundred Acre Wood. The effects for Pooh and co. are delightful and looks great, maybe not quite how Disney portrayed them visually but not far off from the original drawings of the stories, of which the spirit is captured beautifully once in the Hundred Acre Wood, and their conditions of being forgotten for so long obvious in a realistic fashion. The eyes are not quite expressive, though not creepy, but the characterisations and how they interact and move are certainly expressive. The music is whimsical and melancholic, while the story falters with the family and workplace scenes early on but is charming, warm-hearted and poignant everywhere else. The script is thoughtful and affectionate and Marc Forster, perfect for the job and bringing the same qualities he did for &apos;Finding Neverland&apos;, directs sympathetically.\n\nEwan McGregor does a great job here, a hard role to balance quite a number of emotions and reacting against nothing for much of the film but it is a nuanced performance, stern and uptight at first but mellows into childlike wonder. Basically it is a great portrayal of forgetting fond memories and finding them again, learning things along the way, with a few nice life lessons, that allows the character to grow, apparent in the heart-warming ending. Hayley Atwell is a rootable presence and Bronte Carmichael is a star in the making. Making more of an impression is the voice acting. Brad Garrett is a standout as Eeyore, sadness at its funniest. Nick Mohammed doesn&apos;t quite match the giant shoes left by John Fiedler, having voiced Piglet from the very beginning until his death in 2005, but the sweetness and timidity is captured nicely. Best of all is Jim Cummings, he&apos;s been voicing Pooh and Tigger since the late 80s and the experience shows. He has not lost Tigger&apos;s humour and liveliness but it&apos;s as Pooh where he is particularly wonderful, having not moved me to tears this much until now.\n\nOverall, very nicely done and definitely well worth watching once it gets going. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

It doesn&apos;t have any roll on the floor laughs but then again it doesn&apos;t try to. Made before the blockbuster era of Jaws and Star Wars and even before the crass but extremely funny humor of M.A.S.H., simple movies like this could be made for a modest cost without being expected to be the next Gone With The Wind.\n\nIf you come across this movie, just enjoy it without looking for any deep underlying message.",

      "reviewBody": "Inspired by Love Actually and that genre of storytelling, &quot;Life in a Metro&quot; is a sometimes insightful and sometimes predictable movie that is well worth a watch for its performances. The narrative featuring Kay Kay and Shilpa Shetty is genuine with many insightful comments -Shilpa Shetty&apos;s about the &quot;deafening silences in marriages&quot;, the interesting question of which between physical or emotional infidelity is worse. Kay Kay&apos;s character of being a loving father who is adored by his daughter was a further dose of realism. Nothing is black and white. Special mention to both Kay Kay and Shilpa Shetty (didn&apos;t realise she had it in her) for really pulling it off. Shiny Ahuja is adequate without being special.\n\nThe other narratives were more predictable. Sharman Joshi and Kangana Raut - which is sort of a take off from &quot;The Apartment&quot; with Jack Lemmon and &quot;For Love or Money&quot; with Michael J Fox. So were Dharmendra and Nafisa Ali as the loving elder couple.\n\nThe track with Konkona Sen and Irfan is very entertaining. Irfan Khan is outstanding - an adjective one has started to use very often with him. Konkona adequate. However the circumstances make for some genuinely funny moments. Konkona as the 30 year old virgin dying to be with her idea man and Irfan - as about the most unlikely of men she could ever see herself with.\n\nWhile I would not go so far as to herald this movie as either a path-breaking or life-altering Hindi movie (as some of the more dramatic leanings have suggested), I would say it is well worth a watch. It has a good music track - but could have done without the really hairy guy singing, as we changed from one narrative to the other."

The film was simply wonderful from beginning to end--charming, emotionally satisfying, delicately nuanced and very powerful. The acting was sublime, as in all Jordan films. Cillian Murphy is so impossibly gorgeous and yet so fearless and skillful an actor, who uses his physicality to his supreme advantage. The Irish gang of three-Gleeson, Neeson and Rea, who usually appear in Jordan&apos;s films, were superb and touching as usual. There were wonderful casting touches--Bryan Ferry as a sicko, Gaivn Friday as a gay rockabilly, etc. The film was audacious, swerving mightily between broad comedy and grim tragedy. The most arresting elements were the amazing customes and the choice of 60s and 70s songs, something Jordan discussed in detail during the Q&amp;A.\n\nI urge all cineastes to catch this one-you will be amazed and deeply satisfied.",

It&apos;s almost like they had a great setup and didn&apos;t know how to explain things or end them.\n\nAs others mentioned, the film is enveloped in fog and is quite grainy. Switzerland was never that foggy when I was there! And the music didn&apos;t really match the action on the film.\n\nAll in all, from what I can tell, skip this and try the book.",

      "name": "A heavy-handed sympathy piece (Part 1 of 3)",
      "reviewBody": "This was inspired by the real life case of Armin Meiwes who put an ad over an Internet site looking for a willing victim to be slaughtered and their flesh consumed. What made the case so unusual was he was not only serious but another man named Bernd Jurgen Brandes obliged apparently without being physically forced as a share of the event was captured on videotape. &quot;Grimm Love&quot; is a tale that paces as a dark narrative drama with a fictional college student named Katie Armstrong, played by Keri Russell, returning to where these two lived in Germany in an attempt to get inside their heads for a research paper.\n\nInstead of concentrating on horror and shock, the filmmakers switch back and forth between the present with Ms. Armstrong and also in the past with the two men who eventually meet up in a kind of twisted, interconnected fate. Oliver (based on Meiwes) is shown as far back as adolescence with his father leaving, trouble fitting in at school, as well as having no life apart from taking care of his ailing mother. He&apos;s alone and looking for companionship, though his way of connecting with people isn&apos;t hugs, kisses or long conversations, but instead a longing fixation of consuming the flesh of someone special to feel stimulation and closeness.\n\nSimon (based on Brandes) is a homosexual who fears showing his feelings in public out of misunderstandings and ridicule. He has severe depression and searches for a sense of belonging through some normal and not so normal ways. He looks at extreme fetishes on an Internet chatroom as a way of feeling alive from a life that never accepted him. In 2003, Gay Chinese actor/composer Leslie Cheung was successful but still committed suicide by jumping off a building, likewise Simon also has things going for him, though it&apos;s too much and he wants to meet his end with symbolism that directly &quot;severs&quot; ties with his burdensome sexuality that gives him a guilt complex from his mother&apos;s suicide at an early age.\n\nDodging the pulse-pounding route of &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; this comes across more like &quot;Kalifornia&quot; by hearing the thoughts and experiences as they come through with narration. It also flows as slow as Cronenberg&apos;s &quot;Spider&quot; in an attempt at an on-the-surface character study of these atypical individuals&apos; thought processes and motivations. Though the college student&apos;s montages about how these two men affect her take up extra screen time away from finding out more. There are metaphors and poetic wordings interspliced to sway the audience towards deep sympathy for these two fractured individuals. Sometimes making you think with introspection, but at other times being desperate to make a point and forcing their way in, like some of Keri Russells&apos; obvious voice overs instead of letting the camera do the talking.\n\n&quot;Grimm Love&quot; isn&apos;t going to be like watching a biopic on the History Channel by just stating the events as is, as the filmmakers are doing select reporting to be more convincing towards a certain compassionate, sentimental way of thinking than letting your own thoughts flow free. To some it&apos;s going to be touching, to others it&apos;s going to be sympathy for the devil. The heavy leaning towards the first here can take away from the experience as it feels written with a prior agenda in mind, not to mention before all things were considered in the case as the real events took place in only 2001 and an overturned verdict came in 2006 when this came out. I like the angle of diving into their background even if it breaks psychology down for the layman, though this would have worked better as a biography with anecdotes from relatives, friends and experts. Or if a story is to be had, something like the route taken with &quot;Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,&quot; where the director of that film said he feels that he shouldn&apos;t have to decide a stance for the viewer, that that&apos;s up to them.\n\nThis isn&apos;t an exploitation film that takes advantage of real events such as &quot;Men Behind the Sun&quot; did, as it&apos;s more suggestive than showing candid nudity and bodily infliction like &quot;Cannibal&quot; about the same events. Though by the time it closes--right after the infamous scenario between the men that&apos;s akin to the real life events in &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot;--it can&apos;t seem to decide what it wanted to be. In the beginning and middle it was going out of its way to reason with the audience that these guys aren&apos;t just a couple of kooks with mental issues like the media sensationalized. Though by its close they left the story up in the air and ambiguous with the young woman being either deeply moved or having a change of heart. It makes me believe she was only included as a ploy for the writers to speak through her and then at the end decided it was time enough to let the audience choose. Not to mention at an inopportune time as it ends abruptly and doesn&apos;t show what happened next. (See my profile and click chronological for the second review of &quot;Cannibal&quot; or the third review &quot;Downloading Nancy.&quot;) (Also submitted on http://fromblacktoredfilmreviews.blogspot.com/)",

      "reviewBody": "In the beautiful British town of Stratford-Upon-Avon there&apos;s a street where the owners of two neighbouring houses have no idea of the rich lives being led in their backyards. In these backyards there are two groups of garden gnomes - one garden is ruled by the blue hatted variety, the other is ruled by the red hatted variety. An age old feud - of which the reason has long since been forgotten - is keeping them apart, but unexpected events might just be enough to get them back together again.\n\nLoosely based on the Shakespearean tragedy Romeo And Juliet this animation film keeps the middle line between tragicomedy and romance. Like many animation films being made these last years it combines fun things for kids with fun things for adults - without hurting either group (the innuendo that is fun for adults is not seen by kids whose innocence protects them from it, the deviation from the original tales to make it fun for kids is not so warped that it makes it unrecognisable for them parents).\n\nThe animation is great - the gnomes and the gardens are just lovely to watch. The setting with gnomes is flawless - the sounds, the implications of being a garden gnome - it works out really well.\n\nIf there would be one bit of negativity for this film it is that its trailer is a bit too biased towards an audience that wants to see romance instead of a bit of light comedy.\n\n8 out of 10 midsummer night&apos;s dreams",

I could relate better with Juliane&apos;s approach to women&apos;s right conviction, but something tells me that perhaps to achieve greater advances Marianne&apos;s fire for the cause is what is needed at times. For me, Marianne&apos;s conviction as an adult, and cheeky behavior as a young woman was enticing and contagious, but Juliane&apos;s gentle soul was lovely and engaging, the cause for her is built from woman to woman, with sorority at the center, supporting each other, establishing strong bonds, and for that same reason I think her role is even a little more hopeful.",

It&apos;s another film, however, in which there is a strong anti-U.S. military flavor, so typical in films since the 1960s. \n\nAlso, once you know the ending, I doubt if this would be a movie you would watch more than once.

From collecting books to figurines, dinosaurs were just the most entertaining and fascinating creatures, and I was obviously excited when I saw this documentary on TV - one of my first times seeing live-looking dinosaurs in action.\n\nThough this documentary shows clips from a variety of classic dinosaur films, there were also some original dinosaur footage filmed especially for this movie - most notably the battle between the Tyrannosaurus Rex and Monoclonius, the Trachodon escaping the T-Rex and the pair of Deinonychus chasing down a Struthiomimus. These scenes were definitely the highlight of the documentary and it was a treat for me seeing these live-looking dinosaurs in battle.\n\nA very good documentary with some good insight in the narration and, though dated by 2010s standard, good visual effects for its time.\n\nGrade A-",

The direction and cinematography were excellent. The lead boy was only 12 when the film was shot, yet he delivers a mature, sensitive and deeply emotional performance.\n\nThe film is long but very compelling and speaks loudly about man&apos;s inhumanity to his fellow man. The message is even more disturbing when told through the eyes of a young teenager who is caught up in the atrocities of the Nazis and their Hungarian allies.\n\nIf this film were in English or directed by Steven Spielberg, it would no doubt win numerous awards. Let us hope that &quot;Fateless&quot; is recognized for it&apos;s bravery and excellence.",

      "reviewBody": "Any film directed by F.W. Murnau merits serious attention, but &quot;The Grand Duke&apos;s Finances&quot; is especially noteworthy because it&apos;s one of Murnau&apos;s rare attempts at comedy. Based on this one film (the only Murnau comedy I&apos;ve seen to date), Murnau&apos;s comedic skills were far less developed than his flair for drama and melodrama. However, there are some good points throughout this film.\n\nThe plot is not especially credible nor especially funny, and each chapter of the story is prefaced with an introductory title which (except for the climactic one) features a long, long description of who these people are and what they mean to accomplish.\n\nThe best performance in the film is given by Alfred Abel. I&apos;ve seen Abel in a few other comedies, and I usually find him stolid and stiff. Here, surprisingly, he&apos;s quite funny as a wealthy eccentric who resorts to various scams and false identities to enrich himself even more. Wearing long sideburns and an unusual makeup, in this film Abel looks remarkably like Eddie Foy Junior! Abel also gets the funniest dialogue in the film, courtesy of the silent intertitles. When beautiful Mady Christians wants to evade her pursuers, Abel deftly makes her look extremely unattractive and then he remarks: &quot;This is how I expect my wife to look.&quot; When she faints at Abel&apos;s table in a bistro, he suavely asks the waiter for a glass of cognac, apparently to revive her ... and then Abel drinks it himself. I anticipated as much, but then Abel uses the cognac&apos;s lingering fumes to revive her.\n\nAlthough long stretches of this comedy are unfunny, nevertheless &quot;The Grand Duke&apos;s Finances&quot; contains the earliest example I&apos;ve ever encountered of a perennial sight gag that I call &quot;the punctuated stampede&quot;. We&apos;ve all seen this gag in dozens of cartoons: a mob of figures rush across the screen, followed by a pause, and then one last little straggler brings up the rear. In this film, for no discernible reason, a top-hatted Abel contrives to send a pack of wolfhounds racing through his own mansion ... with a little dachshund bringing up the rear to punctuate the stampede.\n\nIn the central role of Don Ramon the Twenty-Second, Grand Duke of the Mediterranean nation of Abacco, Harry Liedtke is only vaguely amusing. Fans of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; will be intrigued to see Max Schreck&apos;s name in the cast list here. Schreck plays one of a quartet of political agitators. He wears a long straggly beard and looks impressively gaunt but has almost nothing to do, except for one amusing bit of physical business when a maidservant chases him out of the Grand Duke&apos;s castle. A far more impressive (and much more physical) performance is given by Hans Schaufuss as Schreck&apos;s hunchbacked co-conspirator. Schaufuss leaps, capers, goggles at the camera, swings from a rope, and gives a performance even more athletic than Lon Chaney&apos;s Quasimodo.\n\nThe exterior photography is excellent, and I felt a nostalgic twinge during a shot of a tram moving through a city&apos;s streets at night. Several sequences were shot on shipboard, and I was pleased to see the horizon heaving up and down realistically, unlike in so many Hollywood films which feature stationary cameras in &quot;shipboard&quot; sequences. Near the end, there&apos;s a funny shot of a woman chasing a man into the distance ... but Leo McCarey would have done it better. Murnau was a great director of dramas, but his comedic efforts fall very far short of Ernst Lubitsch&apos;s comedies. I&apos;ll rate &quot;The Grand Duke&apos;s Finances&quot; 6 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "I think the director here actually did a much better job of letting Trish Stratus come across as herself than any of the WWF etcetera shows I&apos;ve seen her in, and that definitely made it worth watching. (Of course, it was arguably/technically the Director&apos;s job to make her seem like a Bounty Hunter and not herself, but that&apos;s another story entirely...)\n\nLong story, but I was fortunate enough to spend about about maybe an hour hanging out with and talking-one-on-one with Trish Stratus after she was hired by the WWF but before she actually started working with them. (Plus some time watching her interact with others.) She was definitely &quot;my type&quot; so I&apos;ll never forget that chance to get know her.\n\nWatching this movie, well, the script is bad, there was a plot hole could taxi a 757 Jumbo Jet through, but in addition to watching one of Trish&apos;s partners do really funny routines (which is worth watching) we get to see Trish do some of her &quot;MMA&quot; stuff.\n\nWhat I really liked about the movie though, and this is a bit hard to explain, is it looked and seemed like Trish. The actress, the weight-lifter and the athlete who has to do all those &quot;MMA&quot; moves on WWF and the like.\n\nAgain, it&apos;s hard to explain, but it just seem like the women I had talked to so long ago. Right there on my screen, doing MMA and reading out her lines in a B movie plot.\n\nOk... I take back the &quot;hard to explain part&quot; because I just figured it out... I think what I like is that the director of this film did a much better job of bringing out some of Trish&apos;s beyond-just-her-awesome-looks endearing qualities better than anyone directing any of the many wrestling show&apos;s I&apos;ve seen her in. And now that I&apos;ve figure that out, I&apos;m going to copy that to the top of this review, and submit it to IMDB.\n\nSeriously, she&apos;s really a great person to get know if for some whatever reason you ever get a chance to.\n\nOh... btw... there&apos;s a photoshoot video of Trish in &quot;Divas: Postcard from the Caribbean&quot;.... worth checking out. To be 100% honest, I expected it to filled with B. S. made-up dialog about the girls, but even though they added some &quot;spin&quot; to Trish&apos;s background, there wasn&apos;t a single word there that contradicted anything she had told me about herself. :-)",

      "reviewBody": "Ever since The Golden Turkey Awards chose Ed Wood as the world&apos;s worst director back in the 80s there have been a lot of people who automatically dismiss all Ed Wood movies as garbage. Even Tim Burton&apos;s terrific &apos;Ed Wood&apos; has encouraged this. My opinion is that there are many, many worse directors out there, because at least Wood&apos;s movies were fun and entertaining, unlike many of those made by the likes of  Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay, directors who are able to work with budgets a 1000 times bigger than Wood I might add! &apos;Bride Of The Monster&apos; is one of Wood&apos;s most underrated movies. It was his second movie to star horror legend Bela Lugosi, but unlike the first, the truly mind blowing &apos;Glen Or Glenda&apos;, it isn&apos;t completely inept. True, some of the acting is terrible, especially the talentless leading lady Loretta King who is (I admit it) lousy, and Wood regular Paul Marco, who has a small supporting role as a cop. But, and this is a BIG but, Lugosi is terrific. Many fans regard this as his best performance. I wouldn&apos;t go that far but it&apos;s hard not to get choked up at Lugosi&apos;s immortal &quot;I have no home&quot; speech. &apos;Bride Of The Monster&apos; is the first Wood film to feature the amazing Tor Johnson. He plays Lugosi&apos;s Tibetan servant/slave Lobo. All the scenes with Lobo are great fun to watch, especially when Lugosi whips him. Apart from Lugosi and Tor this movie is best remembered for the rubber octopus monster. Of course it&apos;s a hoot, but the rest of the picture isn&apos;t anywhere near as bad as many claim and is comparable to say &apos;The Devil Bat&apos;, which Lugosi starred in back in the 1940s. Both movies suffer from their minuscule budgets, but both are still worth watching to see Lugosi struggle for greatness. I recommend &apos;Bride Of The Monster&apos; to all horror fans, especially those of Bela Lugosi."

I give it a grade between C+ and B- and I will add it to my dvd collection. give it a try. it&apos;s worth at least one look.",

When I mean funny, I don&apos;t mean it in the term of the general laugh-out-loud sense, but more in the reins of a &quot;smart&quot; funny. What I&apos;m trying to say is don&apos;t expect much slapstick from this film despite being labeled as a comedy. That being said, this film is your typical 80&apos;s drama/comedy and is reasonably entertaining. It has good acting, good writing, and a good script. However, the movie felt just a tad long despite it being under two hours.\n\nThis film, which is directed by Barry Levinson, is about two tin men who are both aluminum-panel sellers. After a fender-bender, these two men becomes ultimate rivals and do anything to create havoc with each other.\n\nThis film is well-acted thanks to the strong leads by Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss. They have good chemistry between each other and each shows off their comedic chops. Personally, I felt the film is at it&apos;s best when we see problem after problem occurring to DeVito&apos;s character, whose life goes sharply downhill over the course of the film.\n\nOverall, Tin Men is a solid film that talks about what happens when fate pit two rivals against each other. The back and forth between these two men are enlightening and often entertaining to watch. Not the best film on Levinson&apos;s resume, but it&apos;s still a solid, smart film. I rate this film 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "Turistas (2006) is a movie I saw an advance screening of ages ago and recently watched again on Tubi. The storyline follows a group of tourists in Brazil whose tour bus breaks down and they decide to continue their trip on foot. As they get off the beaten path they find more fun than they could ever imagine but then wake up the next day to their worst nightmare.\n\nThis movie is directed by John Stockwell (Dark Tide) and stars Josh Duhamel (Transformers), Melissa George (Hunted), Olivia Wilde (Tron: Legacy), Desmond Askew (Go), Max Brown (The Tudors) and Beau Garrett (Tron: Legacy).\n\nThe settings and circumstances are well established in this and the cast is pretty solid. The storyline is cliche and straightforward but still fun to watch unfold. There&apos;s also some comedy mixed in here and there, the prostitution scene always cracks me up. I did like how they did the drug scenes and the kill sequences and gore are very solid. There&apos;s a machete scene in this I always love. There&apos;s a good use of a staple gun in this as well; and to be honest, there&apos;s some surgery scenes that make me woozy. The use of underwater scenes was a bit too much but the circumstances overall felt realistic.\n\nOverall this is a slightly above average horror movie with some good gore and kill scenes. This is definitely worth a viewing for horror enthusiasts that I would score a 5.5-6/10.",

The trio cast including Jean Arthur and Joel McCrea is stellar. This is a doting film that takes its time with details, yet is warmly effective. The chemistry between Arthur and McCrea is heart pounding (especially the side walk scene!) The magic shared between them permeates the screen. (There&apos;s something about McCrea that makes a girl want to fall into his lap.) Coburn&apos;s antics as the sly matchmaker are hilarious. &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; is cleverly written and humorously acted. For classic film lovers, this one&apos;s a gem."

However Mr Grimsdale and Pitkin accidentally get on the wrong truck and are parachuted behind enemy lines.  When Mr Grimsdale is captured by the Nazi&apos;s the resistance decide to use Pitkin&apos;s uncanny resemblance to Nazi General Schreiber to effect a rescue.\n\nIn stead of Norman Wisdom&apos;s usual plot of `working class lad showing up the rich&apos;, we have `working class lad showing up the military and the Nazis&apos;. Here the plot allows several funny set ups before eventually falling back on the old `lookalike&apos; chestnut.  However it&apos;s still quite funny  it&apos;s not Wisdom&apos;s best, but it has it&apos;s moments and happily there is very little of his usual `dreaming of unattainable girl&apos; stuff that he usually does.\n\nThe cast is better than usual.  Wisdom still has his innocent `salt of the earth&apos; thing going on and is funny and charming.  Chapman fits well with him as Grimsdale, although the two have had better films together.  A very young Honor Blackman (her voice hasn&apos;t changed a bit!) is good if fleeting and even Hattie Jacques turns up.  The army officers are filled out with familiar faces and everyone tries hard.\n\nOverall this isn&apos;t Wisdom&apos;s best  but the working class Council worker triumphs over the Germans and upperclasses as a whole  who can&apos;t get some enjoyment out of that?!"

      "reviewBody": "THE WEATHERING CONTINENT (1992) is a 55-minute animated feature that was shown in theaters in Japan on a triple bill with SILENT MOBIUS 2 and THE HEROIC LEGEND OF ARSLAN II. It has an odd mood for a sword-and-sorcery-style anime, being slow-moving and fairly quiet, with occasional bursts of activity, although little in the way of actual action. It&apos;s set in a post-apocalyptic desert landscape many centuries ago and involves a journey undertaken by three refugees: Lakshi, a young girl with a sword, who&apos;s disguised as a boy; Tieh, a pacifistic long-haired mystic with healing powers; and Boice, a muscular warrior. They spend their time dodging bandits while trying to find water, food and civilizationin that order. They stop at Azec Sistura, the underground &quot;city of the dead,&quot; and get mixed up in a conflict started when pursuing bandits arouse the anger of the spirits lying dormant there.\n\nI never quite understood what was going on or grasped any of the background of the main characters. Yet my interest was continually held by two things. First, the production design is quite spectacular throughout, particularly in the scenes taking place in the ornate city of the dead and its flashbacks to the era when the city teemed with life. Apparently, the people who lived there planned the underground city in order to keep their souls encased in a representation of the life they&apos;d lived, complete with masks for all the corpses. It&apos;s an intriguing concept and it&apos;s beautifully presented by the artwork, although I never quite understood its significance to the main characters.\n\nThe other notable aspect of the film is the music score by female composer Michiru Oshima, a varied collection of melodies, ranging from the lyrical to the ominous, and musical styles, including some nice jazz riffs, which underscore every scene and give the film a flavor and feeling that help us glide over the lack of a compelling narrative. I have the CD of the score and it&apos;s among my favorite anime soundtracks. Oshima also scored &quot;Legend of Crystania,&quot; &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist,&quot; and &quot;Boys Over Flowers,&quot; among others.\n\nThe character design is by Nobuteru Yuuki, who has dozens of prominent anime credits, including &quot;Five Star Stories,&quot; &quot;Record of Lodoss War,&quot; &quot;X: The Movie,&quot; and &quot;Escaflowne: The Movie.&quot; Director Koichi Mashimo also directed &quot;Ai City,&quot; &quot;Dirty Pair: Project Eden,&quot; &quot;Dominion Tank Police,&quot; &quot;The Irresponsible Captain Tylor,&quot; &quot;Sorcerer Hunters,&quot; and &quot;Noir,&quot; among other popular titles."

It does feel disappointing tho, cause they didn&apos;t really try too much, but rather relaid on more successful stories instead so all they had to do was go fishing.\n\nCan&apos;t believe I&apos;m saying this, but I am annoyed and a little mad, thus I think it is better if I don&apos;t recommend this little production right here. If you are not too familiar with the Asian Horror Cinema, Ring Of Curse might seem like a breath of fresh air, but if you are, you&apos;ll pick up the signs in no time.\n\nSo without spoiling it too much, I don&apos;t wanna influence your decision in no way whatsoever, this movie will get a 5 from me. Right in the middle, I&apos;ll let others tell you more about it. As mentioned before, it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Sorry to say so.\n\nCheers!",

I&apos;ve heard a lot of people compare this movie to Donnie Darko and I don&apos;t really get that. Although DD is a really good movie it&apos;s totally about two different things. I thought that Rory Culkin was underused and should have had at least one more scene in the movie. Billy (Justin Chatwin) who at first didn&apos;t seem really believable as the school bully(he seemed too pretty boy) ended growing on me and I actually started to have a strong dislike for the kid. Crystal (Camilla Belle) did a great job as well. Dean (Jamie Bell) has really gotten my interest too. He&apos;s a great actor and I look forward to whatever it is he does next. I highly recommend watching this movie and in fact have already told about 10 people about it.",

Its not so much what you see, its what you feel. Its the atmosphere that&apos;s strangling the air from you. Its the feeling of the walls closing in on you. Its psychology in a film that is a forgotten art. Is the main character in danger, or is he going insane? The level of uncertainty gives the audience no comfort in feeling any control. In a era of gore and nudity, this movie is a welcome breath of fresh air and shows that there are still directors out there who are willing to produce top quality Cinema to the horror movie goers.\n\nDefinitely a movie that needs to be more widely recognized.",

      "reviewBody": "A powerful witch and her acolytes practice black magic and perform human sacrifices. This being a Ted V. Mikel&apos;s movie, I knew to not get my hopes up too high, and sure enough, the titular &apos;blood orgy&apos;, which comes at the end of the film, fails to impress: rather than a room full of naked, entwined, blood-drenched Satanists caught in the throes of ecstasy, we get a half-dozen women in fur bikinis doing a bad Pan&apos;s People dance routine to a bongo beat. Furthermore, the trippy opening credits accompanied by weird experimental electronic music, which suggest a wild, psychedelic piece of surreal cinema is in store for the viewer, are totally misleading: Mikel&apos;s direction is about as vanilla as it gets. It&apos;s lame, but at the same time the film possesses a naive schlocky charm that might make it endearing to fans of low-budget z-grade movies. And that&apos;s this film in a nutshell: it ain&apos;t going to wow the socks off anyone, but it&apos;s good for a few giggles if you&apos;re in the right mood. The best part of the whole film is definitely the hilarious seance that sees witch Mara (Lila Zaborin) channelling the voices of the dead, including a native American who speaks in clichéd &apos;Tonto talk&apos;: it&apos;s heap load of hokey silliness - me findum funny. Mara also provides sporadic laughs with her oft-repeated catchphrase &apos;As I will, so mote it be!&apos; - you&apos;ll be saying it for weeks afterwards! A flashback to medieval times - clearly designed to cash in on the success of films like The Devils and Mark of the Devil - is clumsily handled by Mikels, his scenes of the burning and stoning of young women not nearly as nasty as those that inspired them. A rushed ending in which practitioners of white magic defeat Mara and her followers rounds off the film in unspectacular fashion.",

Paul Hoerbiger is excellent as an aged Lothario chasing &apos;Auntie Lottie&apos; around the roof, while the REAL auntie - played by Ruehmann&apos;s real-life wife, the astonishingly beautiful Herta Feiler - turns up to add to the mayhem, and smells a rat when she recognizes &apos;Auntie Lottie&apos;s dress as her own. Ruehmann&apos;s wonderfully camp mambo number is undoubtedly the highlight, but there&apos;s plenty of period charm on offer too."

Maybe if I&apos;d been born in the 50&apos;s or 60&apos;s, and grown up loving the original, then gotten all excited about a remake, only to have my hopes dashed by a mediocre product, I&apos;d loathe this like everyone else does. But I was born in &apos;76. By the time I got around to being able to actually comprehend movies, this was already on T.V. every Saturday afternoon. For me, there have always been two King Kongs. Yes, the black and white ape is more believable, and scarier looking, and more lovable, and inarguably the star of a better movie. But when you&apos;re 5 years old, a man in a monkey suit is just as realistic as a stop motion model, because suspension of disbelief is not just easy for you, it&apos;s a way of life. So go ahead, hate this movie if you want. To me, it&apos;s an old friend, and I won&apos;t abandon it.",

Totally unwanted and dreadful would-be comedy that uses up all its energy and possible assets early on with stupid situation after stupid situation. Even the performers seem like they know they are in a horrid movie that seems so much longer than it really is. As usual with films of the type, we have sitcom scenarios that are hard enough to make interesting over a half hour time slot let alone a cinematic feature which is three times as long. Break out the holy water and exorcise this celluloid. 2 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "The main purpose of the cinema is to entertain.Entertainment can mean different things to different people.Normally we expect a lot of emotion in Indian movies.If emotion makes you feel like throwing up, you should not really be watching Indian Hindi movies.If you are really taken with realism, watch a documentary. If you want to get away from the mundane affairs of everyday life watch a Hindi movie.Veer Zaara is a Hindi movie with lots of emotion. The audience identify with the characters and go back to watching it again and again.One must realise that a movie is a hit only when the audience is able to identify themselves with the characters.Questions do come to mind. Like, how did Rani Mukherjee know Veer&apos;s name? Maybe Yash Chopra made a mistake. The mistake did not cost him anything because the movie succeeded at the box-office.It might also have taken too long a time to give an explanation.And the movie is already 192 minutes long. A flaw nevertheless, but then you can find faults with just about everything. If you have negative vibes about the person playing the principal character in a movie, you really should not be watching the movie in the first place. SRK has become a living legend.He is a good actor. He has done well as the young squadron leader as well as the ageing prisoner. Twenty two years in jail can age a man beyond his years. Shahrukh was convincing.Preity was her usual bubbly self initially, and then equally convincing.The movie was fast paced.Editing was good. No where did it drag.The songs were excellent."

Everything from the acting to the directing was brilliant and the scenery was breathtaking.\n\nAnthony Hopkins gave another knockout performance as Colonel Ludlow and Brad Pitt was brilliant as Tristan.Aidan Quinn, Henry Thomas and Julia Ormond were perfectly cast as Alfred, Samuel and Susanna.\n\nThe one thing I liked most about this movie was the ending - which I won&apos;t spoil. It is rare when watching a movie, you cannot pick the ending. The ending to this movie was so amazing, and the fact that it wasn&apos;t obvious what was going to happen made this movie more enjoyable.\n\nJames Horner is a master. Just like he did with Titanic, the score for Legends of the Fall took the movie to another level."

      "reviewBody": "Hunchback of the Morgue (1972) \n\n** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nA deformed hunchback (Paul Naschy) is picked on by everyone except for a beautiful woman. When that woman dies the hunchback goes to a scientist in hopes that he can bring her back to life. The doctor says he can but in return he wants the hunchback to do some killing for him. \n\nLoosely based on Poe&apos;s Murders in the Rue Morgue, the film also mixes in elements of Frankenstein and the end result is a rather entertaining movie that works on several levels but the biggest is the fact that the movie is just downright nasty at times and it takes pleasure in it. HUNCHBACK OF THE MORGUE offers Naschy a tasty role and he really delivers.\n\nThe film works best as long as you don&apos;t take it too serious or go into it expecting some sort of art film. I mean, the movie is pretty sleazy throughout but things get really crazy during the second half when we get all sorts of strange violence from body parts being cut off to guts pour out and there are even rats eating faces. All of the gore is handled quite well and the overall sleazy nature of it perfect fits the atmosphere of the movie as well as the beautiful set design.\n\nAs far as Naschy goes, he got to play just about every monster possible and this here was certainly his most sympathetic role, which is shocking when you consider that this character is a murderer. I thought the actor did a very good job in the role and the sympathetic nature was a major plus. The supporting cast are all fine as well but there&apos;s no question that the picture belongs to Naschy."

Possibly the most politically incorrect giallo I&apos;ve seen, the film is a real treat for fans of spaghetti horror.\n\nThe film is a visual feast and has a great score by Bruno Nicolai. It is rich in atmosphere and &apos;70s spirit.\n\nThe cast are excellent - Antonio De Teffè is outstanding as the &quot;nuttier than a bottle of chips&quot; Lord Alan Cunningham. There is a bevy of beauties in this movie (which always helps the proceedings), notably Marina Malfatti as Gladys Cunningham.\n\nThere are some genuine surprises in this film, I thoroughly enjoyed it. A solid 7 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "I would say that this movie rivals the skill of the first &quot;Next Generation&quot; movie, First Contact. If anything, the dialogue is more refined and the humour, of which there is a great deal, is well timed and raised smiles at suitable points in the movie. Many have criticised the writers for either making the humour too silly or, for not daring to take the jokes to the belly-laugh level. Personally, I think the film is richer for the homour, which seems natural, not forced, and generally hit its targets. After all though, it&apos;s not a comedy.\n\nInsurrection is a movie which displays far more humanity than the cold, but nevertheless enthralling, First Contact. To compare the movies is difficult, as they are very different, and opinions will inevitably clash. Both movies have a different agenda, I think.\n\nI would dare to say that Insurrection would do a better job at converting people to the Star Trek &quot;cause&quot; than would any of the other films. Before watching, I knew little about Star Trek, and it really stoked my interest in the series. In evaluating Insurrection I realised that the film has several outstanding set-pieces, some of which are very memorable, such as the high-speed chase between Picard and Data through the cloud layers, with The Captain trying to coax Data into performing a scene from Gilbert and Sullivan&apos;s HMS Pinafore. The scene is outrageous, and very surreal, and extremely well done. Another example would be the attack of the flying miniature transporter robots, where Worf really gets to prove how brave, and violent, he really is.\n\nFinally, the acting is universally good, and Stewart puts in a performance of depth, although not as impressive as in First Contact. The plot of Insurrection is slight, and alone doesn&apos;t manage to hold the attention. But the other elements that go into producing a good movie, such as the script, acting, directing, and, dare I say it, special effects, add up to an entertaining whole.\n\nI think that free of the limitations imposed by the &quot;classic trek&quot; rules, and the campy acting that dogged the earlier Trek flicks, the Star Trek franchise will flourish, and this movie shows how much a cast enjoying what they are doing adds to the fun and feel-good factor of watching the film with a cinema full of enthralled viewers. Well done Jonathan Frakes!"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;We All Loved Each Other So Much&quot; is one of those classics referenced here and there (though not so frequently) as a spectacular masterpiece, an almost unknown treasure to be sought and seen. After years looking for it I can finally say those opinions are right. But the movie deserves more. A heavy airplay on cable or even regular TV, a Criterion Collection treatment or a bigger studio making a massive home video release instead of cult cine-clubs who exhibit it from time to time. This movie is on the same league as &quot;Amarcord&quot;, &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; and &quot;Splendor&quot; (1989) . The latter, like this one, is also directed by Ettore Scola and could be included as part of an informal Scola trilogy about nostalgia, that should be completed with &quot;Le Bal&quot; (1983). The themes and presentation of such are beautifully told, almost like a trademark that Italian and French cinema use frequently and always getting positive results that American cinema only dreams of reaching. The mark achieved here is to show the importance of memory, how time changes it, and the way things and events mold our essence, our friendships, our loves, our interests and each person&apos;s definition of happiness. And most important of all: how movies are a great part of all those things.\n\nThis is about three friends who served on the Italian resistance fighting against the Nazists and how their lives changed of direction during a course of 30 years. Mostly is about their similarities (at one point they all fell in love with the same woman) and the problems and events brought on them, with meetings and mismatches along the way. They are: Antonio (Nino Manfredi), a dedicated nurse whose career just stalled because of his political views, contrary to the current norm; the lawyer Gianni (Vittorio Gassman) an impeccable professional at the city hall who ends up corrupted by a powerful industrialist; and Nicola (Stefano Satta Flores), a movie buff who later becomes a film critic leaving family and kid behind after defending the greatness of &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; when the movie club he was part of accused De Sica&apos;s masterpiece of giving Italy a bad fame to the world. \n\nThe space is short, and I can&apos;t talk about all the characters but I must focus on my favorite, and the one I believe most of us will strongly identify with: the film addict, vigorously played by Satta Flores. Admit it, we are like him. Not in the wider sense of being extreme like he was but close. But I think we could lose friendships over our film ideals, defended to the death; we all like to believe we know everything about the subject and we really feel sorry for him when he loses the TV quiz about Italian cinema with a problematic misinterpreted question (he was right on the issue but the proposition was more simple than his answer). And if possible we would talk hours and hours and with the same verve and passion displayed by him. In an unforgettable moment, he recreates the Odessa stair sequence from &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; just to amuse a girl - and he succeeds it a bit! And that&apos;s what this movie is about: the power of movies and its importance in one&apos;s life. Nicola, like Antonio is known for his labor, don&apos;t get paid well and is far gone from his idealistic days after the war but he&apos;s deeply involved with what he does. A little cynic but happy which is the complete opposite of the more distanced friend, Gianni - but that&apos;s a story for you to discover by watching it. \n\nScola&apos;s nostalgic look for the past is embraceable, real, colorful but not that much, revealing the essence of who we truly are, people who think to have control over everything in our lives and we don&apos;t. At times engaging, lovely, other times saddening and so hard to not include events of your life and compare it with what the characters go through. Time comes and goes, our needs change, our concept of life and happiness go the same way as well or don&apos;t, we can disagree on politics and movies but there&apos;s friendship, love, admiration. And we are deeply connected by experiences, the best ones and the worst ones. I think if the trio had to select a moment to remember it would be their final battle during the war, in those snowy mountains. They would never have that same bond again. My favorite bit involving one of them was when the nurse got stopped by a film crew making &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;. The magic of it? Fellini and Mastroianni are there to play themselves recreating the famous Fontana de Trevi sequence, fourteen years later. Unforgettable. You won&apos;t be the same after watching this. 10/10",

His terrible script is hampered by dreadful dialogue (not helped by a wooden cast) and his handling of many scenes, most notably the action, leaves much be desired, being unimaginatively executed and ultimately rather lifeless.\n\nDespite all of this, however, the film still manages to be a reasonably entertaining experience—partly due to the silliness of the whole thing, partly because of the often excellent production design (much of which would not look out of place in a major Hollywood film) and some surprising violence, but mostly thanks to all of the S&amp;M-laced nudity, especially from the lovely Kitaen, who can&apos;t act, but who has a great bod and isn&apos;t afraid to show it.",

It&apos;s OK if u watch epics for the sets and costumes but beware the overripe dialogue and tedious but efficient direction of Richard Thorpe. Thorpe&apos;s main claim to fame was he was replaced as director on the Wizard of Oz for lack of originality. He also helmed a lot of Esther Williams&apos; swim pics. She dismissed him as a studio hack and tried unsuccessfully to have him replaced. Still,Lana looks great,manages to infuse what life she could into the proceedings,"

      "reviewBody": "This installment of The Three Mesquiteers stars Robert Livingston, Dusty King and Max Terhune. I mention who stars in the film because the composition of this Republic Studios trio varied tremendously over the years....with many different actors being cast to play the three roles. Perhaps because of this, King and Terhune left Republic after a few more films and went on to Monogram where they made a nearly identical series called The Range Busters. The trio in this series was much more stable, though after about 2/3 of the films, a few cast changes occurred.\n\nIn &quot;Hit the Saddle&quot; there are two main plots. First, Stony is in love with Rita (Rita Hayworth), a saloon girl with a heart of lead. His pals are dead set against this, as they understand exactly who Rita really is. The second is about a greedy rancher who not only wants his own horses but wants to capture the protected wild horses as well. The scum-bag needs to make these wild animals look dangerous, so he and his men deliberately stampede the horses...killing the sheriff in the process! Will Stony see the light and will the trio manage to bring the horse wranglers to justice?\n\nSo is it any good? Well, since Terhune does have his stupid ventriloquist dummy, Elmer, in the film...something I simply never understood about the Mesquiteer and Range Buster films. Why is a lawman and cowboy running around with a dummy like this?! What I also didn&apos;t love was how much Stony hated his friends....as they argued throughout the story....something you DON&apos;T expect in a Mesquiteer film! The men always play close friends....and disrupting this formula seemed foolish. Because of this, it&apos;s definitely not one of the team&apos;s better efforts.\n\n By the way, just before the killer stampede is loosed, pay attention as one of the baddies called the trio &apos;The Three Musketeers&apos;! I am surprised no one caught that and corrected it. It is possible they noticed but didn&apos;t both re-shooting it, as these B-westerns were definitely done on the cheap...and re-shoots cost money.",

So Eddie Murphy delivers his second Amazon Movie and his first Christmas themed movie and as a huge Fan of his I can say I&apos;m absolutely disappointed.\n\nThe movie starts of promising and seems to build up to original ideas, but only goes downhill as soon as the story starts to evolve. Sadly it&apos;s a absolute mess and they tried to cram so much into the movie that it&apos;s hard to keep track sometimes. The movie lacks depth and characters fight just to reconcile 1 minute later. The movie jumps from scene to scene and every moment of depth conflict or drama is resolved within a max of 3 minutes. There&apos;s not one scene that really made me laugh and the movie is so exhausting at times that i really struggled not to turn it off. I don&apos;t know what Eddie was thinking but this feels soulless and you can see it on the actors faces and their energy. Everyone seems bored, the dialogue&apos;s are hideous and nothing clicks... this is really disappointing and falls in the category of the Eddie Murphy movies that will be forgotten sooner than later.",

      "reviewBody": "Song and Tang are two conmen who make their money through murder and deception.  They live among the unemployed drifters of China, latch onto lonely young men, convince them to pretend to be one of their relatives and then the three get a job together in a mine.  After a few days, Song and Tang kill their companion and make it look like a cave in - extorting the bosses for compensation in return for silence.  They have been doing this for a while to good profit and plan to continue when they pick up the sixteen year old Yuan, creating a moral crisis for Song.\n\nI was not sure what this film was about when I sat to watch it but the fact that it had been made as an underground film (literally) without the permission of the Government and that was enough reason for me to give it a bit of my time.  As one would expect from such a film, the plot is a mix of narrative and comment.  The comment is delivered in the form of us seeing the working conditions and the poverty `enjoyed&apos; by the citizens who are outside of what we would consider the `proper&apos; economic system.  In this regard the film is interesting if not totally gripping.  The narrative is just as gripping but it is less satisfying as it seems to be secondary to the other aspects of the film.  The characters do just enough to carry the story along, in fact they win over the audience well enough for us to care about all the main players - essential in a film that is driven more by them than by action.\n\nTo that end, the cast (a mix of professionals and non-professionals) deliver the goods pretty well.  Yuan&apos;s innocence and dedication to the characters is key to the film and Wang carries this off well.  The elder Wang is also good but has a simpler character to deliver - however it is to his credit that his `bad&apos; guy never lost my interest.  Li is the best thing in the film even if he goes through an fairly recognisable crisis of confidence.  Yang Li&apos;s documentary background shows through with the realistic direction and the great use of locations - all the more impressive as many of them must have been difficult to shoot in.\n\nHowever, the lack of events means that the narrative is a little less than satisfying when it comes to the end.  We more or less know where it is going and the film uses the ending as much as a closure to the narrative as it is a further comment of the people&apos;s place within the system.  Despite this it is still worth seeing even if it may not match the hype that the awards and reviews on this page would have you believe.  Overall a good film that is worthy with good direction and acting even if the commentary of society and narrative don&apos;t sit as well together as one would hope."

      "reviewBody": "Do you have sneaking suspicions that all is not well in the food chain?\n\n— Are you puzzled and even disturbed when you see so much malnutrition and famine worldwide? And yet, when you look behind the headlines, you find evidence gathered by international agriculture experts that the planet has more than enough resources to feed everyone, if only we modify a few of our practices.\n\n— Do you keep hearing rumors that agribusiness farming practices have, in a matter of a few decades, been destroying topsoil that took centuries to build up? And that not only are they rendering farmland sterile in the absence of petroleum-based fertilizers and pesticides, but that they&apos;re also profiting handsomely from it?\n\n— Are you well enough informed to recognize that the Earth has reached peak oil production? And that, from here on out, the petroleum on which today&apos;s societies have based their transportation, prosperity, and general well-being will be scarcer and scarcer, and more and more unaffordable, especially for the world&apos;s least affluent 95%? \n\n— Does all this talk about the &quot;carrying capacity&quot; of the Earth, and how it has been exceeded, perplex and annoy, or possibly frustrate, you? Do you understand that it would take 1.5 Planet Earths to supply human resource needs at our current rate of consumption? And that, at our present rate of &quot;growth&quot;, we could need up to 6 Planet Earths by the end of this century? (Those will be hard to find, let alone build pipelines to.)\n\n— Do you ever wonder whether the multinational corporations that now control (or &quot;own&quot; the &quot;patents&quot; to) 75% of the seed varieties worldwide are improving or worsening the ability of earthlings to feed themselves now and in the immediate future?\n\n— If you&apos;re male (as 49% of us are), are you secure enough to consider evidence that in societies where women have central roles in farming, food production is far more efficient, productive, and sustainable?\n\n— Do you gather facts about problems and then act accordingly, or do you prefer reacting to facts based on a conviction that it&apos;s all just one more plot to make you feel &quot;bad&quot;?\n\n— Do you count yourself among those who are curious and open-minded enough to listen to what agro-ecology experts and actual farmers (using natural cultivation methods outside North America and Europe) have to teach us — even if it means reading film subtitles?\n\nIf so, the news is good: this film is for you.\n\nIn fact, this film may be among the most memorable you&apos;ll ever see. That&apos;s because in the months and years ahead, events now gaining momentum will remind you of its messages more and more frequently.\n\nYou may find it all the more memorable because, unlike other documentaries in this vein, it offers more than a little inspiration in the form of flesh-and-blood, hands-on champions who vigorously defy what appears to be a toxic, inexorably rising tide. They embody and exemplify ways for the 95% to restore and, perhaps, maintain sanity, health ... and survival — once the 95% realize that, with the leverage their numbers and moral force confer, however Quixotic it seems today, they can turn back any tide."

Very real performances, if you&apos;re faint-of-heart be ready for some strong words, and not just obscenities. Wow! They really lay it on the line. Great performances by two of my favorites.",

      "name": "Coping with a fatal brain tumor diagnosis by friends and relatives beautifully portrayed",
      "reviewBody": "I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2011, in the same week that I saw &quot;50/50&quot; (Levine; 2011) with a similar theme. Both portrayed how relatives and friends try to cope with the announcement of an immanent death after a tumor diagnosis. It is particularly interesting to see how some evade the issue, and others rise to the challenge. For most people it is already difficult enough to properly behave after someone has died, even knowing we have established rituals for that. Being diagnosed with cancer is different in many ways, and we have no recipes ready.\n\nBoth films succeed very well in showing how friends and relatives initially react, and how good or bad they find their way later on in dealing with the issues at hand. In many other respects, the two films are very different. The chances for survival, for example, are 50/50 within the film of that name, contrary to the brain tumor diagnosed in Stopped On Track, being not curable in any way. The latter is the prime reason that humor is as good as absent in that film, while it is a prominent feature of 50/50, regardless of the fact that the spine tumor in 50/50 may prove just as fatal.\n\nThe brain tumor is impossible to operate, and chemo nor radiation therapy seem to offer any relief. Telling everyone around what is going on, cannot be postponed very long. It will become apparent in a few months time anyway. But is it wise to tell the whole ugly truth to the daughter (12 years old) and son (8 years)?? And how will the grandparents deal with the bad news??\n\nFrom very close nearby we observe all subsequent phases leading to the inevitable death: sudden headaches, memory loss, problems with daily tasks, and more such side effects of deterioration. The constant daily burden works out very differently on the family members. The wife admits aloud that there are moments that she cannot take it anymore, and that she is happy when she can escape to her work. The daughter creates distance and is often away. We see similar differences in approach with others. That the good moments decrease and the bad moments increase obviously causes all sorts of cracks in mutual relationships.\n\nWe see the months pass by. Visiting friends and relatives try to communicate with him, mostly with unexpected results when ancient memories hijack the dialog. We see him become weaker and weaker, mostly because of steadily rising doses of morphine he gets. A benefit of the sedation is that the home situation becomes gradually more quiet. In the meantime all get used to the idea that the end is near.\n\nThe finale of this film is predictable, given what the doctor said at the beginning (this cannot be construed as a spoiler). The important message lies in what happened in between, how everyone was able (or not) to deal with the situation. It lets us ponder how we would behave ourselves when this happened in our own lives. Maybe the film prepares us for it, and makes us a better patient, friend or family member.\n\nAll in all, I&apos;m very satisfied with the film, the main actors and the ingredients for the story. You cannot help getting involved in how these people react, and their problems in doing their best, but not always succeed in that. I gave it 5 stars (out of 5) for the public prize competition when leaving the theater.",

      "reviewBody": "When Goldie Hawn and Garry Shandling&apos;s marriage crumbles because of his infidelity, their friends are shocked. How could he? How could she not suspect? Does every man cheat and he was unlucky enough to get caught? Diane Keaton&apos;s mind whirls while she proudly defends her own faithful husband, Warren Beatty, not knowing he&apos;s been far from innocent in his marital conduct.\n\nMuch like a 1960s sex comedy, this witty situational comedy has a lot of jokes but very little vulgarity. For example, there&apos;s a scene where Warren Beatty goes to the kitchen in the middle of the night for a snack. He&apos;s soon joined by his daughter&apos;s boyfriend, the cook&apos;s boyfriend, and his son. They&apos;re all in their underwear and it&apos;s clear what they were doing minutes earlier, but nothing is shown or explicitly talked about. Modern comedies actively promote show-and-tell, and it&apos;s refreshing to go back a few years and rent something cleaner.\n\nWhile Warren juggles his wife and his brief distraction, Natasssja Kinski, he&apos;s also tempted by Goldie Hawn, Andie MacDowell, and Jenna Elfman. You&apos;ll also see Charlton Heston, as a silly, gun-toting protective father, Marian Seldes as a foul-mouthed grump, and Josh Hartnett as Warren&apos;s son. Check this one out if you prefer your movies on the tame side.",

It&apos;s been too long since I&apos;ve seen it to give it a good critique, but from what I recall, it was a pretty interesting movie, if a little disturbing at times. There&apos;s a lot more gore in movies today, but you knew that in this movie, it&apos;s real."

My question is those involved were members of the nobility, early Spanish settler.

Laws of physics actually state that objects fall at the same speed no matter how heavy they are. Try it with a penny and a book at the top of your house. So don&apos;t talk about laws of physics if you are uninformed about something that is taught pretty much on Day One of Physics 101. So you may argue that it&apos;s still impossible to catch up with the elephant. Yah, it probably is, but if he went into a dive motion (a la James Bond in the beginning of Goldeneye) it&apos;s possible to decrease air resistance and increase aerodynamics in such a way to fall faster. Stunt sky-divers do it all the time. So that&apos;s the second reason why you&apos;re wrong. Talk to you later and hope you have fun posting opinionated comments about something when you have no basis or knowledge for opinion."

This is the best of that duo with a lot of laugh-out loud scenes. There are tons of gags, both obvious and subtle. In fact, I think is one of Martin&apos;s funniest performances. Kathleen Turner, his co-star here, played a similar role in another black comedy &quot;Serial Mom.&quot; There, too, she played a woman who appeared to be nice on the outside but was evil inside. Turner also liked to show a lot of skin in those &apos;80s flicks, which included &quot;Body Heat.&quot;\n\nI had remembered this as a strictly light comedy but was surprised when I viewed it again this year and heard all the sex jokes. Reiner turned out to be a dirty old man but he write and direct some very funny movies. It&apos;s unusual for a comedy to be rated &quot;R,&quot; but that was the appropriate rating. If you know and don&apos;t care if its a bit raunchy, this is a very funny movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Lovecraft&apos;s stories don&apos;t translate well to film. Much of their effect comes from the personal horror the characters feel at what they&apos;re seeing, and it would take a true filmmaking genius to bring something like that across; if such a person has existed they have not taken aim at Lovecraft&apos;s works. The other problem is that it&apos;s hard to stretch his short stories out into movie length. Those who try, usually introduce elements that distract from the true flavor and atmosphere of the stories. &quot;Necronomicon&quot; falls into that trap, despite preserving the short stories as separate segments. The first story, which combines elements of &quot;The Strange High House in the Mist&quot; and &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot;, among others, is the most successful at preserving the evil and terrifying atmosphere of Lovecraft&apos;s works. The second is a direct adaptation of &quot;Cool Air&quot;, a story whose one cool concept doesn&apos;t adapt well to a segment of this length. The third segment (actually based on &quot;The Nameless City&quot; and not &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; as some here have said) winds up being a hamhanded gorefest with no finesse and only a casual relationship to Lovecraft&apos;s work. It&apos;s not as though gore wasn&apos;t an element in Lovecraft&apos;s stories, with characters being &quot;torn to ribbons&quot; and all; but it always takes the form of horrifying and unspeakable things that happen and is never present for cheap thrills&apos; sake as it is here. If you&apos;re a fan of Lovecraft&apos;s stories, you&apos;ll probably want to see it. You might not like it very much, but you&apos;ll want to see it anyway. If you really like cheesy horror films, it&apos;ll entertain you. But if you want a good horror film or a good adaptation of H.P.Lovecraft&apos;s works, keep moving."

How has it affected society and how does it continue to affect society? These are just a few of the questions that are addressed in the film. The film features interviews with many different linguists, actors, musicians, artists, politicians, comedians, news commentators, scholars and random people on the streets with intervals of hilarious animation and various television and film clips. The result is a highly entertaining, engaging and fairly well-balanced documentary concerning one of the most controversial words in the English language.\n\nRegardless of whether or not one cares about the issues of free speech and censorship, this film is bound to make all but the humorless laugh their f**king hearts out!\n\nP.S. Billy Connolly is a riot."

      "reviewBody": "Peruvian writer/director Josue Mendez has made a brave little low budget film that deals with a subject currently burgeoning our hospitals in this country as the fallout of the war on Iraq and still plagues the veterans of the Vietnam War - Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (aka Battle Rattle). This is a difficult topic to dramatize without being preachy or maudlin, but Mendez has succeeded where others have failed.\n\nSantiago (Pietro Sibille) is a 23-year-old retired veteran who was conscripted at age 16 and trained to be a killer - assigned to fighting in the war against Ecuador, against terrorists, and against the drug mafia. He returns to his family in Lima a damaged, broken, paranoid misfit who tries to leave his military past behind but mentally returns to it as the only time he felt important. Unable to work he finally begins to drive a taxi and encounters all manner of passengers - wealthy men, girls on the party circuit, disreputable people of all types. He tries desperately to adjust to the post-military life, but find his family in shambles, a wholly dysfunctional unit to which he can no longer relate. How he finds his &apos;place&apos; in this chaos is the subject of Mendez&apos; story (Mendez has based this on a true story/stories and knows his subject well).\n\nPietro Sibille as Santiago delivers a credible performance, one that consistently borders on fragmentation of a mind deeply scarred by war and fighting. The remainder of the cast is fine. Mendez uses a mixture of black and white film with color segments and this is distracting to annoying: if the choices of film related consistently to a tenor in the story (which is not the case) then this technique could be considered artistic.\n\nThe manner in which the story is related is very much in keeping with the fragmented and paranoid mindset of Santiago and for this the director is to be commended for successfully achieving the next to impossible! Many strong points to a film that is flawed by technical problems. Grady Harp",

Sure, the production values weren&apos;t up to current standards and the acting is not top drawer, but somehow what makes it to the screen gets under your skin and makes it crawl. True horror buffs should be fighting to get a copy of this for their collections - and I don&apos;t understand why it hasn&apos;t received more play in the USA. (OK, so it&apos;s foreign and involves cannibalism and other nasty things; is that any reason to pass it over?!) The young Franco Nero in this feature shows the acting promise of the later movies he appeared in, a number of them made for US audiences.",

While clocking in at a nearly three-hour running time, there isn&apos;t a single wasted scene, it is always entertaining and I think it is very rewatchable too. The cinematography, locations and scenery are superb, and the film&apos;s atmosphere and pace are also terrific. The story is plausible and beautifully structured with a breathtaking sequence towards the middle of the film, and there are a lot of memorable quotes. Heat is also brilliantly directed by Michael Mann and the acting of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino is exemplary. So all in all, brilliant and absolutely worth it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

However, the baby died, and they have to live with the consequences.\n\nThe plot outline describes a promising start of an emotional drama. It could have been a captivating story if it was elaborated well. However, the plot ends there. The filmmakers ran out of ideas of what to do, and hence film a car driving around the city for minutes, or film the urban apartment blocks from a rooftop. Or throw in some sex scenes to keep viewers interested.\n\nThere is almost no portrayal of Ana and Marco&apos;s states of mind after the kidnapping goes wrong. There is no description of the victim&apos;s family&apos;s grief. Instead, the film wanders around aimlessly and pointlessly. It fails to engage, captivate or evoke any emotions. &quot;Battle in Heaven&quot; describes no battles. It lacks any redeeming value, and I strongly suggest staying away from it."

But I&apos;m not disappointed like all the others who wrote a comment here. It has more story than the average Hong Kong movie and the acting is also of a high standard. I agree that it could use some more action scenes, but the few action scenes look totally great! I don&apos;t know if it is historically correct (I don&apos;t think so) but what movies are?\n\nIf you want to see a good Hong Kong movie without the cheesy humor most of them have but with great acting and a nice story then give this one a try. It&apos;s not for all you kung fu action freaks although I think I&apos;m one myself:)"

      "reviewBody": "Gallants manages to find the perfect balance between action, comedy, and drama, with a relatable story and some of the best hand-to-hand action scenes I have ever seen.\n\nThe comedy is spot-on, contrary to the Hollywood approach, Hong Kong filmmakers don&apos;t go overboard - or so it seems -. While the main character, Cheung (Wong You-nam) is pretty funny, most of the comedic relief is done by Master Ben Law (Teddy Robin Kwan), who reminds me of Jackie Chan&apos;s uncle in the animated series Jackie Chan Adventures. Apparently, this is an estereotyped depiction of Hong Kongese elders.\n\nThe action, on the other hand, is on par with its comedic greatness - if not better -. The film has some of the best hand-to-hand combat I have ever seen. Unlike Hollywood, Hong Kong films don&apos;t seem to rely on constant cuts during the fight scenes, so the viewer can actually appreciate the action happening. I personally prefer this style.\n\nThe acting was great. From the leads to the supporting cast, everyone plays their part to perfection. JJ Jia, as one of the few female characters, particularly caught my attention in her portrayal of Kwai.\n\nDirectors Derek Kwok and Clement Cheng&apos;s use of rapid cuts and zoom, especially during face-offs make the film go from serious to funny and vice versa in a second. Also, Gallants was filmed in eighteen days!? It just got to show the incredible amount of quality good writing and direction can get when they keep things simple. Bravo!\n\nThe definitive Hong Kongese action comedy to me.",

Patrick Bergin, a really fine actor, is worth watching. Not easy acting under 40lbs. of make up."

They just change up the details. What the writer/director does in TSOS is to take risks and take on some difficult issues. Instead of having the actors explain everything as we&apos;re going along, he takes the risk of allowing the film to develop on its own.\n\nIf you go to watch a film made from Hollywood you might get that &quot;wow&quot; effect... but what about the second, third, fourth time? Do you get more out of each time? Or do you just find the same? With TSOS it&apos;s more like a play or novel. There are enough layers that you don&apos;t completely understand the story in its full extent until you watch it over and over again. It&apos;s like strong medicine and some of the weaker critics who only like &quot;fluff films&quot; and &quot;cheap entertainment experiences&quot; won&apos;t appreciate what this film has to offer.",

Parents Jane Wyatt and Donald Cook have three beautiful daughters, Ann Blyth, Joan Evans, and Natalie Wood in descending order. It&apos;s a red letter day in the family with Ann&apos;s impending graduation from high school.\n\nThe girls have their usual teen problems including a nice little rivalry between Blyth and Evans for Farley Granger. But when Evans while looking for her own birth certificate finds Blyth&apos;s adoption papers, she uses them without measuring the consequences.\n\nThe film is nice family entertainment for the time and I have to say the sentiment is kept in check for this type of film. Our Very Own got an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Recording.\n\nBut the young leads Granger and Blyth are too old and look it to be playing teens. Granger was 25 and Blyth 22. On the other hand Joan Evans was 16 and Martin Milner 19 and the script has them a year younger than Granger and Blyth. There&apos;s also a great performance by Ann Dvorak as Blyth&apos;s birth mother.\n\nStill Ann delivers a nice performance and it really would have been nice had they given her a song to sing, maybe at the climax which is the graduation.",

      "name": "Another internationally neglected Salvatore Samperi film",
      "reviewBody": "Savatore Samperi is considered one of Italy&apos;s best directors in the comedy-drama genre, but international recognition has largely eluded him, perhaps because international releases of his films have been horribly, horribly dubbed into English (like his most seminal film &quot;Malizia&quot;) or given wildly appropriate English-language titles (like the exploitative UK title of this one).\n\nThis movie is set in the late 1940&apos;s, a few years after the trauma of WWII and during 1948 Italian elections when the Italian Communist Party was surprising defeated at the polls (an election many now believe was stolen by the American CIA). The political events are mostly kept in the background, however, as this story is told from the perspective of a precocious nine-year-old boy, &quot;Ju&quot;. His parents are both emotionally damaged from the deprivations of war--there&apos;s an uncomfortable scene where he watches his mother (Paola Senatore) sexually service his father (Ugo Tognazzi), marks on her backside evident from the switch his abusive father likes to use on his family members (especially the female ones). The boy&apos;s larger awakening into adulthood, however, comes courtesy of his orphaned older cousin &quot;Nene&quot; (Leanora Fani), who comes to stay with his family. The teenage girl lets him sleep in her bed and confides him about her burgeoning sexuality and the illicit affair she is having with a local mulatto hood.\n\nObviously, this movie broaches some subjects Anglo-Americans especially are rather paranoid about these days, but I don&apos;t think it really deserves comparison to the notorious &quot;Maladolescenza&quot;. This is a serious art film, not exploitation. Perhaps some of the confusion is in the casting. Leanora Fani, who was actually quite a bit older than she looks here, was generally in much sleazier movies (i.e. in &quot;Beastialita&quot; she played a girl romantically in love with a dog). And Paola Senatore later became a bonafide hardcore porn star (although only briefly and as the result of serious drug addiction). Both actresses, however, were beautiful and talented and very unlike the stereotype of porn stars today. And while their respective roles here have a certain sexual frankness, they&apos;re still a long way from porn or other lurid exploitation. Ugo Tognazzi was more respected actor perhaps, but even he did later direct some Edwige Fenech sex comedies and he was in Marco Ferreti&apos;s outrageous art-house hit &quot;Le Gran Bouffe&quot;. What it really comes down to is that the Italians in the 70&apos;s simply didn&apos;t &quot;ghetto-ize&quot; and compartmentalize sexually-themed films and the actors that appeared in them the way Anglo-Americans do, especially today. But I&apos;m not so sure this is such a bad thing.\n\nAlong with &quot;Malizia&quot; and &quot;Scandalo&quot;, this is a Samperi film that desperately needs to be released with some decent Englsh subtitles (the version I saw looked good, but only had Italian subtitles). It would do much to rehabilitate the reputation of one of Italy&apos;s most talented 70&apos;s era directors."

      "reviewBody": "It took me nearly 15 minutes to get into this movie. But (gladly!) once it grasped me, there was no turning back. This is an &apos;existential angst&apos; inspired masterpiece; a movie with more questions than answers. And, it was also a movie that, quite frankly, I wished hadn&apos;t ended so soon. Yes... I definitely enjoyed it that much! &apos;Reconstruction&apos; was as psychologically perplexing as it was beautifully haunting. And I now find it hard to fault it. So... I won&apos;t.\n\nHowever, as is the case with most of the movies I adore, I doubt that all people would concur with my estimation. That being said, it would definitely appeal to someone who enjoyed Memento; or maybe even Irreversible.\n\nThe core theme explored in this movie is that of knowing oneself and those close to you: Appearance versus reality. The true existentialist never finds profound comfort in the purportedly comfortable. For there are often surprises to be found on deeper reflection... I shall say no more. But if you&apos;ve just digested a couple of chapters of &apos;Being &amp; Nothingness&apos;, I could think of few better ways to further lose yourself in the problems of the mind and existence, than to watch this film afterwards.\n\nThe acting, screenplay, direction, score, filming and production all very much made the grade. Overall, Reconstruction is a psychologically challenging movie that any thinker should profoundly enjoy (once, that is, one gets into the psychological mysteries which unfold). Albeit, to paraphrase another reviewer: the intellectually challenged, and/or those who need all questions resolved in any movie, should hastily move along to another film.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Anarchism in America&quot;, a documentary from 1983, has arrived on DVD for the first time to share its knowledge and message to a new generation. Maybe that&apos;s the thought behind releasing this documentary on the often misunderstood subject of anarchy. The filmmakers set off on a trek across the United States in search of the anarchic voice. Through a well-intentioned, but amateurish approach, they take the viewer through a few bits of historical footage and information to offer a glimpse at the true nature of anarchism in America&apos;s past. These infrequent bits become nuisances to the true meat of the production, which is not footage of the team of filmmakers driving cross country (though there&apos;s plenty of that) or a last minute arrival of the punk band Dead Kennedys (which feels tacked on), but the interviews with a few highly studied and intelligent voices on the subject. A better film seemingly could have been made from this footage, but unfortunately none of that skill or realization is here. Maybe the point of making such a messy, under-realized film was a broader statement on anarchism, but that&apos;s not likely.",

I thought it had the potential to be real interesting - a realistic portrayal of counterculture in Beijing.\n\nUnfortunately, it is a bad film.\n\nThe youth at the center of the film are simply boring subjects. Most of the film is spent following them around during their daily lives. Nothing interesting happens. \n\nOccasionally they make comments the superficiality of society, materialism and what not. Nothing too profound here. Nothing that hasn&apos;t been said before.\n\nAnd many of the youth are hypocritical. They think they are special, living against the grain. But the image I got is that they are very much part of the commercial culture. They also have dreams of getting rich and buying big houses.\n\nProbably the most annoying thing about this film is that the vast majority of the dialogue is in English - both the filmmakers, Germans, and the Chinese subjects, speaking in broken English.\n\nIn a film about China, why don&apos;t they speak Chinese?"

The old palace seems lost but here come the ghosts which manage to create a Caravaggio-like painting in the palace, which is so declared national monument and saved from destruction. A little satirical masterpiece about real estate speculation in 1950s Italy. And a great cast with the best Italian actors of the time: Eduardo, Buazzelli, Gassman and Mastroianni playing three characters.",

The Boy knows nothing of what the yellow stuff is and Tarzan could care less as it doesn&apos;t effect his style of living, but Jane knows and wants it kept secret for all concerned.\n\nA scientific expedition saves young Sheffield from the clutches of a savage tribe and Johnny Weissmuller is naturally grateful. But when the kid gives away the secret of the gold two of the white men, Tom Conway and Phillip Dorn get real greedy as Maureen O&apos;Sullivan knew they would. Not even the protestations of the expedition leader Reginald Owen dissuades the other two, in fact they withhold fever medicine from him so Owen dies.\n\nThis episode of the Tarzan saga is nicely done and contains every kind of jungle peril out there, savage native tribes, attacking rhinoceros, lions, elephants and crocodiles. The last two figure in a very exciting climax when Tarzan puts things right in his jungle paradise.\n\nTarzan&apos;s Secret Treasure also features a very droll performance by Barry Fitzgerald as a most lucky Irishman who was along on the expedition. Fitzgerald&apos;s character has a good heart and does earn Tarzan&apos;s gratitude for services above and beyond. But as the film ends I believe Weissmuller and O&apos;Sullivan are trusting a bit much to man&apos;s better nature in regard to him.\n\nAll in all, not too bad a Tarzan film.",

      "reviewBody": "Les Bidasses en Folie, a french movie from 1971, is a very short, easy to watch, slapstick hippie comedy. The gags are always very physical, and during the first half hour of movie they work and it&apos;s pretty enjoyable and funny. It&apos; outdated and supposed to be cool, and that makes it even funnier. You laugh at how ridiculous it is. Then, the five characters go to war, and you just grow tired of watching them fall and acting stupid, even if it&apos;s still funny. The actors have some good body language, and the gags are funny, but it lacks any link of decent storyline or characters. It&apos;s just fluff, cute and sugar coated, with a positive feeling. It can leave you with a smile on your face, as some of the moments are spot on. Fortunately, it&apos;s short, because if it had 5 minutes more you&apos;d be incredibly tired of watching this. It&apos;s not my type of humor, but it&apos;s not bad. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this, except if you have nothing else to do and only want some fluffy, 70&apos;s styled movie."

      "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re expecting an epic like Devdas, well, this movie will disappoint you. But if you&apos;re just looking for a nice romantic comedy to pass the time, then this movie will do just that. It&apos;s delightful and charming, and will pull on your heartstrings at the right times too. Aishwarya Rai is stunningly beautiful as usual and she gives her character, Diya the right amount of vulnerability. Vivek Oberoi is endearing throughout the whole film. The strongest part of the film is the beginning, in my opinion. It progresses the fastest and most of the comedy is found there. I found the second half of the movie to be a bit slower. But don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not slow enough to make your interest wane. Also, as a bonus, Amitabh Bachchan makes his appearance in the second half. Although the second half slows down a bit like I mentioned, it does lead up very well to the ending. I don&apos;t understand some of the comments made that Vivek and Aishwarya have no chemistry because I thought they had it in spades. Where this film succeeds is through the characters. The movie makes you care for them, and when they&apos;re happy, you&apos;re happy, and when they&apos;re sad, you&apos;re heartbroken for them. I highly recommend this film.",

Charlotte Rampling plays in the same way from very angry and violent to very passionate. I think that the fact that the film shows the two faces of the characters makes it very interesting and amusing.\n\nThe gags in the film come from the British and the french humor, actually I love both, so a film which has them, couldn&apos;t be boring. \n\nThe rest of the cast is fine, with a lovely English accent, and from the french part: Isabelle Nanty, who is well-known in France, she usually plays in comedies but characters who have different qualities.\n\nsorry for my English, but I really recommend the film to people who like British and french gags.",

While few people have ever seen this film, it rates as one of the best films ever in regards to Latin American cinema. Sure, the budgetary constraints can be seen in many parts of this film, but the overall artistic stamp of the film more than makes up for the lack thereof. In our current society of anti-immigration,\n\none has to experience the pain and torment some of the people have to experience just to get the chance to live in America. This spirit alone gives me respect for most working immigrants, even if some are illegal. Even 20 years from now, Latin American film courses will still use this film as one of its finest examples.",

Other than that, it has no distinction whatsoever except that it provides a nice comic book excursion into the past with lavish sets of Oriental splendor but little else for compensation.\n\nStill, it&apos;s watchable enough thanks to the low-key and quietly humorous performance of GARY COOPER (an unlikely choice for the role of the Italian adventurer from Venice). It&apos;s also interesting to watch SIGRID GURIE, fascinating in close-ups with Hollywood&apos;s brand of Oriental make-up--but an actress who never managed to be more than a passing fancy.\n\nBASIL RATHBONE adds the right touch of menace as Ahmed, the villain of the piece, and ALAN HALE brings his boisterous presence to the role of a man who was afraid of his lecherous wife (BINNIE BARNES) but not afraid to dispose of his enemies in boiling oil.\n\nIt gets more laughable as it goes on, but reaches new heights of incredibility with an ending that has Polo making use of explosives to bring down the enemy camp. His final fight to the death with Rathbone, near an open trap door with hungry lions waiting below and vultures overhead, is the stuff of comic book suspense.\n\nIf you can suspend all disbelief long enough to enjoy it, it passes the time quickly and entertainingly. A history lesson, it&apos;s not.",

      "reviewBody": "Charles Chaplin had a love-hate relationship with the United States of America. On the one hand, it was in Hollywood that the British-born comedian and filmmaker built a successful life and career, immortalising himself as one of the most beloved directors and stars in the history of cinema. On the other hand, Chaplin&apos;s political attitudes during the 1940s  that America should form an alliance with the Soviet Union in order to fight Adolf Hitler&apos;s fascist regime  led to his being labelled a Communist or Communist sympathiser. In 1952, Chaplin returned to his home-town of London for the premiere of the brilliant &apos;Limelight (1952),&apos; where he was greeted with great enthusiasm, though with his arrival came the news that the American government had rescinded his re-entry visa into the United States. Over the next few years, the aging filmmaker toyed with numerous ideas for his next film  including a possible resurrection of the Little Tramp  before settling upon &apos;A King in New York,&apos; whose screenplay took about two years to complete.\n\n&apos;A King in New York (1957)&apos; tells the story of King Shahdov (Chaplin), a dethroned monarch who seeks refuge in the United States, his entire wealth cunningly stolen from him. The film starts off as an amiable slapstick comedy, which is basically what I had been expecting, before branching off into darker territory, become a scathing satiric assault on almost everything that America stands for. When he first arrives in the country, King Shahdov revels in the peace and liberty of this grand nation, exclaiming to his dedicated ambassador, Jaume (Oliver Johnston): &quot;if you knew what it means to breathe this free air. This wonderful, wonderful America. Its youth, its genius, its vitality!&quot; However, through his relationship with a brilliant young boy, Rupert Macabee (Chaplin&apos;s own son, Michael), whose parents happen to be members of the Communist party, Shahdov becomes embroiled in the period&apos;s rampant McCarthyist witch-hunts, revealing the devastating truth that perhaps America&apos;s notions of freedom have become a mere illusion.\n\nDespite Chaplin&apos;s insistence that &quot;my picture isn&apos;t political,&quot; it most undoubtedly is, with the director  just as he did in the final scenes of &apos;Monsieur Verdoux (1947)&apos;  evidently expressing his distaste for what society has become. It&apos;s easy to dismiss &apos;A King in New York&apos; as pro-socialist propaganda, but to do so would be completely missing the very idea behind the film. Personally, I&apos;m unsure of Chaplin&apos;s official stance on Communism itself, but the filmmaker certainly reviled the manner in which the United States government approached the issue, citing it as an immoral invasion of privacy and liberty. Chaplin described himself as having no political convictions: &quot;I am an individualist, and I believe in liberty.&quot; Perhaps referring to the Hollywood blacklist, he once said: &quot;These are days of turmoil and strife and bitterness. This is not the day of great artists; this is the day of politics.&quot;\n\n&apos;A King in New York&apos; was filmed at Shepparton Studios in London, and the film does a very successful job of imitating the hustle-and-bustle of the Big Apple. As well as expressing his stance on McCarthyism, Chaplin also aims a few effective jabs at commercialisation and popular culture, prophetically predicting the prominence of commercial chain-stores, cosmetic surgery and reality television {when King Shahdov is unwittingly coaxed into attending a televised dinner party, continually baffled as to why his lady interest (Dawn Addams) keeps unexpectedly launching into advertisements}. Though my review has stressed the political implications of the film, &apos;A King in New York&apos; also works pretty well as a light comedy, and I almost died laughing when Chaplin walked into the House Committee on Un-American Activities with a fire-hose attached to his finger. Michael Chaplin&apos;s impassioned tirades on the degradation of America were also a riot to watch, even if the young actor can occasionally be spotted mouthing his father&apos;s lines. Owing to its somewhat disagreeable stance towards the United States, Chaplin was unable to find any willing American distributors, and so &apos;A King in New York&apos; remained unseen there until the 1970s. &quot;Freedom of speech,&quot; indeed.",

      "reviewBody": "A film within a film within a film that plays out through a myriad of interconnected stories sewn into a giant multi-colored tapestry. The so called &quot;Armenian holocaust&quot; is the fabric from which director Egoyan spins his narrative, and this event so heavily laden with emotional baggage, becomes almost impossible to approach with intellectual objectivity. The lines between fact and fiction are constantly blurred as in a scene where the protagonist walks onto a movie set about the &quot;holocaust&quot; and one of the characters scolds her, not as an actor, but as a very real character from that time. At times this constant commingling loses focus, but Egoyan&apos;s heartfelt attempt to bring back the dead through his art imitating art approach, succeeds surprisingly well. Although the &quot;holocaust&quot; is shown graphically, Egoyan is aware that we connect most deeply with that to which we can all relate, and this is shown right from the start as an artist attempts to transfer his childhood memories of murdered loved ones to a painter&apos;s canvas; the details of a mothers dress . . . the skin of a mothers hand . . . her fingers knitting a quilt. The vivid colors and simple reality of that hand are so compelling they can reach out across decades of despair to caress the forehead, reduce fever, and impart a sense of belonging - a reason for being. From this inauspicious beginning, Egoyan is able to arrive at a much greater truth: the inherent need for human beings to believe in something - whether or not that belief is grounded in reality or can be proved scientifically. Finally, ARATAT concludes with a simple truth that is just as powerful: the immeasurable but often neglected joy at being able to look upon our loved ones and to hold them in an embrace of life.",

      "reviewBody": "This stage to screen adaptation about two estranged sisters attempting a reconciliation after one is diagnosed with cancer is sentimental to the extreme, manipulative beyond forgiveness.....and had me close to blubbering like a baby by the time it was over.\n\nChalk it up to the fact that I had recently lost a grandmother to cancer, but this film nearly devastated me even as I was mad that it was so maudlin. The fact that it works as well as it does is due largely to the fact that such good actors are cast in it. Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton play the sisters (Keaton is the ill one), and while it would never have occurred to me to put these two actresses together, the decision was inspired. And right before he rocketed to international fame, Leonardo DiCaprio does strong work as Keaton&apos;s troubled nephew.\n\nI won&apos;t even try to defend this film against those who say it&apos;s too schmaltzy to bear, but please let the rest of us enjoy it in blubbery peace.\n\nGrade: A-",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is extremely well made.  Make sure you get the original director&apos;s cut, or Special Edition as they are calling it on the DVD.  It includes the real ending, along with more than 20 minutes of additional footage.  The morons from the studio in Hollywood decided that the public wouldn&apos;t want to see a nearly 3-hour underwater adventure, and forced James Cameron to cut it down and change the ending.  The ending the studios insisted on is your typical boring old done-a-million-times happy ending, and does not work.  It betrays the message of the film, and makes it nothing more than a good underwater shoot-em-up.  This movie is much more than that. See the REAL ending to understand why it is so important to this film.  As opposed to the canned studio ending, the REAL one makes you think.  Well, what did you expect?  Hollywood executives make movies for the common herd, they dumb them down to make sure every patron goes away feeling happy.  God forbid that anyone actually may have to think a little.  At the time, despite a few solid hits (such as the original Terminator), James Cameron wasn&apos;t enough of a power in La-La land to force the studios to release the movie as he wanted it to be.  After Titanic, they will do whatever he says, so we can now expect some great Cameron films to look forward to, rather than having to wait for the REAL movie to come out years later on a Special Edition DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "Sahara was a pretty good action movie in the same mold as Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider &amp; National Treasure. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it probably would not have worked as well without the comedic duo of Matthew McConaughey and Steve Zahn. Penélope Cruz pulled her weight as well. She reminded me so much of Salma Hayek that I would swear they are related.\n\nTreasure Hunters Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino (McConaughey &amp; Zahn) manage to get their hands on a rare confederate coin, apparently which only 5 were made. It would have made quite a collector&apos;s item. Dirk has a hunch on where the ship it had originated from is now and also has a theory on how it got there, in the middle of the desert. Dirk manages to convince his boss, Admiral Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy), to loan him his boat for 3 days to search for the missing ship.\n\nBefore they get going, they run into two W.H.O. workers, one of who was the beautiful Eva Rojas (Penélope Cruz). They need a ride and manage to get on board with Dirk and Al, but by doing so, they get the attention of an African dictator, who wants to stop them before they get too close.\n\nThere are quite a few action scenes and for what it was, I was entertained throughout the movie. More so than I would have though, which is why I waited so long to see it. Like I mentioned above, I do not think I would have enjoyed it as much without McConaughey. He added sort of a friendly charm to the movie and if that is not enough, Penélope Cruz should make up the difference."

This means two things. It&apos;s got the classic b-movie cheese, the style before everything was done with computer effects. But also, I get the irritating feeling that it&apos;s &quot;not a very good movie&quot;. Even when I was a teenager I sometimes felt this same thing when watching action movies. I liked them but at the same time even as a youngster I sometimes felt a bit stupid, like wasting my time with those movies.\n\nRutger Hauer is a cool actor and for some reason I haven&apos;t ever seen many of his films. But now I started to check them out because fans of cheesy action movies often mention Rutger&apos;s name as some sort of cult icon. He does have a certain charm and makes this movie enjoyable.\n\nI was maybe expecting a little bit more action. There are big guns but they are being shot only rarely, and most of the film is like a detective thriller drama. But the action scenes are nicely divided throughout the movie so it doesn&apos;t get too boring.\n\nSo, I&apos;m not going to take a Rutger Hauer tattoo but I&apos;m probably going to watch a couple more of his movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Anna (Felicity Jones) and Jacob (Anton Yelchin) are in love with each like crazy. Hence the title, &quot;Like Crazy&quot;. They are in, or want to be in, a grown-up relationship — one where they act like adults and are just a part of each other&apos;s lives. But they met each other at college and one stupid idea forces them to make grown-up decisions that will affect the rest of their lives quicker than they would have liked.\n\n&quot;Like Crazy&quot; is just about their relationship. We watch as they fall in love, grow apart, find a middle road, and then try and pick an extreme. Anna is a writer and Jacob is a furniture constructor. But their lives are just so inconsequential to the film which is the way it has to be when it is only about their relationship.\n\nThe film is minimal in story, in characters, in budget, and in production. And that&apos;s what makes it so sweet. Made for only $250,000 and edited in the director&apos;s bedroom, it&apos;s a story and film of passion.\n\nI found it to be very similar to &quot;Blue Valentine&quot; (2010), but perhaps not as impactful — at least to me. Both played to rave reviews at Sundance, last year &quot;Blue&quot; picked up the Grand Jury Prize nomination, this year &quot;Crazy&quot; got the Jury win for both director Drake Doremus and actress Felicity Jones.\n\nI first saw Felicity Jones last year in &quot;Cemetery Junction&quot; (2010). She played this beautifully innocent girl in a town where innocence just doesn&apos;t really exist. In &quot;Like Crazy&quot; she plays a beautiful, adult-like young woman growing up in a world of love but learns that she might not know what love is after all.",

Knowing the person of writer/director Rolf Olsen, he was a master in his class giving the audience exactly the movies the wanted or - in this case - deserved. It is a pity you don&apos;t see Olsen as an actor here, because his intended overacting gives most of his movies a touch of an vaudeville act. Nevertheless most of this movie is not worth to mention, but compared to today&apos;s teenager-aimed uhm... comedies this one stands at least for some laughs, thanks to the performances of Gunther Philipp, Ruth Stephan and (Dr.) Kurt Nachmann. Besides that, Hansi Kraus is once again Hansi Kraus, and the rest is not worth mentioning.\n\nThe story itself is a weird mish-mash and has neither point nor punchline, but obviously the movie did its job in its days. \n\nBesides all that it&apos;s an interesting fact that the movie - although set in Upper Bavaria - was shot entirely in Carinthia/Austria.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ardh Satya&quot; is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.\n\nThe film tells the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any Police of other cities in India, Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.\n\nAmongst various Police officers &amp; colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father&apos;s ideologies &amp; incidences of his father&apos;s Atrocities on his mother. Anand&apos;s approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand&apos;s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms &amp; bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.\n\nThe Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro, where the Police &amp; Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.\n\nThe Direction is a master piece &amp; thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty&apos;s house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes, the film has Hair-raising moments.\n\nThe Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism, Corruption, Political Influence, Courage, Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.\n\nFinally, the films belongs to the One man show, Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.",

      "reviewBody": "Yojimbo, based on noir writer Dashiel Hammett&apos;s Red Harvest is a magnificently entertaining film. Toshiro Mifune stars as the nobody who calls himself Sanjuro (thirty but closer to forty). He enters a town destroyed by warring factions and plays a double-game to pit one faction against the other thus destroying the criminal element.\n\nYojimbo (aka The Bodyguard) is one of the coolest and most stylish films ever made. Starring Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa&apos;s favorite actor, as the scruffy looking Samurai, Yojimbo has all of Kurosawa&apos;s qualities and none of the flaws. The music score is an essential element of the plot and strikingly good, but admittedly bettered by the Ennio Morricone version in the Spaghetti Western remake Fistful of Dollars. The visuals are great, from the samurai swordplay, to the desolate streets, the town crier announcing its 3 a.m. to the brutal torture scene.\n\nOne of the unique things about Yojimbo is the central character. He is an anti-hero. We see him initially as a killer and a man greedy for money. But then, he saves a family by re-uniting mother and child and giving them all the money he was advanced. Mifune has never been cooler than in this film and Eastwood could only aspire to equal such a performance.\n\nOf the two remakes, I liked Fistful of Dollars for starting the Spaghetti Western genre, although Yojimbo is a far more superior and stylish film. The gangster version, Last Man Standing, was not very good and Bruce Willis made for a poor substitute to Yojimbo. This film looks fresh and undated even today - watch it!",

      "reviewBody": "If you strongly dislike films that are predictable, clichéd or derivative, and you&apos;re not showing Racing Stripes to kids, you should avoid this movie. Well, at least looking at things somewhat pessimistically. Ideally, you should sort out the conceptual errors you&apos;re making and see the movie, because it is a very good film. The Cult of Originality had it wrong. Artworks aren&apos;t inherently more valuable just because they&apos;re unprecedented, and they&apos;re not inherently less valuable just because they&apos;re engaging in a well-established form, or &quot;template&quot;, to put it in more modern terms.\n\nStripes is a zebra who is orphaned at the beginning of the film when a traveling circus accidentally leaves him behind during a storm. Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood) finds him and brings him back to his Kentucky farm (actually South Africa doubling as Kentucky). Walsh, a recent widower, has a teenaged daughter, Channing (Hayden Panettiere), who works at the local horse track for a mean, snooty and rich boss lady, Clara Dalrymple (Wendie Malick). The horse track is the heart of the town. The farm next door to the Walsh&apos;s breeds racehorses, and in fact, Walsh used to breed and train racehorses, too, for Clara, and it&apos;s implied that Walsh&apos;s wife, a former champion jockey, died in a horse-racing accident.\n\nMeanwhile, Stripes is trying to adjust to life on the Walsh farm, which means assimilating with a motley crew of animals. All of the animals can talk to each other, &quot;Mister Ed&quot; (1961)-style, but in the more traditional filmic instantiation of talking animals, they can&apos;t talk to humans, although it is implied that they can at least slightly understand human speech. Stripes knows he looks different, but he figures he&apos;s a horse, like the racehorses next door, because that&apos;s what he looks closest to. Their teasing because he looks different merely creates a stronger desire for him to fit in and even best them, which naturally means a growing desire to race.\n\nAny older cinephile could probably fill in the basic developments of the plot, up to and including the ending, given the premises above. The important consideration is not whether Racing Stripes is unprecedented, but how well it does what it sets out to do. The formulaic aspects of the plot, as with all artworks that engage with some traditional &quot;formula&quot;, enhance Racing Stripes rather than detracting from it by (a) filling in a deep milieu of shared meaning, signifiers and so on, and (b) underscoring the ways in which Racing Stripes makes its variations on the form. It&apos;s a good film both because it executes the basics of the form so well and because the variations are well done, creative and entertaining. That&apos;s if you&apos;re an adult, at least. For younger audiences, it&apos;s a great film because it&apos;s establishing the form in their minds. The form exists as a template because it&apos;s a very effective, classic plot rooted in a particular kind of cultural mythology. But this instantiation is simply a funny, inspirational story featuring a talking zebra.\n\nFilmic visual manipulation has come a long way in the 40 years since &quot;Mister Ed&quot;. Mister Ed, the original talking horse, was made to &quot;speak&quot; by putting something in his mouth that he would then try to remove. In Racing Stripes, the animal speech is all done through cgi--actually computer animation/manipulation of cinematographic images of the animals&apos; mouths, and it looks incredibly realistic. Like most movies of this sort, Racing Stripes is a pleasure to watch simply for its animal stunts. I suppose one can never get too old or intellectual to enjoy a dancing monkey, so to speak. There are a few instances of animal &quot;stunts&quot; being too dangerous for the animals--such as Stripes&apos; wipeout, so these are animated with cgi, too, and they&apos;re integrated very well.\n\nThere are also two completely cgi-animated characters--flies named Buzz and Scuzz. These are the most consistently comic characters, although as flies, a lot of their visual humor, at least, hinges on jokes about things like garbage, discarded food, manure, and so on.\n\nThe animals are voiced by an all-star cast. Director Frederik Du Chau, in his first live-action film (and only his second film), does an excellent job creating performances from the animals that match the public personalities of the voices. Stripes is Frankie Muniz, and has his innocent precociousness. Dustin Hoffman is an older, small horse named Tucker who provides advice and inspiration, a bit like a cynical Buddha. Snoop Dogg is the family hound, naturally enough, and tends to lie on the porch, chilling out and making sarcastic remarks. Joe Pantoliano is Goose--he made a wrong turn in New Jersey and is now comically trying to pass himself off as a gangster. The flies are David Spade and Steve Harvey, with Spade doing his infamous manic-but-mellow naivety. The human cast is good, too, but they&apos;re really ancillary to the animals. Older cinephiles will especially delight in seeing M. Emmet Walsh as a rumpled &quot;track-rat&quot;.\n\nAs a film primarily targeted at kids and younger teens (although it&apos;s certainly not enjoyable only to them--I&apos;m middle-aged and have no kids), Racing Stripes has a couple &quot;moral of the story&quot; subtexts, and as usual, they&apos;re themes that not only kids can benefit from internalizing. The primary theme is acceptance of difference. Stripes is unlike any being the other animals have encountered, and naturally he is teased, made fun of, ostracized and even physically abused because of it. The gist of the plot is a demonstration that difference isn&apos;t negative. This is often interpreted as a racial theme, but it&apos;s really more general than that, applying to all kinds of differences. The other main theme, acceptance of loss and confrontation of the resultant depression, fear and anger, arrives via Walsh.\n\nCute, funny, heartwarming and a subtly surreal fantasy, Racing Stripes is a great example of why predictability just doesn&apos;t matter when it comes to making a good film.",

Those who&apos;ve read Kirk&apos;s books, &quot;Climbing the Mountain&quot; and &quot;My Stroke of Luck&quot; will realize just how many of Kirk&apos;s real experiences have been written into the role, especially his continuing efforts to improve his damaged speech.  (Who will ever forget the 1995 Academy Awards, when Kirk, just weeks after the stroke, came out to accept his honorary Oscar, and forced recognizable speech out of a mouth that was, at the time, very much a ruined instrument?)  The film begins with a uneasy tenseness that makes it hard to enjoy, but this moderates as we come to know the characters, and a certain largeness of spirit appears when the three generations enter a brothel, run by Lauren Bacall, whose screen magic hasn&apos;t diminished one little bit.  Incidentally, this is only the second film Douglas and Bacall have made together; the first was &quot;Young Man With a Horn&quot; in 1949.  Does that mean we have to wait until 2O49 for them to do it again?",

It is long--just under three hours--but during that three hours, the entire range of human experience is covered. It is about life--that&apos;s it. But, to make a statement about life, you have to illustrate it with lives, and this Yang does exquisitely. There is a tragic undercurrent running through this film, and while I was watching it I thought of Thoreau&apos;s observation that &quot;most men lead lives of quiet desperation.&quot; Yet, in spite of the travails the film&apos;s characters undergo, it is ultimately a work of affirmation. This is about as good as the art of cinema can get.",

She quits her job in the newspaper and meets with her childhood friend Grace by chance in the subway. Grace tells Ro that she had just been dumped by the powerful and wealthy owner of the greatest New Yorker advertising agency, Harrison Hill, and she was threatening to tell his wife about their affair. When Grace is found dead, Harrison becomes Rowena&apos;s prime suspect. With the support of her hacker friend and former colleague Miles Haley, Ro is hired for a temporary work in Harrison&apos;s agency to get close to the executive and investigate his life.\n\nI was looking forward to this film, although critics panned it. I heard that there was a twist ending in this film and you know this gets me excited. What if it was like &quot;Dead Silence&quot;? The movie was bad with a good twist ending? Actually, the answer was vice versa: The movie was good with a great twist ending.\n\nSure, some maybe call if ridiculous and preposterous but when you&apos;re being entertained, who cares? This is a stylish techno-thriller and there are some suspenseful moments. The twists and turns work for me and so does the performances.\n\nMaybe it&apos;s another forgettable thriller, yeah. Maybe it&apos;s a preposterous, A-list cast, overwrought thriller, yes. But maybe it&apos;s an entertaining, stylish thriller which will keep your attention until the satisfying twist ending.",

The film, scripted by popular scenarist Benny P. Nayarambalam, tells the story of two brothers Appu and Achchu, the sons of Ravunni, a ballet artist. While Appu is noisy and talkative, Achchu is forced to remain silent as he is born dumb. These differences between them has resulted in hostility brewing between them and hence their father has to separate them in earlier years itself, bringing them up in two different places.\n\nAppu grows up in Pollachi, and is always ready to clench his fists and fight as and when required. He and his gang of friends are always in the middle of one boisterous activity or other. Achchu is with his father in Palakkad, as the main artist in his father&apos;s ballet troupe. He is a do-Good, always ready to help people out. The two brothers grow up as enemies, but their friends and all those around them want to see them united as loving brothers.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Beck",
      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s comedy, there&apos;s drama, and then there&apos;s rock music in a heady mix you may think it&apos;s a Masala film with all ingredients put into a melting pot and coming off deliciously entertaining. It&apos;s a story about the coming together of five individuals who share the common love for rock, and for the fictional band Dying Breed, before circumstances led them to form their own band, to create their brand of music to move the world. It&apos;s the tale about the struggle of an indie band in the cutthroat world of the music industry, where rules aren&apos;t always fair to begin with, and often experiencing being muscled out from the bigger players who live to engineer sounds like hotshot producer Ran (Shido Nakamura) responsible for rival band Belle Ame, versus those that play and create from the bottom of their hearts.\n\nFrom the tale of the individual character perspective, it&apos;s about Koyuki (Takeru Sato, almost over-utilizing his bug eyes when blindsided), an oft bullied schoolboy who finds himself learning to play the guitar under the guidance of a master (Takanori Takeyama) before teaming up with fellow schoolmate Saku (Aoi Nakamura), where both find themselves propelled into the more adult world of performing under the auspices of a real band in real gigs, rising from obscurity in school to having their own groupies, and having fellow band members protect them from incessant bullies at school. For Ryusuke (Hiro Mizushima) it&apos;s about forging a name for himself, coming from USA to Japan to do just that, breaking away from his ex-band due to his attitude and animosity, setting up some real competition. Chiba (Kenta Kiritani) the loud mouthed rapper who provides most of the comic relief as the impetuous frontman who knows a thing or two about rousing a crowd, and Taira (Osamu Mukai) the bassist modelled after Red Hot Chili Peppers&apos; Flea, completes the band BECK.\n\nMost of the subplots take us through the emotional roller coaster of the various characters, especially that of Ryusuke, Chiba and Koyuki as they deal with demons from the past, envy and worry, and romance respectively, the latter having a relationship with Ryusuke&apos;s filmmaker sister Maho (Shiori Kutsuna), who is also being pursued by rival band Belle Ame frontman, the actor turned singer Yoshito (Yuta Furukawa). While all the cast members forming BECK share some incredible chemistry as a tight outfit, these three characters and the cast playing them stand out especially, with screen time dedicated to their struggles. I would have preferred a little more insights to possibly the most mature band member in Taira, while Saku has a very fleeting romantic angle coming from an ardent BECK supporter Hiromi (Sari Kurauchi).\n\nFor its almost 2.5 hours runtime toward the ultimate goal and closure for the usual genre strategy of having to perform on the biggest stage possible, we journey with the band toward the Grateful Sound Festival which is the fictional version of the real Fuji Rock Festival, and the punchy pacing allowed for a lot of plot devices and elements getting squeezed effectively into the film, such as the dark history of Ryusuke&apos;s guitar Lucille that comes with six bullet holes in its body, jamming sessions with Blues legends, and even guitar picks become objects used to emote through music. You&apos;ll also find yourself rooting for BECK throughout, celebrating their inching toward success, and crying when pressure builds and cracks starting to appear and threatening band longevity.\n\nBut of course, what is a film about a band, if there&apos;s no rocking music to stomp your foot to? BECK provides this by the bucketloads, although of course three signature tunes of the titular band stood out, especially since we bear witness to their creation and practice sessions, primed for that all important make or break performance. There&apos;s the rock tune Evolution with Chiba in his prime, but making way quite surprisingly to Koyuki who is responsible for the slower English numbers, and here&apos;s where some may be disappointed.\n\nWe&apos;re made to believe that Koyuki, while he can&apos;t understand nor converse in English, can actually belt out English songs with plenty of heart even though he knows those lyrics by rote. And his innate ability is to move mountains and part oceans each time he opens his mouth to sing. Now this being a Japanese film, and I suppose it&apos;s quite clear that the actor Takeru Sato may not be able to confidently emote and cause audiences to break down as per those on screen, Yukihiko Tsutsumi came up with deliberately muting his voice. This may not go down well with some audiences, but I thought it was a rather creative way to allow one&apos;s imagination to run wild into how Koyuki does actually sound like when singing, and how awesome his voice would probably be judging from the supporters, and fellow band members&apos; reactions. It also played out almost like a running joke, leaving you literally begging to hear some singing voice, so I have absolutely no qualms about that.\n\nThe last film involving Japanese rock music to form a premise was Fish Story, also an excellent film that was one of my favourites in 2010. BECK belongs to the same charming vein that makes this a highly recommended film , and in my books one of the most entertaining film so far in 2011 for rock fans and non-fans alike. Clearly a favourite in my books, and a contender as one of the best. Don&apos;t miss this!",

      "reviewBody": "Try to see this film, even and especially if you are not Dutch. IN Dutch, with English subtitles. \n\nIt is the story of an eleven-year old girl who looks like a ordinary young girl, though she doesn&apos;t live in an average family. Her mother committed suicide when Desi was only 18 months old. Now she sleeps with her caring, but uninterested jobless father and his unbalanced bit of a wacko &quot;girlfriend&quot;, Desi&apos;s grandparents or her best friend, who does live in a loving harmonious family. Every time she leaves school she uses her cellphone to investigate where her next sleeping place will be tonight. \n\nThe Director is Maria Ramos. She made this documentary, winning the audience award at International Documentary Festival in Amsterdam and as kind of controversial. Though she is honest in her approach towards Desi, and makes a very loving and realistic portrait of the kid, the form she used (use of, position of the camera) made part of the audience doubt if it was a realistic one. I was absolutely moved by the documentary. Being a documentary, there is a point in doubting the chosen form. Is this a documentary? Isn&apos;t it fictionalized in a certain way? Do we care? Desi turns out to be a &quot;normal&quot; smart and caring girl, with all the basic needs she misses on the age one should not need seeking every night a new place to sleep.\n\nGO MEET DESI!!",

Other than that, it&apos;s rather ordinary, though always watchable and never boring, with story and execution more resembling a typical Hollywood western than the usual spaghetti offering. Some good action and locations are a plus.\n\nFans of Anthony Steffen and his hard-edged performances probably won&apos;t be disappointed.\n\nThough officially credited to Spanish director Leon Klimovsky, the prolific Enzo G. Castellari claims to be the real director. I tend to believe him, as his style fits the proceedings more so than Klimovsky.",

This is, of course, nonsense, as most people would not bother to finish the &quot;Worst Movie Ever&quot;; whereas, people watch &quot;The Giant Claw&quot; (and its ilk) over and over again. I&apos;d bet in 50 years people will still be snickering over the anti-matter space buzzard when, for example, &quot;Star Trek: Beyond&quot; doesn&apos;t even make it into trivia contests. How do you rate a movie that is awful by any measure but yet makes the world a better, or at least a more whimsical, place simply by existing? Metaphorically, HAL would give it a 0, Dave would give it a 10, so I&apos;ll split the difference and give it a 5.",

      "reviewBody": "I remember hearing about this film long before it came out.  Living in a small eastern Ontario town in Canada in 1982 (a town with an army base no less) I thought that as much as I wanted to, my chances of seeing this film were pretty slim unless I could somehow make it to a big city.  Finally, I lucked out and the film did come to our town as part of a double-bill along with Neil Simon&apos;s &quot;I Ought To Be In Pictures&quot;.  I remember watching as this movie (the second feature) started, and silence descended upon the entire theatre.  You could have heard a pin drop.  As the movie progressed and we got to the scene where Zack and Bart lovingly kiss for the first time there was pandemonium in the theatre.  It seemed like half the audience got up. People were yelling abusive epithets at the screen and storming out of the theatre in droves.  As a young man on the brink of committing suicide because of feelings I didn&apos;t understand and had no relation to -- this movie saved my life.  For the first time in my life, after watching this film, I could identify with someone else, and I knew there were other people like me in this world.  I thought then, and I think now, twenty-two years later, that all the people involved with this film took tremendous chances and showed great courage in seeing to it this movie was made.\n\nSay what you will about the soap opera type plot, and making the movie more palatable for mainstream tastes, the fact remains that this was in its time a ground-breaking film. I know many other people who have been profoundly touched by this film.  Several years ago I ran a group for gay men in various stages of coming out.  One night I showed them my own personal copy of this film. Nearly all who were viewing it for the first time were still totally mesmerized and awed by the courage shown by all involved with this film, particularly Harry Hamlin and Michael Ontkean. Both of these actors were already popular established actors at the time this film was made, and both of them took tremendous risks with their careers by taking these parts. For a movie to actually show two men in a loving relationship, and to actually show two men kiss each other on the lips was amazingly brave.  As was pointed out elsewhere on this board Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas would not even kiss in the &apos;critically acclaimed&apos; &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, and that was many years later. Kate Jackson was fresh off &quot;Charlie&apos;s Angels&quot; when she took the part of Claire.  Kate did a wonderful job in this film, and held her own against two powerful actors.  Her powerful speech to her husband after he comes out to her gave many women the words to say to their husbands.\n\nAll of these years later I don&apos;t think there is a finer &apos;coming out&apos; film than &quot;Making Love&quot;!",

In a move which leaves him wracked with guilt, Zach cancels dinner with his wife in order to go out with Bart. He is inexplicably drawn to this man who seems intent on keeping him at arms distance. Why can&apos;t Bart allow their relationship to grow? he wonders. Exasperated, he asks Bart, &quot;Do you snore?

Jilted by Bart and feeling alone for the first time in his married life, Zach resolves to tell Claire the truth about himself. Predictably, Claire is shocked that she could have known so little about the man she has loved for so many years and accuses him of deceiving her from the very start.",

      "name": "ultimately there&apos;s not much we can do, but it&apos;s a powerful indictment (and cool &apos;thriller&apos;) all the same",
      "reviewBody": "The Cove is kind of a hybrid of environmental/animal-rights polemic and a thriller in the mold of a heist movie, only more along the lines of Inception: instead of taking something out, these people (camera technician wizards from ILM) are putting something in. In this case it&apos;s at a cove in a small village, Taijii, where fishermen are (somewhat not so) secretly killing dolphins en masse, and the cameramen are after a simple thing: put believably disguised rocks that have cameras inside that can film outward and capture on tape what is going on, due to the strict lack of access during the day. We get the background on Richard O&apos;Barry, the original trainer of Flipper, and how he spent thirty years of his life after the first ten of working for dolphin training trying to redeem himself for what he&apos;s seen as horrific, inexcusable negligence of dolphins. I mean, after all, they can commit suicide for Pete&apos;s sake.\n\nThe segments with O&apos;Barry, and the delving deep into the world of dolphin abuse and their captivity around the world, but most of all the sort of unspoken horror that goes on at the cove of Taijii, are fascinating and moving. And we get a good point of view into how O&apos;Barry operates in this small village (he has to, for one, always have on a mask over his mouth as he drives to not attract attention as a non- Japanese non-fisherman). He is notorious, but his points are almost all valid. His conviction is so strong that it almost competes to take over what is, arguably, even more fascinating: how he gets together a group of tech-savvy people and divers and so on to make these cameras and do whatever it takes to plant them at the cove. \n\nIf the film possibly gets off track at any time it&apos;s just one or two minor places, like a diversion into the fishing industry and how it ties in with the dolphin saga (it just barely does, mostly by proxy of it being one of Japan&apos;s economic mainstays). But this is so minor a point that it&apos;s forgivable. What puts The Cove over the top as a must-see is the merging of the passionate subject matter with the purpose of artistry in the filmmaking. Perhaps by accident, the images of the climax of the film are staggering: the red of the blood of the dolphins pouring out into the water, it overtaking all of the blue of the ocean, and the harsh, Japanese-violent images of dolphin slaughter. It&apos;s like we&apos;re witness to a massacre that has a haunting beauty to it because of the juxtaposition of colors and how the cameras capture it. In the more conventional sense, there are also those wonderful scenes showing the film crew at night, in dim light and infra-green, sneaking around and freezing at the slightest sound or figure, even if it&apos;s a marmot.\n\nThe film provides a shocking topic that will get people talking, which is important, but it also needs to be a well-directed and told film, which it also is. The message is clear- so clear some may contest how truthful everything in the movie is, though it&apos;s hard for me to see what would be obfuscated all things considered (i.e. an Oceanic Preservation Society Production)- and film buffs looking for a strikingly shot documentary, with glorious images of dolphins at sea and their personalities (yes, personalities) shining through, will be excited.",

      "reviewBody": "I recently took a class about India in college and towards the end of the semester, we watched a few clips from some Bollywood and Tamil movies. I was very moved and inspired by the clips alone! Then, I told my friend (who happens to be Indian) from my work study job that I like Bollywood. So she invited me to an &quot;Indian Movie Night&quot; at her dorm. We watched K3G and I was so touched by it! It was simply wonderful. Most of all, I became a SRK and Kajol fan. Their on-screen chemistry is remarkable! I can&apos;t explain it! Anyhoo, I asked my mom for some Bollywood movies for Christmas and one of the movies I got was DDLJ. And let me tell ya&apos;ll, it is now my favorite movie of all time. SRK and Kajol shine beyond reason in this flick. The script is excellent, everything is excellent especially the acting and memorable songs! The supporting cast (most notably Simran parents, sister and Raj&apos;s dad were figging awesome!) Mr. Amish (sic) Puri, who played Kajol&apos;s dad acts wonderfully with just his eyes! One of the funniest lines in the movie is when Raj&apos;s friend walks into Simran&apos;s dad store and says &quot;Uncle, can I have some beer?!&quot; Gosh, it&apos;s the way that cat said the line that made it so FUNNY! After watching it again yesterday, I realized that I love so many Hollywood movies (particularly classic ones) and yet I couldn&apos;t state my all time favorite one. But while watching the making of DDLJ (I own the special edition version with two DVD&apos;s inside), I became rather teary eyed. I mean, I&apos;m getting teary eyed writing this review at this moment! This film touched not only my heart, but my soul as well. They are so many underlying messages in DDLJ that can strike a cord in a non-Indian&apos;s (like me, I&apos;m Nigerian American) soul. In end, I hope people who read this will buy DDLJ, (Renting will be useless, because you&apos;ll want to watch it over and over again...) love this priceless gem of a movie, and this goes out to the girls, wanna &quot;come...fall in love&quot; with a cool, crazy, sexy guy like Raj!\n\nPS- THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!",

Levine and Englund are both over-the-top and captivating, the plot, script and score are simple and stupid, but in a way that renders them unimportant. Just invite some buds over, get some beer and laugh as Robert Englund hobbles around cursing, Ted Levine pops pills and the machine folds people like sheets. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s really bad and, at times confusing. But, while Tobe Hooper may have dropped the ball on this, he never kicks it out of the court. If you&apos;re looking for stupid fun, this is pretty solid.",

The actors all feel like actors, not a bunch of film students trying to act. No academy award performances, but no &quot;so over the top you crinch&quot; moments, either. The movie keeps a good sense of humor through-out. Plenty of blood (and to humorous levels at times). Effects are nicely done. Nector Rose as Delia is an absolute JOY - easily stealing the show (and there&apos;s a GREAT topless scene with her). Tiffany Shepis as Marsha spends most of the movie in Spandex - looking great for an actor described in her bio as &quot;voluptuous.&quot; Best of all, after spending all that time tracing her curves through that skin-tight costume, the viewer is rewarded with a nice shot of her without the costume.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that keeps me watching cheesy horror flicks!",

      "reviewBody": "Leslie Nielsen is truly the grandmaster of slapstick comedies. In the new film &quot;Wrongfully Accused,&quot; Nielsen once more proves that he is capable of saving a bad spoof from being bad. In it, he releases his natural talent of comic genius into his character similar to the one from the magnificent movie &quot;The Fugitive&quot;(Harrison Ford) and, of course, makes us laugh up a storm.\n\nLeslie Nielsen is surprisingly energetic in this film, more than usual. I mean, it&apos;s not like him to do some of the things he does in this production. Then again, this is not your typical Nielsen movie in any means. The plot is awfully serious for a slapstick and the characters are too complicated. In a drama movie these things are all signs of skill, but for a movie that just wants to have fun, these things are flaws. Nielsen saves the production by doing what he can with the script.\n\nAnother problem of the film is that it virtually strained for laughs, to the point of  making the audience think before they laugh. For example, the accused murder walks into a town labeled &quot;The Town That Has More Police Than Anywhere in the Whole Wide World.&quot;\n\nThere are some quickie jokes that do work, for instance: In a hospital, the intercom speaker says &quot;Dr. Kavorkian to Mr. Simson&apos;s room.&quot; Or how about when Ryan looks over Lake&apos;s photo album under the family tree, the father has two branches, her dad and Bill Clinton. The funniest: When Harrison makes the jump from the dam, from &quot;Fugitive&quot; you here the title song from &quot;Baywatch&quot; and see a group of attractive young lifeguards race to site. The US marshals shoot machine guns at the criminals&apos; feet making them do an Irish dance.\n\n&quot;Wrongfully Accused&quot; is the summer&apos;s second spoof movie. First along came the lame &quot;Mafia,&quot; which didn&apos;t work because there were no main characters. To have Leslie Nielsen on your team when you&apos;re making a spoof, that&apos;s an almost certain success even if the film on its own is bad, like this movie. In other words, if this movie was absent of him and was still released in theaters it should have been called &quot;Wrongfully Released.&quot;"

Yes this movie does owe something to the slapstick routines of those two gentlemen yet it has a life of it&apos;s own which in many ways far surpasses slapstick. For those people who can only see the sight gags then this movie will only provide mild appeal. Look deeper and appreciate the marvellous comedic talents of  Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Peter Falk, Keenan Wynn and Natalie Wood.\n\nComedy is always a thing of personal taste. I suspect that there will be those who will rave about how wonderful The Great Race is while others will call it a waste of time and money. There will be few in the middle ground. I fall into the rave category. To me this movie is sheer FUN.\n\nThe visuals are splendid and awesomly huge. The costumes fabulous and the location settings vast. Everything is over the top, yet there is still room for small subtleties and in-jokes. The actors have a ball. Jack Lemmon just sneaks in as the best scene stealer but the able cast hold their own too. The Great Race just cries out for a restoration job and a release on DVD - please !",

After a sentimental crisis and a nervous breakdown, she discovers a new life and spirit in an institute of mental illnesses... I really liked this movie, and I think that the reason is quite simple: the director, Laurence Ferreira Barbosa, fully succeeded in depicting folly without any sociological schematism and with uncommon freedom. But I can&apos;t forget to mention the astonishing performance by Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, whose destiny (I hope) is definitely bright. Finally, just an advice: go and see it if you like Cesaria Evora. This fantastic singer gives us two unforgettable moments of authentic joy with her brilliant voice.",

Which he is falsely accused of planning a violent jailbreak. Now the whole city is on his trail and the only one, who could clear his name is an ambitious television reporter James Russell (Charlie Sheen). Which is the only reason why Franklin was sent to prison, because of James. Now together, they find each other mixed-up with cops, crooks and euro-trash bad guys. Which Franklin knows that the man (Gerard Ismael) was chained-up with in the bus. He was trying to retrieve a fortune in diamonds.\n\nDirected by Brett Rather (Rush Hour Trilogy, X-Men 3:The Last Stand, Red Dragon) made an highly entertaining comedy with enough thrills and humour. Although the premise is familiar but Tucker&apos;s energetic comical performance makes this worth watching.\n\nDVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan &amp; Scan) and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes the original theatrical trailer, cast information and star highlights by Tucker and Sheen. After the box office success of this film, Tucker went on the one of the leads of the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; movies. Paul Sorvino is amusingly cast as Russell&apos;s future father-in-law. Written by Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow. Which they wrote films together like &quot;Garfield&quot;, &quot;Garfield:A Tale of Two Kitties&quot; and &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Tucker also executive produced the film. Super 35. (****/*****).",

      "reviewBody": "I just finished watching Tuya&apos;s marriage at the Berlin Film Festival and would rate it 8/10. The movie deals with a herder woman in Inner Mongolia who decides to divorce because her husband is sick and unable to care for her and the family. Since she still loves him, any prospective new husband must promise to care for her and the kids as well as for her old husband.\n\nThe plot may sound a bit constructed, but it actually works remarkably well. The pictures are great, and after D. Byambasuren&apos;s rather static movies this is finally a drama set in the steppes. The most important thing is probably that the movie takes its subjects seriously. Maybe a bit too seriously at times, but not that seriously that it disturbs the movie.\n\nSo, why not giving it 10/10? I missed the Mongolian language. Of course language isn&apos;t everything (see Mongolian Pingpong or Apocalypto), but when even the drinking habits are dealt with in greatest detail, why didn&apos;t they bother to find a cast that can speak Mongolian? I asked the director about why they used Chinese (that&apos;s what you go on film festivals for), but his answer was not really convincing. I suppose some opportunistic reason, like the main actress can&apos;t speak Mongolian. Anyway, this only means that you can as well enjoy this movie in a dubbed version.\n\nIn short: Definitely recommended.",

The dialogue is first rate with some really memorable oneliners, some scenes are incredibly funny, others touching and emotional, a really exceptional mix of moods and feelings. For me this is one of the few German movies that was really worth going to the movie theatre for. Justus Dohnanyi gives an amazing performance as the German &quot;Schmaltz&quot; popstar Bruce Berger, who sings these horrible, sappy songs about saving the earth. His scenes are sensationally funny, but also equally tragic and i hope this guy wins some award for his crazy performance here. But all the other actors were outstanding too, their timing is right on the money and even though some scenes are rather over the top, the acting isn&apos;t. I have never seen Til Schweiger, the German megastar, as good as in this movie.",

Obviously many who have voted have not posted a review. Equally obviously, to offset its many detractors...a significant number of people must have liked it. I&apos;m one of them! \n\nLet us agree immediately, anyone looking for a sequel to THE GUNS OF NAVARONE can expect to be disappointed. A screen adaptation of John Katzenbach&apos;s excellent novel, this late WW2 flick tackles racism, POW life and honor...and not necessarily in that order. A re-hash of the plot is unnecessary as every second reviewer has covered this aspect. It is a film to LISTEN to and to take from it what you are able. Negative comments such that the events portrayed are &quot;unlikely,&quot; that Bruce Willis isn&apos;t the &quot;star,&quot; that &quot;nothing happens except lots of people keep talking,&quot; are a sad indictment of viewers with a limited attention span. A lot of what is uttered during the &quot;court-room&quot; sequences has great relevance in all facets of life - IF you care to listen. Farrell is excellent as is Willis in what admittedly IS a far smaller role. Willis&apos; presence however is felt throughout the movie in much the same way as was Jack Nicholson&apos;s in A FEW GOOD MEN. (Another military court room flick)\n\nYes its longish and it would be fair to say it is extremely dark for the greater part of the film. It is ultimately though a worthwhile addition to other POW films. You could do a lot worse."

The dialogs are just awful, the German synchronization makes it no better (some of the speaker shouldn&apos;t be allowed to talk in front of a mic (or at all)). I&apos;ve never seen such a lame movie, not even a b-movie. God, I&apos;ve seen movies made with NO BUDGET AT ALL that are much better. The story could be told in three sentences, but it&apos;s not worth the effort. The special effect (not effects, just one) could&apos;ve been done better by a 9 year old using photoshop and the performance of the actors would be embarrassing even for bad lay-actors. AND it&apos;s not even funny.\n\nThere is not one positive thing to say about this movie. Nothing, nada, nichts!\n\nTo make a worse movie than this would be really challenging.\n\nConclusion: This movie is SO bad, it probably makes a good torture device.\n\nSorry if you think I&apos;m ranting, but I&apos;m only being honest. Take my advice: Don&apos;t waste your time with this movie, it&apos;s a miracle someone published it on DVD.",

As has been pointed out in previous posts, this movie has a somewhat loose and highly implausible script but you find yourself saying &quot;Who cares?&quot; while shooting milk (or insert beverage of your choice here) through your nose. It was indeed due to a rare mix of actors in sync. While Kelsey Grammar is obviously a gifted actor (reference &apos;Frasier&apos;, this movie) the supporting actors/actress play their roles quite well. I found in interesting how they threw in the part about Duane Martin blowing the shot in the &apos;big game&apos; for Navy&apos;s basketball team; if any of you is a basketball fan you&apos;ll remember Martin from &apos;White Men Can&apos;t Jump&apos; and &apos;Above the Rim&apos; and you&apos;ll know that Martin had a short stint in the NBA with the Knicks. Nice how they threw in believable character attributes such as this. Rob Schneider&apos;s anal-retentive character was the perfect offset to Grammar&apos;s calm demeanor. Lauren Holly played the gutsy-sexpot-with-a-brain well enough to make you want her to succeed. This is a movie that will make you laugh even if you&apos;ve seen it many times before...the comic bits in this movie definitely last. I still find myself laughing 12 years later.\n\n&quot;Is that one of my chickens?&quot; &quot;Uhhh...no. This a parrot....from the Caribbean.&quot; &quot;Well don&apos;t let it fly away...that&apos;s supper.&quot; &quot;Arrrrr.....arr.&quot;",

He wins the villain&apos;s financée, even if our hero&apos;s grey haired mum, second billed von Bukovics, flies in, which might have spooked most potential romances.\n\nGood pacing, and a breezy performance by our hero to go with accomplished, smallish scale production. Albers&apos; adventure films are an unexpected element of the thirties scene - complete with the approval they give the US Consul etc."

      "reviewBody": "The original &apos;Kisarazu Cat&apos;s Eye&apos;, I gather, was a TV series about a baseball team,one of whose members had cancer and had just six months to live.\n\nThis film is set three years after his death and, despite the above description, is a comedy. One of the teammates hears voices, telling him: &quot;If you build it, he will come.&quot; He therefore reunites with his ex-teammates to try and carry out what he supposes to be his ex-team-mate&apos;s wishes. First they try building a massage parlour, but that is not what the mysterious voice requires, so they try building a Starbucks coffee-house before eventually trying a baseball pitch. At this point zombies turn up and the film gets really crazy.\n\nAt first I thought I was only going to be giving it three stars but as the film went on, I began to enjoy it more and more. It is quite surreal and extremely funny in places. It is very confusing, with constant flash-backs, but not knowing the original series was not a serious hindrance to enjoying it. It was fast-paced and enjoyable, although the baseball game in the final section dragged on a bit.\n\nThe film lasts 132 minutes and I obtained my Region 1 DVD from Amazon.com. The subtitles are good. (At the start of the film, I was concerned as the English subtitles appeared on top of burnt-in Japanese subtitles which did not appear to make much sense. But then the camera pulled back to reveal the characters were watching a Korean TV drama and the burnt-in subtitles stopped.) \n\nI bought the film as Chiaki Kuriyama is my favourite actress but, unfortunately, she only provides a very brief cameo. She plays a very tough army trainer (Yes, really!!!) in a military camp and is absolutely brilliant in her few minutes of screen time.\n\nIf I was asked to choose something it was similar in tone to, I would say the old Australian TV series: &apos;Round the Twist&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "Try and forget for a second that this film only got released in 1979! Personally, I&apos;m 100% convinced that it was, in fact, George Lucas who totally ripped off this brilliantly plotted script and even shamelessly copied the costume designs and set pieces of this genuine Sci-Fi milestone to make his own insignificant and overrated – but perhaps slightly better marketed – &quot;Star Wars&quot;! Seriously, THIS should have been the Sci-Fi hype of the past century! This should have been the film that spawned numerous sequels, imitations, merchandising and millions of obsessive and nerdy fan-boys all over the world, damned! \n\nOf all the blatant rip-off&apos;s that the Italians made during the late 70&apos;s/early 80&apos;s period – and the amount of them is really gigantic – &quot;The Humanoid&quot; is most likely the most blatant of them all. The intro scrolling over the screen at the beginning, the main villain wearing exactly the same helmet as Darth Vader (though with an S&amp;M mask underneath) and the robot is R2D2 with a doggie makeover. Thank God they didn&apos;t do an imitation of C3PO! The Han Solo on duty is Richard &quot;Jaws&quot; Kiel and it&apos;s immediately stated clear why this guy should only play roles that are completely silent. Cult siren Barbara Bach plays an evil queen who needs the blood of young women to safeguard her beauty (nice little Countess Bathory sub plot, actually). She allies with Darth Vader number two and with an evil professor who&apos;s working on a new and indestructible type of cyber-warrior called The Humanoid. Who other than Richard Kiel would be the more ideal Humanoid prototype, so thus the evil threesome turn Golob&apos;s (that&apos;s his name) spaceship into confetti and he emerges from the lake again as their retarded minion. With his superhuman strength, Darth Vader number two can finally conquer the throne of Metropolis. How about that plot, huh? Actually, I&apos;m not quite sure if my little summary is fully accurate, as I was too busy laughing most of the time. &quot;The Humanoid&quot; truly is God-awful but immeasurably entertaining exploitation trash that you simply cannot hate. The funniest thing is that this idiocy was actually made by an ensemble of people that should know better, like director Aldo Lado (&quot;Who Can Kill a Child&quot;), special effects supervisor Antonio Margheriti (&quot;The Virgin of Nuremberg&quot;), composer Ennio Morricone (&quot;Once Upon a time in the West&quot;), writer Adriano Bolzoni (&quot;Your Vice is a Locked Room and only I have the Key&quot;) and lead actress Barbara Bach (&quot;The Spy who Loved Me&quot;). The special effects and costumes are tacky from the beginning, but the plot gradually grows even more imbecilic as we move along. The variant on the lightsabers are  lightarrows! The entire special effects team must have brainwashed for two whole days over the question: what other medieval piece of armory can we turn into a futuristic fantasy weapon without George Lucas suing us? &quot;The Humanoid&quot; is the purest form of entertainment, especially if you have the chance of watching it with some fellow trash fanatics and whilst under the influence of mild narcotics.",

Foxx is the head of the bureau&apos;s Rapid Action team; accompanied by fellow agents Cooper (an explosives expert), and Garner (a forensic specialist), he leads an &quot;unofficial&quot; expedition to the site to try and seek out the guilty party. Political thriller has a realistic setup and three capable leads, but unfortunately the film rambles, and reduces itself to a revenge flick on its way to an action-packed climax that feels desperately contrived. The story is interesting but never convincing, especially the ending which is hollow and sentimental. **"

I have never witnessed worse acting all around as real-life couple Brandi Sherwood and Dean Cochran (how are those for porn names?) scrape the very bottom of the acting barrel to great comedic effect.\n\nA summary of the plot is quite unnecessary, as it is really a horrible Jaws pastiche- think greedy mayor, disgruntled but ever-hopeful hero guy trying to protect his family and add a goofy subplot involving predictably nefarious Russian diamond-hunters and you get the idea. The film is basically a composite of pre-recorded shark footage from the Discovery Channel (in fact, most of these scenes are played SEVERAL times within a few minutes) meshed with fake looking death scenes. And oh, are there a lot of death scenes. I&apos;ve never seen a higher body count in a shark movie, and I have made an effort to see as many as possible. Definitely a case of quantity reigning victorious over any semblance of quality, but I digress.\n\nA more warranted review of this movie would detail the numerously ridiculous and consequently wonderful mistakes:\n\nWagner, a so-called shark expert, informs the mayor that these pesky sharks are related to the Jurassic sharks of 50 million years ago. News flash: The Jurassic period ended 145 million years ago.\n\nSharks do not growl.\n\nIt is rare to see Great Whites together, but I&apos;ll be damned if they aren&apos;t chilling with their bros all up in this Shark Zone in about every sequence.\n\nDuring several of the attack scenes, you can see the flesh of some animal used as bait tied to a fishing line. Well, gee, no wonder Wagner is only batting about .010 in terms of saving the many hapless victims. I guess all of the budget was spent on erasing the Discovery Channel logo from the footage.\n\nThe final shark scene in the pool features a SURFBOARD with a shark painted on the bottom.\n\nHow could a Spanish ship crossing the Atlantic ocean sink in the Pacific outside of San Francisco? Must have been one hell of a storm.\n\nDuring Wagner&apos;s dream, his wife is dragged out of the boat by a shark that has crashed through the bottom. She is dragged into the water but somehow manages to splash and drip water from her submerged hands and arms.\n\nOverall, my feelings about this movie are mixed. While it offers countless thrills in terms of sheer laughable entertainment, the truly scrate-awful acting and egregious errors render it nothing short of the worst movie ever made.",

      "reviewBody": "The movie starts with the setup we&apos;ve all seen a billion times before: Some guys. Are annoying. Horny. Some girls. Are annoying. Horny. Have party. Drink. Try to sex. Good times. Then suddenly... an earthquake!\n\nThe tone shifts drastically and the world around them goes to hell in a hand-basket real quick. Decimated architecture, riots in the streets, prisoners escaping, warnings of an incoming tsunami, every man for himself, and no one is safe. Anyone can meet their untimely end when you least expect it, just like a real life disaster.\n\nThis may sound like an intense and nihilistic experience, but beneath the surface, the film sticks to the usual horror movie rules and holds back too much to be a truly effective shocker. In other words, it feels too &quot;Hollywoodized&quot;. There&apos;s also a dumb twist towards the end. Even still, there&apos;s just enough carnage here to satisfy undemanding lovers of cinematic slime. A natural disaster movie that puts most of it&apos;s focus on animalistic human behavior rather than the flashy special effects could, and should, have been a lot better.",

Most of the film is an old-fashioned, disjointed soap opera; only near the end are there a few meager suspense sequences. Jodie Foster is fine, and the film definitely gets a shot in the arm from Sam Neill when he enters the picture in the second half. But it&apos;s still one of Chabrol&apos;s least interesting films. Overlong, too. ** out of 4.",

This film had me riveted!  I felt as though I was invited to eavesdrop, peek in on a great master at work.  Every brush stroke was fascinating.  I enjoyed the trip Picasso took me on as he started out painting one image and changed it into something else along the way.  I enjoyed watching what appeared to be random brush strokes turn into a completed thought. This film helped me feel what it must be like to know when to stop... to know when you have finished a work... when you may have overworked it, when you may not have quite completed. It made me want to paint, not for others but for the simple pleasure one gets from the act of putting pigment on paper.  It allowed me to feel free to create without fear of criticism.

      "reviewBody": "When BAD TIMING: A SENSUAL OBSESSION emerged in 1980, its distributor dropped it like a hot potato. Sex! Surgery! Semen stains! Strippers rolling around on meshy overwire! It was all too much for the Rank Organization, a fading production empire with a long history of releasing family classics like GREAT EXPECTATIONS. (Curiously, Rank did sponsor a &apos;Win a trip to Vienna, location of BAD TIMING!&apos; publicity contest at early bookings). The only reason they financed the picture, allegedly, was for its Freudian-tinged pedigree. When they saw the finished product, they labeled it &apos;a film about sick people, made by sick people, for sick people.&apos;\n\nDeviant psychology is but one of the many twisted pleasures in this tragically neglected masterpiece from &apos;70s visionary Nicolas Roeg. With iconoclastic films like WALKABOUT, DON&apos;T LOOK NOW and MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH, Roeg pioneered a new kind of film language. He replaced traditional narrative storytelling with stunning photography, explicit carnality and a signature editing style of jump cuts, cross cuts and subliminal flicker cuts Mixmastered into a mosaic of multiple interpretations. (Unlike today&apos;s A.D.D.-inducing overkill, Roeg&apos;s fragmentary cutting technique always provided insight into character psychology.) To those of us weaned on art cinema in the &apos;70s and energized by the limitless possibilities of the medium, Nicolas Roeg was (and remains) a god. No filmmaker since has picked up the maverick torch that this deity carried for more than a decade.\n\nTrying to encapsulate BAD TIMING&apos;s nuanced, character-driven plot is like describing Europe in a postcard. Essentially, it&apos;s about an eroticized interpersonal attraction that goes horribly awry, spiraling into jealousy, paranoia and (of course) sexual obsession. Theresa Russell&apos;s wild child Milena (the personification of Henry James&apos; headstrong American girl abroad) is compulsively drawn to a fellow Yank stationed in Austria -- the buttoned-down, Freudian shrink/visiting prof Dr. Linden. Their passionate affair has led to a potentially tragic outcome, and it&apos;s up to a local police inspector (Harvey Keitel) to sort out what went wrong, why, and whether criminal malice was involved.\n\nWhat makes this relationship drama so compelling is Roeg&apos;s structure: the film starts in the middle, jumps ahead to the end, then back to the prologue within the first four minutes  and continues in a non-linear fashion until the final shot. It takes us viewers a while to get our bearing, but it also elicits our rapt attention to detail. Never are we certain if the cascading flashbacks are meant to be objective on the filmmaker&apos;s part, or the skewed perspective of one of the three main characters. Is Russell a victim, or a tramp? Is Garfunkel a creep, or is that just Keitel&apos;s projection? Is Keitel a sympathetic doppelganger, or a crafty manipulator? The stars turn in complex, though off-center performances. Keitel turns miscasting to his advantage; never has he underplayed &apos;menacing&apos; like he does here. Garfunkel&apos;s lack of charisma will turn many viewers off, but he&apos;s 100% believable as a shrewd, unstable shrink. Yet it&apos;s Russell who&apos;s the revelation  those who subscribe to the lazy theory that she can&apos;t act will be astonished here. What she may lack in formal technique, she compensates with fearless commitment. Hers may be the most passionate performance by a 21-year old ever captured on film.\n\nTony Richmond&apos;s widescreen photography is particularly rich in color and composition (the film&apos;s look was based on the art of Gustav Klimt). He shows us a Vienna that&apos;s cold, academic, clinical  but electric whenever Russell&apos;s on screen. There&apos;s a sequence in a university courtyard where he changes lenses, practically from shot to shot, to convey Russell&apos;s emotional collapse. (In the background, Keith Jarrett&apos;s &apos;Köln Concert&apos; mourns her sad dilemma.) It&apos;s a heartbreaking passage, poetically surpassed only by the connecting shot of Garfunkel brooding through a polarized car windshield at daybreak. Frequently Richmond balances the stars&apos; close-ups on the very edge of the screen, which is why the film&apos;s power is neutered on cable TV, where 2/3 of the image is lopped off. In that pan-and-scan atrocity, the screen is forever hovering on backgrounds and earlobes.\n\nThe real tragedy is that BAD TIMING has never been released on any home video format, and I fear it may never happen. It was made at a time when music licenses weren&apos;t automatically cleared for home viewing. Considering the eclectic soundtrack incorporates Jarrett, Tom Waits, The Who, Billie Holiday, Harry Partch and others, the idea of renegotiating deals at this point would be any lawyer&apos;s nightmare. Even worse, Roeg himself believes the few prints that Rank struck are probably lost or damaged beyond repair, and one fears for the state of the negative. My overlong, effusive review here is a direct plea for a rescue operation. Is any entrepreneurial DVD-releasing outfit willing to salvage this forgotten treasure from obscurity and give it the best letterboxed release possible? Once people are able to see this film as it was intended  for the first time in 24 years or more  I believe its reputation will grow immeasurably. There is simply no other film like it, and, based on current popular trends, nor will there ever be.",

If you are reading this now and haven&apos;t yet seen the trailer, I would recommend you don&apos;t watch the trailer and just go straight to the film, Some of the best parts are shown in the trailer. To watch this film you don&apos;t really need to have seen the first however I would recommend you do as at points the film refers to Despicable Me (1).\n\nI&apos;m going to keep this review short and simply say, I gave this film a 9* rating as I found it strongly entertaining, not as funny as I thought but still a great film! The story line was also very easy to follow and keeps you engaged throughout.\n\nWould recommend this film to anyone! I would say most people will enjoy this film, find it entertaining and recommend it to there friends! \n\nThis film is perfect for any family to view!",

So a while ago I started digging into his older films in search of more comedic gold.\n\nI hit a few bumps along the way with films like Faithfully Yours, My Hero and Love Is Love, mainly because they failed to demonstrate the true talent of Stephen Chow and other cast members as a whole. Just when I was about to find an excuse and proclaim Chow as an untapped talent, I came upon Curry &amp; Pepper.\n\nAlthough it shies away from his later established, fantasy-comedy sequences, it provides handful of fast spoken gags. I wouldn&apos;t go as far as to say that Chow and Cheung had the greatest chemistry in the history of buddy-cop movies (not like many others have anyway), but they had enough focus to effortlessly deliver their goods over and over again. Chow tries to come off as a hard-boiled, bullet loving cop with a short temper, while Cheung does a fine job playing a soft-spoken ladies man with similar to Chow&apos;s tendencies. Their conflict of interest is over Ann Bridgewater who really doesn&apos;t do much except look good and proper.\n\nThe end result is satisfying and this movie manages to become one of Chow&apos;s best offerings from the late 80&apos;s to early 90&apos;s era. What ultimately helps this film is that not too many characters are crammed into the story and the routine that Curry &amp; Pepper perform as a two-man-show simply works.",

I mean, why would you make a movie with amateur actors and actresses? Beyond reason. There is no chemistry between the characters, and the situations between them look very cartoonish.\n\nThe direction is the main problem in this movie. If you are going to make a &quot;scary&quot; movie then you should do the correct mix between colors and dark. This movie is dark in the wrong sense. You can&apos;t clearly see what&apos;s happening because of the horrible cinematography and lightning. Also, the editing is painful.\n\nThis movie has no scare factor or even a decent plot. Just avoid it please."

      "reviewBody": "A young impoverished couple (Tom Keene, Karen Morley) with no employment is given some land and a farm by an uncle during the Depression.The couple finds hardships on their way and they&apos;ll have to fight against distress, elements, and drought. They are helped by some hapless people (John Qualen and many others) and success in managing the land, creating a socialist community . They find hardships as the struggle to support themselves. As they struggle to maintain their dignity and pride and the enjoyable community is peppered with some happy moments, Meanwhile a cover-girl (Pepper) is tempting to the protagonist John.\n\nThis is a naturalist rural drama magnificently performed and splendidly staged. This look at day-to-day existence of a poor-class couple is a superb naturalistic celebration of fighting to survive amid all the disgraces, and drought. Its best scenes are referred when the workers are commonly digging the land and water running through the furrows. It contains with numerous sequences highly influenced by Russian directors, such as Alexander Dovshenko and Sergei Eisenstein. Interesting screenplay by King Vidor, risking bankruptcy to finance it, furthermore clever dialogs by the great director Joseph L Mankiewicz. It was a deserved critical success for its sincere treatment of sentiments and its thrillingly slick edition, and innovative utilization of mobile camera. Neo-realist and evocative photography by Robert Planck. Sensible and imaginative musical score by the classic Alfred Newman.\n\nThe picture is originally directed by King Vidor. After his successful ¨The last parade¨ one of the great war films of the silent era, he directed ¨The crowed(1928)¨, one of the best mute motion pictures, that is a precedent to ¨Our daily bread¨ and concerning about a working-class people against the backdrop of wealthy society. Later on, Vidor explored similar theme in ¨Street impact¨and he went on filming successful movies such as ¨Duel in the sun (46)¨, ¨Fountainhead(49), ¨Ruby Gentry¨ terminating with blockbusters as ¨War and Peace¨and ¨Solomon and Sheba¨. Rating : Better than average. This sentimental and religious film appeal to uncharacteristic Hollywood epic buffs.",

In the movie Steve and Doug dont even look like brothers but they sure act like it. I love how they do slow moving shots. makes you laugh and wanna watch at the same time wondering what is going to happen. One of the best parts of this movie are the lines, like did you grass my butt, or you outta town you new, aiight. There are plenty of them in the movie and i even use them in everyday life cause its just funny. This movie should be ranked higher in the imdb. In my opinion i give it a 10 rating."

      "reviewBody": "I have been aware of this film for many, many years now. Yet I always used to forget it existed when I thought of Dario Argento&apos;s filmography. I guess he is such an auteur that it seemed really bizarre that he would direct a historical comedy. Having said that, he did seem to have a penchant for including comedy into most of his gialli and horror films. But with the odd exceptions such as the comic interplay between David Hemmings and Daria Nicolodi in Deep Red, I have to say that his attempts at humour always seemed really clunky. So for this reason, I never really made any attempt to seek The Five Days of Milan out. As it turned out, a fellow IMDb user kindly sorted me out a copy of the film and I was finally able to check it out for myself.\n\nDuring the final days of the Italian revolution a thief escapes from jail in the chaos. He hooks up with a baker and they travel the streets of Milan together witnessing the historic events. Unfortunately, the idealism of the revolution quickly turns to hypocrisy, rape and murder.\n\nAs it turned out this was Argento&apos;s only film to move away from the giallo/horror genres. It wasn&apos;t successful seemingly but it isn&apos;t necessarily difficult to understand why. It has a wildly varying tone that veers from slapstick to brutal rape. This must&apos;ve been quite disconcerting for many at the time. The comedy isn&apos;t particularly funny to be perfectly honest; although this didn&apos;t really surprise me too much given my experience with Argento&apos;s other films. But the more sober and serious material is quite effectively handled at times. And the film does seem to have pretty decent production values and does look pretty good as well. Argento&apos;s stylistic approach is massively reduced to fit the period film aesthetics, which is a shame in some ways but probably sensible overall. It&apos;s a movie that has very Italian specific subject matter and was no doubt only ever conceived of serving the domestic market, so from a non-Italian&apos;s point-of-view it doesn&apos;t fully make a connection at times. Nevertheless, I have to say that it was a movie that I found more rewarding and interesting than I ever thought I would.",

However, if you&apos;re not a young child, then this movie probably won&apos;t be that awesome to you. The animation in this movie isn&apos;t very good; it&apos;s kind of choppy, and the two girls in it will take five seconds just to blink. The walk cycles are really weird, too. And yes, that big hairball on the movie poster is the &quot;Sasquatch.&quot; The voice acting in this movie wasn&apos;t pulled off very well either; the voice actors of the main characters especially don&apos;t really have any expression in their voices. They just sound like they&apos;re reading a script. William Hurt voices the girls&apos; father, and he whispers and speaks softly at inappropriate times. Yeah, I can&apos;t believe this is an actual movie. It looks more like a film by a college/animation student. I only gave this movie a two rather than a one because as terrible as this movie is, they somehow got award-winning actors like William Hurt, June Foray, and John Rhys-Davies to voice-act.",

Why does no one seem concerned about radiation? Why does no one have guns? Why do some people have super powers like Ryu or Ken on Street Fighter? Why the hell are there American white and black people being ninjas&gt; \n\nI hope this movie was made by film students because the acting and dialogue was what I would expect from a bunch of college bums. \n\nI suppose we should all just take the movie for what it is.....a Saturday morning cereal crunching, brain numbing, action flick. I think the creators had vision ...........the vision of a 12 year old boy interpretation of what ninjas should be like - a cross between Mortal Kombat, Tekken and Tenchu Stealth Assassin (now there&apos;s a cool PlayStation game!!!)",

Rather, it&apos;s an emotional love story that will make you laugh and cry at the same time and really pull at your heartstrings, like only a classic Korean romantic film knows how to do. I watched this at my local theater, and almost everyone cried at some point during the movie--most of the girls were bawling towards the end and I noticed that even many of the guys were crying (including some middle-aged men!). If you&apos;re going to see this movie, I highly recommend taking some tissues with you.",

The studio (Warner Brothers) and producer (Darryl Zanuck) caved to pressure from the Catholic Legion of Decency and altered the ending in order to provide a morally-correct resolution for the main characters (and audience).\n\nIt would certainly be interesting to see a director&apos;s cut of this film, or at least a shooting script to get a better idea of what Cukor and Zanuck intended. Probably Zanuck&apos;s goal was to create a film where people more openly discussed sex. However, America was not quite ready to do that yet in 1962, and with the Legion of Decency hovering over the scene, it would be nearly impossible. \n\nI do think there are some excellent performances in this film, namely Glynis Johns and Claire Bloom who prove that British actresses often surpass their North American counterparts."

      "name": "Fulci Hits Another Home Run",
      "reviewBody": "Quella Villa Accanto al Cimitero/House by the Cemetery(1981) is the first straight forward film for Fulci since Zombie Flesh Eaters(1979).  Gets away from the dreamish themematics of his previous two films.  Begins with the idea that this could be the third film in the 7 Gates Trilogy.  Although not as violent as Zombie Flesh Eaters, The Gates of Hell, or The Beyond, The film does contain some gory set pieces.  A bloody haunted house tale that employs the techniques of Lucio Fulci very well.  The story builds toward the pessemistic climax.\n\n Quella Villa Accanto al Cimitero&apos;s major weakness is the poor dubbing of Bob &amp; Mae.  Because they are voiced over by adults, the performances of the two children come out weak.  Walter Rizzati performs a main theme that sounds alot like the theme music of Don&apos;t Torture a Duckling.  One of my favorite film scores from a Fulci picture.  Tremendously influenced by the zombie classic, Let Sleeping Corpse Lie(1974).  This is one of the few Fulci films from the early 80s that Fabio Frizzi did not work on.\n\n The film crew seems at home since having done many films together.  I was impressed by the film when I first saw it.  House by the Cemetery is helped out by the presence of Catriona MacColl who gives it professional respectability.  One thing that annoyed some people is the scene where the babysitter is cleaning up blood with Mrs. Boyle not reacting to this.  This was not done purposely but resulted due to budget restraints and time limitations.  The House by the Cemetery(1981) was filmed after the editing of The Beyond(1981).\n\n Dr. Freudstein is another in a line of monsterous villains that follows Father Thomas and Schweik the painter.  He is the only zombie in an otherwise non zombie pic.  Even though he is not seen for most of the picture, his presence is still sinisterly felt.  His name seems to be a mixture of Dr. Frankenstein and Dr. Freud.  Dr. Freudstein in my opinion also seems to be inspired by the longevity seeking Dr. Charriere of HP Lovecraft/August Derleth&apos;s short story, THE SURVIVOR.  Dr. Freudstein is menacing and repulsive.\n\n The set designs are eye popping and fantastic.  The interiors of the Freudstein house from the past are stunning.  Another example of Fulci using great gothic designs for the film.  Part of the film was done in Concord, MA.  The antique look of the Freudstein house from the past is something out of a Mario Bava movie.  The House by the Cemetery(1981) is made special by the sight of gothic architecture in the small New England town.\n\n Revolves around the relationship between Bob Boyle and the ghost, Mae Freudstein.  They can communicate from far away while understanding each other&apos;s thoughts.  They are the opposite of Mr. and Mrs. Boyle who are limited in looking beyond what is there.  Bob Boyle and Mae are competently played by Giovanni Frezza &amp; Silvia Collatina.  Bob Boyle ends up in the same position as Liza and John from The Beyond(1981).  Mae&apos;s role serves the same purpose as a warner that Emily served in The Beyond(1981).\n\n Children play a vital role in Lucio Fulci&apos;s top films.  In his films, children are the bearers of innocence who are surrounded by a nature of violence.  Children are a crucial part in this film because they are the only ones who can sense danger.  Dr. Freudstein in my opinion represents the dark half of Norman Boyle.  The children in the film are inspired by characters in a Henry James Novella.  Its interesting that the doctor lures his victims by crying like a child.\n\n Quella Villa Accanto al Cimitero I feel had a profound influence on Clive Barker&apos;s Hellraiser(1987).  One example is the monster who needs victims to keep himself alive and fresh.  Another example is the architecture designs of Hellraiser(1987).  Combines the ideas of HP Lovecraft with Henry James and Ambrose Bierce.  Giannetto De Rossi produces some effective special effects for a low budget film.  Sergio Salvati is one of the key ingredients to this picture because of his fabulous cinematography and camera placement.\n\n House by the Cemetery(1981) is comparable to Mario Bava&apos;s Shock(1977).  Both have families who live in a house with a dark past.  Both have a child who talks to someone dead.  The two films have female characters who are on the verge of total breakdown.  House by the Cemetery &amp; Shock contain a downbeat ending.  These two rely on atmosphere and colorful set pieces.\n\n There are show stopping highlights in Quella Villa Accanto al Cimitero(1981).  One, the murder of the first victim played by Daniela Doria.  Two, the murder of Mrs. Gittleson where realistic make up effects are employed.  Three, the pix axe scene that is an encore of the &quot;Buried Alive&quot; sequence from City of the Living Dead(1980).  The scene where Mae envisions the death of Anne, the babysitter is brilliant.  The scene where the camera pans out from a house to a picture of that house is quite good and reminds me of a sequence towards the end of Brazil(1985)."

The story is about a murder, but starts out a little slow. Gradually it becomes more dramatic and thought provoking as it reaches the end. YOU&apos;VE GOT TO WATCH THIS PICTURE THROUGH TO THE END. It will stay in your mind for a very long time. The little boy, (Tim) Ben Faulkner is a brilliant actor. I haven&apos;t been able to find him in another movie and I don&apos;t understand why.He&apos;s great!!!\n\nAt the very least I&apos;d give this movie a 6.5/10.",

A pity because it is a charming film mainly about people over sixty falling in love with each other. This is not a usual focus, even now, and the acting is excellent. Ronald Reagan is given top billing where the great Spring Byington is not. Supported by Charles Coburn and Edmund Gwenn as her suitors the three make a wonderful trio. Which one will she marry ? This causes disruption in the very conservative household of Ronald Reagan and the sadly unused Ruth Hussey who was so good in &apos; The Philadelphia Story &apos; Piper Laurie is their daughter and Scotty Beckett her &apos; intellectual &apos; boyfriend. But it is Spring Byington who steals the film, and very good in other films she glows with charm and intelligence in this. The dance sequence where Charles Coburn and Edmund Gwenn wrestle literally for her attention is a gem of a scene, and for that alone this elusive film is worth tracking down. Is it dated ? Yes, in many ways but there is a remaining freshness about its approach to the elderly in love which brings humanity and understanding to a subject not treated enough in the cinema. I would give it more points but Reagan&apos;s weakness as a lead actor prevents me.",

The scenes of the toy factory really bring in the Christmas spirit for me. I was also surprise to see Christopher Lloyd back in films.. He has a wonderful role in this one. Also the soundtrack and all the songs are just wonderful.\n\nIf you don&apos;t like the buddies... at least rent this one for your kids.. it&apos;s a really touching Christmas tale.

      "reviewBody": "First of all it is better to watch the film in full 4.5 hr instead of watching as 2 parts, which is what I did in film fest.\n\nSecondly, you have to know a little of history and tradition of Taiwan and roles of aboriginals to truly have a feeling for the movie. Just Wiki &quot;Wushe Incident&quot;, and &quot;Taiwanese Aboriginal&quot; and that makes things much better as you watch.\n\nAnyway back to the film, the selling point seems to be all the killing, the action, the big budget. However after watching it I&apos;ve found out it&apos;s more about the value of &quot;death&quot; that the film tries to bring to us, and death weights in front of abstract values such as &quot;tradition&quot;, &quot;dignity&quot;, etc.\n\nIt&apos;s really an entertaining film for sure and throughout the 4.5 hrs time just flies, and you have to adjust yourself to have that desire to discover more about aboriginals believes and ways of living, much like watching documentary films mentality.\n\nI can&apos;t stop comparing this &quot;Civilization vs. Barbarian&quot; plot to what is happening in middle east right now. In such sense history is repeating, and the film is definitely pointing out how pointless the loss of lives is (depends on which stand you are taking though).\n\nOverall this is one of the best and most enjoyable films in recent years. The director is trying to lead us to think critically towards topics on death, values, tradition and how these would change when worlds collide.",

Not really, but well enough to scream and run from one overblown action scene to another, taking the odd breather for showers (plural) and changes of clothes. \n\nI kind of enjoyed this brainless tosh. Cinders looks great, adequately playing an uncompromising, smarty-pants attorney. Baldwin is the cop determined to guard her body when people start trying to kill her. He just about pulls off the hardass cop routine, but never really musters the enthusiasm to look like he&apos;s enjoying it. \n\nThe bad guys glower and plot, hunting the fleeing pair down with ruthless skill (and some rather suspect computer trickery), then cocking things up each time allowing them to escape. It&apos;s hugely violent, fast moving, loud, full of swearing etc.,  all the things you associate with nineties action fodder, and finishes off with a big enough bang. Don&apos;t expect much, and you shouldn&apos;t be disappointed.\n\nOh, and if you&apos;re wondering about nudity, Cindy does indeed get them out for the lads&apos;, and Baldwin shows his butt.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;5x2&quot; is not the first film to explore a relationship by going backwards from its end to its beginning (Pinter&apos;s &quot;Betrayal&quot; comes to mind let alone the mystery in &quot;Memento&quot;).\n\nBut writer/director François Ozon, aided by superb acting, uses the structure for a thoughtful and intriguing commentary on love and marriage.\n\nThe first scene sets up our curiosity as while a lawyer dryly reads the divorce agreement, letting us know the cold facts of the marriage, there is palpable electricity between the about to be ex-wife and husband such that we are not surprised when they immediately head to a hotel, as it turns out their relationship started in a hotel.\n\nWe are introduced to the complexities between this couple as their layers are played out through a sexual encounter that is open to &quot;he said, she said&quot; interpretations that will continue as we flashback to key points in their relationship. The other four incidents show them as parents, at the birth of their child, at their wedding and at their meeting, all played out in relation to her parents&apos; long-time conflicted marriage and his brother&apos;s homosexual arrangements, amid other encounters.\n\nValeria Bruni Tedeschi is so luminous as &quot;Marion&quot; that I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s her beautiful acting, as she is in turn up-tight, conflicted, sensual, fragile or aggressive, or her character who changes or that François Ozon is such a sensitive director of women, as he showed in &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; and &quot;Under the Sand (Sous le sable)&quot;, that I favored her character, even if we gradually learn that she may or may not be as much of a victim as it seems and she is as much influenced by physical imperatives as he is. Stéphane Freiss plays virtually the opposite of his caring husband in &quot;Le Grand Rôle,&quot; even if it becomes less and less clear he&apos;s the S.O.B. he at first could appear to be, or if his character experiences any changes or learns anything through serial somewhat monogamy, especially because some details in their past are just left mysterious.\n\nThe film is certainly not optimistic about love being an effective basis for a man and a woman to sustain a long term relationship and it leaves open-ended for a gendered discussion about whether that applies to the particulars of these individuals, or to them as French or as Europeans, vs. universals, as Americans would probably interpret their interactions differently than other audiences.\n\nCertainly, in a frankly sexually mature film it&apos;s nice to see non-Hollywood bodies, of a zaftig woman and a guy without a personal trainer credit listed.\n\nThe frequent use of Paolo Conte songs on the soundtrack add to the ironic feeling surrounding the film, even if the lyrics aren&apos;t translated in the many white-on-white subtitles.\n\nGoing off into the sunset, and the cinematography and production design, from dark to light, throughout are lovely, hasn&apos;t had such an ironic conclusion since the original &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "INVISIBLE AGENT (Universal, 1942), directed by Edwin L. Marin, is Universal&apos;s attempt in keeping H.G. Wells&apos; &quot;Invisible Man&quot; stories in circulation by bringing them up to date, this time through the use of an original screenplay by Curtis Siodmak. Jon Hall, best known for his South Seas adventure tales with Maria Montez, might have become an unlikely candidate for the title role, but succeeds on his own merits. Though not exactly in the same league as its predecessors, especially the original 1933 classic starring Claude Rains, it&apos;s more of a propaganda film than horror, in the tradition of earlier outings as ESPIONAGE AGENT (1939) and Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT (1940), both starring Joel McCrea.\n\nThe story opens in New York where foreign agents, Conrad Stauffer (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), a Nazi leader, and Baron Ikito (Peter Lorre), a Japanese, break into a printing shop run by Frank Raymond (Jon Hall), who&apos;s secretly the grandson of scientist Frank Griffin, inventor of an invisibility formula. (Is this in reference to Frank Griffin from THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS (1940), overlooking the fact that it was Jack Griffin from THE INVISIBLE MAN (1933), being the true inventor of that formula?) Knowing his true identity, the agents demand the formula from him. After going through the torture test that nearly causes him the loss of his fingers in a cutting machine, Frank manages to make his getaway and report the incident to John Gardiner (John Litel) of the American Embassy. When asked to relay the formula to the government, he refuses, but gives in after the bombing of Pearl Harbor that leads America into war, on the condition that he act as an invisible agent for America by spying on the Germans instead of their trained agents. Once he parachutes on enemy lines, Griffin, now invisible, follows his instructions by meeting with Arnold Schmidt (Albert Basserman), his contact, owner of a coffin shop, who secretly relays the information to England. Griffin&apos;s next assignment is to contact Maria Sorenson (Ilona Massey), Stauffer&apos;s mistress and counterspy who&apos;s under watch from Karl Heiser (J. Edward Bromberg), a Nazi officer. After finding himself trapped inside a fishing net full of hooks that leaves him helpless, Griffin accuses Maria, whom he now loves, to be his betrayer, and must somehow break free in order to acquire the secret plans revealing the Adolph Hitler&apos;s attack on New York.\n\nAlthough related to the previous Invisible Man sequels, INVISIBLE AGENT is often treated as an outsider mainly because it&apos;s more of a spy vs. spy story than the science fiction/mad scientist formula. Regardless of a fine supporting cast consisting of Hardwicke as the central villain and Lorre, even more menacing, coming close to resembling the Oriental sleuth, Mr. Moto, a character he portrayed in eight film mysteries during the late 1930s, through the use of his thick glasses, the somewhat unbalanced script appears to be geared more for the juvenile audiences out to cheer for their unseen hero. Humor takes precedence over the seriousness nature of the wartime story during its 81 minutes. Top-billed Ilona Massey, who arrives late in the story, plays a Mata Hari-type mystery woman leaving audiences wondering whose side she is on. That&apos;s one of the fun parts of the movie. Her key scenes include her encounter with the invisible agent and placing cold cream on him to see his face; and her attempt in having dinner with Nazi Heiser with the unseen Griffin having the time of his life disturbing them by moving things around and driving Heisler to the point of distraction. And speaking of driving, the plot is highlighted by a well staged car chase between Griffin and the Nazis. The scene where the invisible agent, giving himself a bath, covered with soap suds, is realistically done, thanks to John P. Fulton&apos;s first-rate contribution to the special effects department that equals the credibility to his earlier technique for THE INVISIBLE MAN and THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS.\n\nFormerly distributed on video cassette around the 1990s, and rarely visible on the television markets in recent years, INVISIBLE AGENT&apos;s current availability happens to be on DVD as part of its &quot;Invisible Man&quot; movie package. Next in the series, THE INVISIBLE MAN&apos;S REVENGE (1944) also starring Jon Hall. (**1/2)",

      "reviewBody": "Anyone expecting a John Woo/Ringo Lam-type actioner will be sorely disappointed by this Chinese film, &quot;The Missing Gun.&quot; Director Lu Chuan adopts western film-making techniques, but paces his film deliberately, not hurrying through the motions or adopting slam-bang action to tell his story.\n\nYou could draw parallels to Walter Hill&apos;s &quot;48 HRS.&quot; (1982) and Akira Kurosawa&apos;s &quot;Stray Dog&quot; (1949), both of which dealt with similar stories of a police officer losing his handgun, which falls into the hands of a criminal.\n\n&quot;The Missing Gun&quot; isn&apos;t as action-packed as Hill&apos;s film or as perceptive and intriguing as Kurosawa&apos;s. Then again, emulating Kurosawa is no easy task.\n\nBut the film provides an interesting lesson about gun culture. In this country, we have a nation obsessed with owning firearms. In &quot;The Missing Gun,&quot; the protagonist is a police officer Ma Shan (Jiang Wen) facing embarrassment, ridicule and shame for having lost his service pistol. Private ownership of guns is banned so the police know exactly how many bullets are left in the weapon.\n\nI am not advocating banning gun-ownership in this country, but &quot;The Missing Gun&quot; provides an intriguing cultural lesson, especially when we have an American president and congressional leaders who kowtowed to the gun lobby and recently let lapse the assault weapons ban, apparently not seeing the harm in letting the public purchase Uzis and AK-47s. Someone has still to explain to me why these weapons are needed to hunt.\n\n&quot;The Missing Gun&quot; does not adopt film-making styles seen in the works of Zhang Yimou or Chen Kaige. This film definitely has a western influence. The camera moves quickly, there are quick cuts and for a low-budget film - it was apparently shot for about $250,000 - the cinematography is spectacularly good. But instead of clichéd storytelling techniques, Lu Chuan gives us some novelty. There&apos;s a delightful chase scene and his characters certainly aren&apos;t conventional. Ma Shan spends much of the first act asking various people whether they&apos;ve stolen his gun. But there&apos;s a sense of mystery to all this, because we&apos;re never sure if they&apos;re being truthful. And the director opts for a denouement that&apos;s unexpected, especially if you&apos;ve grown up with American films. \n\n&quot;The Missing Gun&quot; is by no means a masterpiece. But it offers more insight into human nature than much of what Hollywood churns out these days. And if you&apos;re in the mood for something different, a film that takes its time unraveling the mystery, this film has much to offer the discriminating moviegoer.",

The scene between Sheen and Lohan was perhaps the worst thing I have ever seen, it was appalling, almost like an attempt to replicate the Pamela Anderson scene, but it was just terrible. The Black Swan scenes were lots of fun, and nicely produced, they felt at odds with lots of the film.\n\nIs it the case that people&apos;s humour has changed since the early films, or were the jokes simply not funny? Personally I think it&apos;s the latter, in fairness though it isn&apos;t as if there were great horror movies to parody.\n\nIt&apos;s poor, but will still give the odd chuckle. 5/10",

Of course this isn&apos;t going to be on any critics&apos; top ten lists, nor will it win any awards anywhere, but the extraordinary films that wind up in those categories often have little to no replay value - once you&apos;ve seen them, they&apos;re pretty much done. &quot;Grind&quot; is a film that&apos;s so enjoyable, it&apos;s easy to watch it over and over and over again.

      "reviewBody": "Sydney Pollak has directed a lot of good films over the last 40 years, and this, though not his finest work, is one. But it&apos;s just &apos;good&apos;. Pollak has a great sense of pacing and character development, and he puts both to work to good effect in this suspenseful high-stakes terrorism drama. Kidman and Penn deliver solid and memorable performances and are joined by an excellent supporting cast. The acting talent, clever though predictable plot, superior production and cinematography, and fearlessly quirky script are what makes this film work, despite a few rather absurd plot points.\n\nKidman unsurprisingly, dominates the screen with a powerful portrayal of a young South African translator for the UN, who overhears a plot to assassinate the genocidal president of her home country, Motambo. Penn plays a hard-nosed, recently widowed investigator assigned to the case. As the plot escalates, it becomes clear that Kidman herself is also a target and that she has secrets...\n\nThere are some problems with believability here. Most glaring is the fact that the intelligence agents and security people investigating Kidman and the plot to kill a genocidal African president in the U.N. are depicted as anything but intelligent. The identity of the perpetrator and the nature of the intended crimes should have been more or less obvious about half-way through the film, and the security team should have had a trap set and armed personnel crawling all over the entire building. It is also unlikely that anybody in Kidman&apos;s predicament would have been allowed to continue with unrestricted access to the UN, at virtually any time of day or night, more or less unwatched. And it is even more problematic that somebody with her background should be working at the UN in the first place. The actors&apos; performances and the relationship which develops between the two main characters (which is really at least half the plot) help to gloss over the minor problems and make the film very entertaining and suspenseful. There are also some potentially powerful political messages just below the surface, but I never felt that these messages really emerged, and was left wondering if theyr were simply artistic flourishes or perhaps, posturing.",

The plot is what you get when you put &quot;Casper, the Friendly Ghost&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; and &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; together. If that is not messed up enough, you have this movie here. And the irony is, I like most Euro-cult cinema too.\n\nThe &quot;plot&quot; is split into three scenarios: One dealing with poachers, the other dealing with pop singers camping it up and the third dealing with a rather fruity and feminine looking little boy named Tommy, whom is thought to be weird to his mom and uncle, because he collects centipede &quot;specimens&quot; and the such. Later, the she-male himself finds one alien pod that was not destroyed and he takes it home and decided to raise it as it was his own, thus the birth of Trumpy, whom looks across between Alf and a Teletubby. Yeah, he is that creepy and weird looking.\n\nMan, sounded like an interesting concept, but poor execution and half-done editing. But hey, it would not be on MST3K if it were not for that *LOL*\n\nNow seriously, though a messed up movie, it is not the worst. Leave that up to &quot;Monster a Go-Go&quot;."

Most of the hand to hand fighting sequences are not well done, they might have worked better in slow motion. Other parts (the shooting fights mostly) were not that bad. Other than that the sets and the effects were reasonably well done. If the inexperienced main cast had had more time to get into their roles (the inexperienced director might have done a better job) and the supporting veteran actors had put in more effort, the story would have been more believable.\n\nIn all, I would not suggest you build your evening on this flick, but if you have the choice between this one and reality TV shows, you might want to opt for this &quot;fan film&quot; product.",

Ethnic Russians lord it over ethnic Estonians with the threat of denunciations that lead to arbitrary deportation or arrest.\n\nSince the external events marring the life of her family don&apos;t make sense, Leelo creates her own cause and effect. It doesn&apos;t help that the adults in her life don&apos;t and can&apos;t level with her, because then she might well say something indiscreet-- anti-Russian or anti-Communist. (She&apos;s not particularly good at following simple directions.)\n\nOverall, it&apos;s a good kid&apos;s movie, and a good adult&apos;s movie, too.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a massive fan of the horror genre, but I don&apos;t like ghost stories. To me, ghost stories are a poor manifestation of the genre. It&apos;s not the idea of ghosts that&apos;s the problem, it&apos;s the way the stories are presented; often dull, slow moving and uninteresting, and those are things that do not make a good movie. However, there is an exception to every rule; and this film is the case with that one. The Devil&apos;s Backbone is a mesmerising and inventive addition to the ghost story tradition. The film moves slowly, but that is a definite advantage to it. The slow pace allows us to get to know, and even care for the characters before the horror starts, and this makes the horror all the more potent when it does start. The Devil&apos;s Backbone has been touted as &apos;the Spanish Sixth Sense&apos;, and although this is unfair as this is hardly a bad film; I can see where that notion is coming from. The main difference between the two, however, and the reason why this film works and Shyamalan&apos;s doesn&apos;t is that the parts between the horror here aren&apos;t boring, are well acted and serve a purpose in that they allow us to get to know the characters; Shyamalan got too caught up in trying to make his twist work and the drama in-between caught the brunt of that, rendering the film boring.\n\nThe film can&apos;t really be accurately described as a &apos;horror film&apos;, it&apos;s more of a drama come character study with horror elements. The horror elements are pronounced, as the ghost is the centrepiece of the story, but the film doesn&apos;t focus on them enough for it to be considered horror. Entwined within it&apos;s plot is a coming of age tale, a story of revenge and a nice little section on &apos;what is a ghost&apos;. I like it when a film delves into it&apos;s subject material and attempts to give something of an explanation; Return of the Living Dead did it for zombies (albeit comically), and The Devil&apos;s Backbone does it here for ghosts. The coming of age side of the story is brought to life brilliantly by some sublime acting courtesy of the young cast. Entwined within the story are themes of the kids being thrust into a situation that requires them to grow up fast, and it also sees them dealing with themes of death and revenge. \n\nOne thing you will instantly notice about this film is the fantastic cinematography. The film has a gritty style, but despite this it manages to come off looking crisp and clean. There are some shots that are incredibly beautiful. All shots with the ghost, which is one of the best crafted ever, come to mind immediately but also of note are the underwater sequences, the special effects and the capture of the location. The film is set in an orphanage somewhere the Spanish desert, and this location serves the movie magnificently. The fact that it&apos;s a day&apos;s walk away from the nearest town makes the film very isolated, which allows the horror more potency. Guillermo Del Toro is an obviously talented director. He has this film under his belt, along with Cronos (which I haven&apos;t yet seen, but have heard great things), but after that it&apos;s hit and miss. Blade 2 was a good film, and a refreshing one after the lackluster first part; but Mimic wasn&apos;t very good on the whole, despite some good moments. More recently he&apos;s gone on to direct Hellboy, which again I haven&apos;t seen but it looks like another fun film. I hope Del Toro makes a return to art soon, he has the talent and it would be a shame to lose him to &apos;decent&apos; films.",

      "reviewBody": "The greatest pleasure of this fun DeMille classic is the sublime performance of the radiant Leatrice Joy.  From the great opening shot, of her speeding along in her roadster, to the final clinch, she eats up the screen with her energy and, dare I say it, joy of living!  Joy was more than just a substitute for Gloria Swanson in DeMille&apos;s films - she brought a different sort of vigour to her roles, a true Jazz Age energy that Clara Bow would later build upon.  She is certainly an actress that deserves to be re-discovered.\n\nThe story, of a shallow fun-loving rich girl discovering that the true meaning of life is service to others, is rather too moral to be taken seriously - especially as DeMille can&apos;t help creating two completely gratuitous, but highly enjoyable, &quot;flash-backs&quot; to Ancient Rome, featuring wild orgies (and even a lesbian kiss!!).  It&apos;s the usual clash between DeMille&apos;s fascination with sex and sado-masochism and his need to moralise against such things.\n\nIt all adds up to a visually stunning entertainment.  Don&apos;t miss it!",

      "name": "&quot;Yogi Bear&quot; is an Old Friend with a New Look",
      "reviewBody": "To bring the younger viewers up to speed - Yogi Bear has been around since the 1960s, he started as a cartoon &quot;pick-a-nic&quot; basket-stealing bear in Jellystone Park. He had a good run for several years and eventually faded into the background with a few television reboots along the way. Thanks to 3D live-action/ CGI wizardry, Yogi is back on the big screen. In the new &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; movie, he appears brand new in all of his CGI magnificence yet he maintains his familiar look and catch phrases at the same time. He&apos;s hasn&apos;t come back alone, he brought his old side kick Boo Boo, also in CGI, and his friendly nemesis Park Ranger Smith.\n\nYogi (voiced by Dan Aykroyd) starts the movie with what he is known for - stealing picnic baskets from visitors of Jellystone Park. In Aykroyd&apos;s best Ed Norton impersonation (for the younger viewers that is a character from the 1950s television series &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;) he self narrates his strategies so not to lose the audience along the way. Yogi and his accomplice in petty thievery, Boo Boo (voiced by Justin Timberlake) are continually devising new methods to steal food from the tourists to Jellystone Park. Yogi is the da Vinci mastermind while Boo Boo is the rational voice of conscientiousness. They opt for stealing because the alternative is to resort to foraging for food like the &quot;average bear.&quot; Word about Yogi&apos;s pilfering gets back to Ranger Smith (played by Tom Cavanagh) who has a long history of battling with Yogi. Instead of just shooting Yogi full of tranquilizer darts and dragging his body to another park (that&apos;s my idea, it&apos;s not in the movie), Ranger Smith uses his sternness to reprimand Yogi therefore upholding law and order within Jellystone. Yogi soon goes back to his cave and Ranger Smith goes back to his cabin and the cycle of picnic basket pilfering continues.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Franklin City, Mayor Brown (played by Andrew Daly) is making plans to sell off Jellystone. He needs the money to bring his city out of debt and with a coy evilness, he rationalizes that each resident of Franklin City will make money off the deal. Daly was a fresh enjoyment to watch as the nemesis; delivering his role so both children and adults could pick up on the humor of a fun yet despicable character.\n\nA three-way conflict soon begins with Ranger Smith stuck in the middle. Yogi is disrupting the tourists and the mayor is trying to close Jellystone Park. Then, in steps Rachel (played by Anna Farris) who is filming a nature documentary. On top of that Ranger Jones (played by TJ Miller) is gunning for the job of top ranger (it&apos;s funny because there are only two rangers for the entire park). It seems like a multi-level story line but the director, Eric Brevig, presents the smaller stories in a clear-cut linear format where even the youngest viewer can pick up on what is happening.\n\nWhile tension is building between Mayor Brown and Ranger Smith, the 100th anniversary of Jellystone is upon them. At the celebration, Yogi (who was only trying to help) ruins everything and the park closes. At Ranger Smith&apos;s lowest point, he loses not only the park and his job, but also a chance with Rachel too. Knowing that his intelligence is also a hindrance, Yogi tries a life of being an &quot;average bear&quot; but that doesn&apos;t suit him. He and Boo Boo soon devise a scheme to rescue the park and to stop Mayor Brown from becoming Governor Brown.\n\nShould you see this movie? Yes, it&apos;s simple yet charming. There were a lot of jokes for an older and younger audience. You didn&apos;t have to grow up with the cartoon to enjoy this newer version of an old classic, just be a fan of clean humor.",

      "reviewBody": "For lovers of this great french comedian this movie is best watched with the remote control in one hand. The story is the typical mix of little choleric Louis (playing the director of an all girl dancing group) who tries to shield them from other men so that the girls won&apos;t be distracted from their job. There are a couple of well directed scenes that provide good laughs and Louis delivers the whole range of his facial expressions that alone makes you giggle. However this time the script seems to have lacked enough ideas for a full movie, therefore you will have to sit through plenty of dancing and music and even an almost unbearable singing scene where Louis de Funes sings musical-like. Approx. half of the movie time is being consumed by music, dance and singing only - too much for a comedy.\n\nTherefore my advice: skip those dull scenes with the fast forward of your remote control and have a good laugh at Louis while he is really acting (and not dancing or singing).",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s taken me a while to track down a copy of &apos;The Anderson Tapes&apos;, but I&apos;m sure glad I did. I was knocked out by this consistently interesting caper movie. Sean Connery, post-Bond, pre-Zardoz, plays Duke Anderson, a recently released criminal who decides to rob the luxury apartment block his high class hooker girlfriend (Dyan Cannon) resides in. He assembles a team which includes &quot;The Kid&quot; (an unbelievably young and cool Christopher Walken in his first major movie role), his flamboyant art loving buddy Tommy (&apos;Psycho&apos;s Martin Balsam camping it up outrageously), the super cool Everson (Garrett Morris), and (against his will) Mafia goon Socks (Val Avery). Duke however doesn&apos;t realize that he, and just about everyone else involved in the plan, are under surveillance by a multitude of government agencies who are following their every move. &apos;The Anderson Tapes&apos; is an entertaining and tough little thriller full of humour and originality, and with an almost &apos;Conversation&apos;-like feel to it - a movie it predated by three years incidentally. While nowhere near as well known as Sidney Lumet&apos;s other Seventies crime dramas &apos;Serpico&apos; and &apos;Dog Day Afternoon&apos; it is equally as good. An extremely underrated movie that deserves a lot more attention."

While I enjoy experiencing cinema from different cultures this had very little of merit.\n\nOther reviews mention the morality and standards laid down for a younger audience, I&apos;m amazed. The main character turns to crime while he pursues his dream of being an actor and falls in love with the whole with a heart. This storyline has been told a thousand times and mostly in a much better manner than this. I struggled to stay awake watching this and couldn&apos;t in all honesty reccomend this to anyone.",

Danish princes are practically always called Christian or Frederik, we currently don&apos;t have a king but a queen, we speak Danish and our newspapers are also in Danish, and monarchs are not allowed to be involved in politics. I&apos;m sure there is more, but I can&apos;t remember.\n\nBut it&apos;s a cute story, predictable, but it&apos;s a romantic comedy, and those are predictable.\n\nSee it, enjoy it, but don&apos;t take it too literally.",

It is directed by Nobuhiro Doi, director of great romance films and series such as Be With You and Nada Sou Sou. 2. It is starred by Ikuta Toma, Aragaki Yui, and Mukai Osamu. OMG!!! &gt;0&lt; 3. It is based on the most beautiful song of the same name by Hitoto You. ... and so on.\n\nI almost screamed out of joy when knowing that it would be released in Thailand at Apex and House cinemas and managed to get some tickets to the Thailand film premiere at last.\n\nHanamizuki tells a tear-jerking love story similar to Be With You and Nada Sou Sou (but not as much tear-jerking as the two Doi&apos;s previous films). The film is sad, but I found it encouraging rather than depressing. Kind of encouraging people to be true to love. \n\nToma, Gakky, and Osamu have all delivered such great performances. So talented and natural as they are, fans will not be disappointed. The scenery in the film were also very well-chosen. On the other hand, the plot of the film is a bit too &apos;soap opera&apos; and has pulled down the film somewhat, pity.\n\nAll in all, the film is definitely worth watching for the brilliant Toma &amp; Gakky, just don&apos;t expect too much of the plot. ^^\n\n*Notice* Please continue watching the end credits to see various nice pics.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Best Actor Oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the Mutiny on the Bounty leads of Clark Gable, Charles Laughton, and Franchot Tone who were all in the same race. But The Informer is still a fine film because John Ford wouldn&apos;t have gotten his first Best Director Oscar if it wasn&apos;t. No split involved in his award.\n\nThe movie and the story by Liam O&apos;Flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. He was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in. He&apos;s down to his last pence and if he can&apos;t get back in, wants enough for passage to America. There&apos;s a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan constabulary and informs on McPhillip.\n\nThe IRA is pretty anxious to find out who ratted McPhillip out and they&apos;re pretty certain it was McLaglen. He hasn&apos;t the wit to really cover his own tracks. He does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named Peter Mulligan played by Donald Meek. He also picks up a hanger-on played by J.M. Kerrigan.\n\nThe whole action of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning. Of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows, making it possibly the first noir thriller. Had it been done post World War II The Informer would have ranked as a great noir classic, like Odd Man Out or the The Third Man which it bares a lot of resemblance to.\n\nJohn Ford knew this world very well. He took some time off during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name before having it anglicized was Sean O&apos;Fiernan.\n\nPreston Foster plays the IRA commandant Dan Gallagher. In the book Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has him here. My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest. He makes it clear that Foster has to eliminate the informer because the Black and Tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril.\n\nThe IRA trial scene is the highlight of the film. When Foster asks Donald Meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court, Meek ain&apos;t in a position to say no. The King&apos;s justice and writ does not run here. It graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary, the British are indeed losing their grip on the population.\n\nOf course The Informer a rather grim story has its John Ford touches, but rather fewer than you would expect. Even as McLaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree, the IRA is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing.\n\nThe Informer is a tale well told about Ireland in a grim and dismal time.",

      "reviewBody": "Much about this Arctic adventure film looks to be inspiration for JURASSIC PARK.\n\nAlthough there are no prehistoric beasts, there are beasts. It is the characters and the nature of the experience which reminds a viewer of Jurassic Park.\n\nThe characters are all quite believable, making for what typically makes the best story line, credible characters in incredible situations.\n\nHowever, this situation is not as incredible as Jurassic Park.\n\nStill, the characters remind us of it. We have &quot;good&quot; guys for the most part, and the &quot;bad&quot; guys are not really &quot;bad&quot; so much as victims of circumstance of their personalities.\n\nJurassic had three bad guys, and didn&apos;t contrive too much in their fates, as two bad guys perish along with at least two heroic types, leaving the most insane and irresponsible of the evil men alive and smelling pretty and still rich.\n\nHere, there is a similar character, a maniac who risks the lives of his group in folly, not waiting for the time to tell him when to explore, but deciding he is a god who tells time when he can explore.\n\nIn real life, such a maniac would perish, and the other unstable character can actually be excused his madness, for he does so out of a hunger we probably can&apos;t imagine.\n\nAnd like Jurassic, there is no contrivance to save heroes, bad guys, the brave, or anyone. The chips fall where the chips fall, with just enough miraculous survival to be credible.\n\nThe experience is harrowing, and full of adventure. It is a bit chaotic, as we aren&apos;t sure who these people are for a long time, but we gradually learn to care about them.\n\nThis is an exciting film, and has all the credentials of a good film. Thumbs up.",

      "reviewBody": "Jeff and Beau Bridges - brothers in real life - are here united to play brothers on the screen. It&apos;s not the first time real-life brothers have played fictitious brothers in a movie (in fact, in The Long Riders several famous siblings paired up to similar effect). However, The Fabulous Baker Boys really benefits from the pairing. The sibling rivalry that runs through this film feels very credible and very convincing, possibly because Jeff and Beau aren&apos;t really acting but are simply using their real-life love/hate brotherly attitudes to fuel their performances in front of the cameras.\n\n It&apos;s a fairly thin story, but well told. Jack Baker (Jeff B.) and Frank Baker (Beau B.) have spent years working together as stage pianists in various bars, hotels and night-clubs around Seattle. Their long-running act begins to run out of steam and they find themselves playing to empty rooms.... even their more established employers begin to express doubts about their ability to pull in the big crowds. They decide to hire a female vocalist to spice up the appeal of their show and, after over thirty awful applicants, they finally unearth a winner in the shape of Suzy Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer). Initially, Suzy provides them with a turn in their fortunes, but the future of the trio becomes cloudy when she and Jack develop sexual yearnings for each other. The problems don&apos;t stop there, with Frank and Jack slowly becoming more and more distant with each other as their views on how best to market their musical talents are revealed to be very different.\n\n The Fabulous Baker Boys is extremely well-acted throughout, with Pfeiffer in particular giving an outstanding performance (she even sang most of her own songs). The main themes of sibling rivalry and unfulfilled talent are generally engrossing, and help to paper over the thinness of the story. Jeff acts rather moodily for much of the time and is very believable as a man working in the lower ranks of his trade when he could&apos;ve reached the top. Beau is also in fine form as a performer who does what he does simply because it puts money in the family kitty. It&apos;s a hard film to describe, because it&apos;s not really about very much, but if you can adjust to the relaxed pace and just enjoy the leisurely development of the three main characters then you will come away from the film feeling thoroughly satisfied.",

      "reviewBody": "I have been going to the Audi festival of German Films for a few years now and i was able to catch this film in this years run of the fest, here in Melbourne.\n\nI wont touch on the plot too much as it can be found in the full summary on the main page of the film. What i will say is yes the base story has been done many times, and even with that said this is still uniquely brilliant. Why? well here why i think so.... The movies director Florian Micoud Cossen who also wrote the movie with Elena von Saucken, clearly researched extensively for the writing and making of this film they captured the diverse personalities of buenos Aires city, Argentinians perfectly from the hotel desk clerk to the kiosk owner to the hard to deal with lazy woman police officer, to the talkative joking police man and family culture. This movie made a lot of us laugh in the screening as some of the things said in Spanish were so spot on as to what an Argentinian would say to family or even to a cute girl tourist you would meet at a cafe or hostel. Even a popular kids character Topo Gigio in toy form makes an appearance.\n\nThe acting is spot on and real the main character played by Jessica Schwarz is excellent, her character is not a naive character which is a trait found in actresses that have been cast in similar roles in other movies. Her character is very strong willed and independent. The acting is flawless by all in this movie it feels and looks natural not forced in any way.\n\nThis is not a fancy polished Hollywood style movie in fact from what a spokesperson said before the movie its the directors debut and from what i saw i will be keeping my eye open for further films from the director and the acting cast. This movie really leaves you thinking and as someone who knows a lot about south American and European history, one cant help but see that sometimes their are no happy endings in the lives of those affected by atrocities of political nature we can only embrace the future with hope and keep going forward no matter were we are from.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Unnaturals&quot; isn&apos;t nearly on par with director Antonio - oh sorry, he prefers Anthony M. Dawson - Margheriti&apos;s best efforts in the genre, notably &quot;Danza Macabra&quot; and &quot;The Long Hair of Death&quot;, but it&apos;s nonetheless a worthwhile and enjoyable gothic soap opera. The film benefices most from the unsettling atmosphere, genuine décors and the bright use of mandatory gothic aspects, like raging thunderstorms and enigmatic beauties. A bunch of greedy and self-centered people, each of them hiding dark secrets and/or scheming sinister plans, end up in a ramshackle old shed in the woods when their car gets stuck in the mud. Inside the cabin, a spooky old hag is stuck in a sort of bizarre trance, but her equally spooky son (Bava-regular Luciano Pigozzi) invites the guests to partake in an all-revealing séance. The pacing is often slow, and the flashbacks contain too many tedious and irrelevant parts, but the last 10-15 minutes make up for a lot. The seemingly everlasting thunderstorm causes havoc, which ensures a spectacular and unforeseeable climax.\n\nPS: I&apos;m not in the habit of criticizing DVD-releases, but in case you consider purchasing this film via the French label &quot;Les Chefs-d&apos;oeuvre du Gothique&quot;, I strongly recommend you NOT TO. Despite being quite expensive, the picture and sound quality are poor, the disc constantly falters and the audio switches back and forth between Italian and German.",

Friends of the movie&apos;s main characters tell me that until today they are unable to mention - in any small reference - communism. Indeed, the non-indigenous researchers did a splendid job finding some of the community&apos;s most important actors to this very day. I love that place, and those people - they have been good to me, an outsider. We are always hoping they continue to be good to one another, insiders. As a movie review, I highly suggest that ALL persons of Indonesian educational background should see this excellent documentary. It discusses and denies the state sponsored &quot;history&quot; of 1965 propaganda movie that you who were students were forced to watch in local theaters since 1984; and as such, it presents a new truth.",

      "reviewBody": "The first western I ever saw, QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER is my favorite. It&apos;s a great homage to the classic westerns of the past, with all the best elements combined in a fun movie about one man&apos;s fight against an evil land baron who (unknown to the hero) wanted to hire him to kill the local Aborigines, not the dingos as the hero originally thought. Tom Selleck ads another top-notch western to his resume, long with THE SACKETTS, THE SHADOW RIDERS, and the more-recent CROSSFIRE TRAIL. Alan Rickman is great as the bad guy, one of those characters you love to hate, and the beautiful Laura San Giacomo is a perfect western girl, whose (thankfully) is not the kind who becomes kidnapped and must be rescued. In fact, she spends a good deal of the film away from the action, caring for an Aborigine baby who was the only survivor of a tribe massacre earlier in the film. Director Simon Wincer proves what a genius he is at making westerns. He gets the most from everything, from the costumes to the performances, from the sweeping panoramic shots of the Australian outback to Basil Poledouris&apos;s lush score. And of course, no review of QUIGLEY would be complete without mentioning that awesome Sharps rifle. I cringe every time that wonderful rifle is thrown to the ground by Rickman. Glad to see that a DVD release is on the way, though it appears to be sorely lacking in the bonus features department. Anybody who likes westerns should check this film out. It&apos;s pretty family-friendly, too, with no harsh swearing and violence that never gets bloody or glorified."

When her husband comes to her defense they beat him up and then rape the woman before continuing on their way. They then come upon a woman by the name of &quot;Gail Maddox&quot; (Holle K. Winters) and her husband &quot;Cory Maddox&quot; (Alex Rocco) who proceed to escape. Undaunted Brahmin leads his two companions to Cory and Gail&apos;s house and then rape her while he is away. Swearing revenge he decides to follow them. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven&apos;t seen it I will just say that this turned out to be a pretty good film all things considered. I especially liked the performance of Haji (aka Barbarella Catton) as &quot;Ruby Bonner&quot; who seemed to dominate every scene she was in. On the flip side, however, I didn&apos;t really care for the rather bizarre ending that much. In any case, I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",

I thought this one might have inspired Michael Haneke&apos;s FUNY GAMES but concluded that there&apos;s very little sense of drama or black humor in it. Instead, it wound up about horrid people doing horrid things for no clear reason -- I don&apos;t believe &quot;They&apos;re psychopaths!&quot; to be sufficient motivation absent other items of interest, and there weren&apos;t any here. This was rejected for a theatrical license in Great Britain when it first was released. I do not approve of censorship, but can certainly understand why. I cannot recommend this movie except to those who enjoy blood sport solely for the gore.",

However even that flawed follow-up wiped the floor with the brainless &quot;action movies&quot; Hollywood spews out year after year. &apos;Tokyo Fist&apos;, while not directly related to the &apos;Tetsuo&apos; films, takes many of their elements, themes and hyperkinetic style, sets it in a more recognizable and relatively normal setting, and pulls off one of the most powerful and confronting movies you&apos;ll ever see.\n\nThe basic plot of a love triangle set against the background of explicit and life-altering violence cannot fail to remind the viewer of &apos;Fight Club&apos;. In fact the parallels are so similar that one must wonder whether the creators of &apos;Fight Club&apos; (novel or movie) are aware of this movie. To my mind &apos;Tokyo Fist&apos; is a much more original, morally ambiguous and complex film than that overrated piece of MTV nihilism. Some people have questioned what the &quot;real meaning&quot; of this movie is. To me that speaks volumes regarding it&apos;s worth. No-one I&apos;m sure would have to ask what &apos;Fight Club&apos; is &quot;really&quot; about. It&apos;s so bloody obvious and spelled out for the audience. &apos;Tokyo Fist&apos; is nowhere near as simplistic. It makes you THINK. Kudos to Tsukamoto for creating such an interesting and extreme cinematic experience!"

As it turns out, Ms. Ankers survived the crash and took up residence in a &quot;Shangri-la&quot; known to only a select few, Tarzan being one of them. He retrieves Ankers because she can clear a man unjustly accused of murder...\n\nBut the fact that she didn&apos;t age while living in &quot;The Blue Valley&quot; for 20 years attracts the criminal element...\n\nRKO and producer Sol Lesser kept the &quot;Tarzan&quot; series going by green lighting Mr. Barker as a replacement for the departing Johnny Weissmuller. In his first appearance as the character, Barker fills the loincloth comfortably. This was the last appearance of Ms. Joyce as Tarzan&apos;s &quot;Jane&quot; and it&apos;s also her best-acted appearance. Albert Dekker and Charles Drake make fine villains. Considering how the film ends, &quot;The Magic Fountain&quot; provides an implicit explanation for Tarzan&apos;s suddenly more youthful appearance.\n\n***** Tarzan&apos;s Magic Fountain (2/5/49) Lee Sholem ~ Lex Barker, Brenda Joyce, Evelyn Ankers, Albert Dekker",

      "reviewBody": "ROBIN HOOD AND THE PIRATES (1960) is an enjoyable Italian costume adventure with a particularly fanciful rendition of the Robin Hood tale, set entirely in a Mediterranean &apos;Sherwood,&apos; with the pirates of the title, standing in for the Merry Men, camping out in a &apos;forest&apos; that looks suspiciously like a beach. (The waves hitting the sand are a dead giveaway.) Interestingly, the place marker for Sherwood reads &apos;Conten di Sherwood.&apos;\n\nLex Barker, a former Tarzan (1949-53), cuts a striking figure in a traditional Robin Hood outfit and wields a mean sword and bow and arrow as he battles the usurper, Lord Brooks, who killed his father and took over Sherwood. Robin&apos;s aligned with a group of shipwrecked pirates who offer some half-hearted help at various times and includes a multi-racial group of &apos;Saracen&apos; women, led by a hefty black woman named Bambola, who prefers to be called &apos;Sweetpea&apos; and is played by American singer Edith Peters. She speaks with an American southern accent, despite the fact that the American South was still hundreds of years in the future at the time this film is set. However, she sings a song in Italian at one point and develops a yen for the equally hefty white pirate captain, &apos;One-Eye&apos; (played by American actor Walter Barnes). Peters had performed in the U.S. in the 1940s with her sisters in a trio called, appropriately enough, the Peters Sisters. \n\nThe Vienna-born Jackie Lane plays Robin&apos;s impassioned love interest, Karin Blain. Lord Brooks keeps trying to marry her and Robin Hood keeps rescuing her, until the final melee involving all the townsfolk, pirates and the Lord&apos;s knights. Lord Brooks&apos;s daughter, Lisbeth (played by Rossana Rory), complicates things by desiring Robin herself. The stunning Miss Lane appeared in a wide range of films in England and Europe in the 1950s and early &apos;60s and was also known as Jocelyn Lane during a lengthy Hollywood stint in the mid-to-late &apos;60s, which included playing opposite Elvis Presley in TICKLE ME (1965). Her first film happened to be an earlier Robin Hood film, MEN OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1954).\n\nThe film is nicely photographed on location at a genuine castle situated atop a seaside cliff. The tone of the film is lighthearted in the manner of some of the old Hollywood swashbucklers, with the pirates and Bambola providing comedy relief, while filled with sufficient swordfighting, horse-riding and castle wall-climbing action to keep even the genre&apos;s most jaded fans happy."

      "reviewBody": "This is a very humanistic film. It shows the bravery, suffering, humor and strength of both men and women who were defending an island in the Phillipines called Corregidor in the first five months of World War II. I think it was meant to be a tribute to those men and women and I think it works as a tribute. \n\nUnfortunately the DVD copy, as most reviewers have mentioned, is not very good. I am not sure if the problem is in the print used or the transfer. It is possible that the print had faded, so there was little that could have been done. It would be nice to see a good print if one exists with a good transfer.\n\nThe movie is a little bit of everything, some light, romantic scenes, some comradely kidding scenes, some strong gutsy speeches, and a lot of battle action. Hanging over these elements and keeping them from being enjoyable is the notion that this was ultimately a hard, military defeat. Surprisingly, an almost equal number of Americans and Japanese are seen dying in the battles.\n\nWhen this film was made in 1943, the war still going on. Corregidor was only recaptured in 1945. 800 Americans were killed and some 11,000 American and Philipinos were still prisoners of war when the film was made. The Japanese lost 900 men. A simple operation that was supposed to take only a few weeks, ended up taking them five months. The time and manpower they lost was crucial and hoped set up the defeats the Japanese suffered in the next few months of the war. \n\nThis is actually a much grittier, more heartfelt and less romantic view of this battle than the popular John Ford/John Wayne movie made about it two years later, &quot;They Were Expendable&quot;. That was a satisfying Hollywood movie that was more of a celebration than a tribute. There is little in that film of the gloomy atmosphere that appears in this film.\n\nThe script by Doris Malloy and great low-budget filmmaker Edgar Ulmer is fine. Direction by veteran director William Nigh (this was number 106 out 120 films) is crisp. The battles in the second half of the film do seem to dominate the human characters. None of the battles are spectacular and they become a bit monotonous and even boring. Perhaps that is better than the glamorous and exciting battles that one so often finds in Hollywood war movies. It gives the film a somber, rather than a Gung-Ho tone and message. \n\nThis is not a great movie, but it is a good one worth watching, even on a DVD copy of a bad print.",

      "reviewBody": "Alan Arkin playing Clouseau would have to rank as one of the most awful casting choices ever made. (Will Smith as Mohammed Ali? Close. Di Crapio as a tough guy in 19th-century New York? Very close.) Arkin has never played clowns, nor is he one. He is far too cynical-looking for this type of role. Watching him say his lines was an exercise in embarrassment and major cringing. I suppose that die-hard PP fans who have nothing better to do can have endless discussions as to who was worse: Martin or Arkin. Maybe it&apos;ll take another 40 years for someone to attempt to make a PP movie without Sellers. What with the direction Hollywood is heading towards in recent years, it&apos;ll be someone like David Arquette&apos;s son who&apos;ll be cast to play the goofy Frenchman...\n\nOne person here wrote that one should forget about Peter Sellers and watch this movie on its own merits. Maybe he/she can do that, probably with some help from hallucinogenic drugs, but personally I&apos;d find that a task both impossible and stupid. The fact is that Sellers DID do Panther earlier and was about 1000 times better.\n\nArkin is terminally unfunny with the sight gags, but it&apos;s the dialogue that really exposes his miscasting: there isn&apos;t a single line he says that is even remotely funny.\n\nIn all fairness, though, the script is garbage. The story has no flow, just a bunch of barely connected scenes strung together, the gags being rare and rather pathetic. The only thing the movie has going for it are the high production values, which make it watchable, if nothing else."

      "reviewBody": "Back when A Force of One was originally released, I viewed Chuck Norris&apos; movies as boring, brainless, and cheap. In the years since, I&apos;ve changed that original assessment and can see them for what they really are. Now I look at these early Chuck Norris&apos; movies as fun, brainless, and cheap.\n\nThe plot is incredibly simple and shows a total lack of creativity. When two cops are killed by someone using Martial Arts, they seek out the one man who might be able to help them - the local karate champion, Matt Logan (Norris). The cops quickly persuade Matt to help them, but when Matt&apos;s son turns up dead, he goes from helping to an active participant.\n\nInstead of writing a regular review or pointing out strengths and weaknesses in the movie, I&apos;ll just list a few random thoughts I had while watching:\n\n· It&apos;s not that the cops are skeptical about how karate can help them, a few act like they can&apos;t even pronounce the word. · The needle marks in that girl&apos;s arm makes it look like she been using a turkey-baster to shoot-up with. · You would think that after one set of cops is killed that the superior officer would do a better job of keeping track of where and what his men are working on. · Wow, a ninja in the stockroom! You just don&apos;t see enough of stuff like that in real life. · If you couldn&apos;t guess that Matt&apos;s son was going to get into serious trouble when he started his own investigating, you haven&apos;t seen enough bad action movies. · The identities of the bad guys are so obvious it&apos;s embarrassing. · Why is the police captain wearing a Matt Logan t-shirt under his bath robe?\n\nIt may be bad, but there are still several enjoyable moments. One of my favorites is the most obvious - watching Chuck Norris square off against Bill &apos;Superfoot&quot; Wallace. Two legends of the Martial Arts in a fight to the death - good stuff. It almost makes the whole movie worthwhile.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a little more interesting when you know that most of it was improvised with Kiarostami sitting in the driver&apos;s seat talking to the other actors.  But like most purely improvised films, there&apos;s a rather low ratio of insights to the amount of screen time spent struggling to come up with something interesting.  (Actually, only one of the characters really manages to be interesting at all.)  Likewise, some of the shots of Mr. Badii driving around aimlessly have a certain Antonioniesque hypnotic effect, but most of them look no more interesting than random video you might have shot yourself in the industrial part of town.  \n\nThere are critics who call this kind of untouched-by-art realism genius, who say that Kiarostami is making us think, reconsider the very nature of cinema, and so on.  To my mind, the message of the film-- the taste of cherry makes life worth living-- is no more or less profound than, say, Woody Allen rattling off a few of the things that make life worth living in Manhattan, or the epiphany the kid in American Beauty gets from a plastic bag.  (Likewise the message that it&apos;s all only a movie.  Never woulda guessed.)  And critics who find such a message shallow in a piece of slick entertainment, but deep when it&apos;s in a deliberately unentertaining art film, need to reexamine their critical principles, or lighten up a little-- or at least go see again the work of real art Kiarostami alludes to in his title, Wild Strawberries, which has more depth of characterization and emotional richness in any five minutes than this manages to scrounge up in an hour and a half."

The cinematography is brilliant, the acting is great (remember this was 1976 Australia) - especially from child actor Greg Rowe (who is now all grown up and living with his wife and two kids in Canada). David Gulpilil also provides a wandering Aboriginal man mysticism to the film and he looks quite younger than in Australia but it&apos;s like he is playing the same character. A character well suited to him. The area in which it is set is just beautiful and while Storm Boy battles with his needs to see the greater world and gain an education - all I wanted to do when watching was to swap places with him. The film supplies a lot of themes about nurturing, growing, the circle of life (thankyou Lion King), isolation, friendship and the morality of right and wrong. The battle between life in general and the life the rest of the population says we should be living. \n\nThe film is funny at times, touching, sad and inspiring and will make you want a pet pelican!!!\n\nTry and get to see this one - I know Target has them for $7- and you can probably pick up at most places for same price - or rent it. One disappointing thing about it - the DVD is a straight copy of an older print - it is not remastered, but somehow to me this added to it&apos;s age and quality - like a fine port on film.",

A stencil on Depardieu&apos;s wall asks &quot;Why?!&quot; and that&apos;s a good question. Although composed of several interesting elements (some of which recall Ferreri&apos;s earlier THE SEED OF MAN) it doesn&apos;t gel into any cohesive whole. The best I can do at putting it together is to say it&apos;s an absurdist treatise on the decline of civilization, but not all the pieces seem to fit. It&apos;s an exercise in non-sequitur, and that&apos;s not a form I enjoy very much unless it&apos;s done very light-heartedly. There are amusing moments but the overall tempo is too sluggish. Also, the performances aren&apos;t very good except for Depardieu and Mastroianni, and even they don&apos;t appear to understand what they&apos;re doing. Sometimes Ferreri&apos;s idiosyncrasies add up to something really exciting, but here it&apos;s a near miss.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s truly amazing how much life that this &quot;Leprechaun&quot; series has had. It&apos;s endured for over 20 years; there&apos;s even a remake in the works. Then again, I suppose there&apos;s something to be said for this kind of dumb fun. And make no mistake, it *is* dumb. But it&apos;s also genuinely funny at times, and is not without a clever moment or two. The makers of these movies know that they&apos;re not making Shakespeare, and create agreeable horror comedies that may have some viewers groaning, shaking their heads, and struggling to get through them, and others having a fine old time. Making a difference is star Warwick Davis (it is nice to have seen him so gainfully employed), whose enthusiasm is hard to resist. He&apos;s obviously enjoying himself.\n\nIn his second performance as the gleefully sadistic Leprechaun, he attempts to snag himself a hot young wife. But his slave interferes (the girl that the Leprechaun selects is his daughter), and 1,000 years later the Leprechaun resurfaces to amorously pursue his slaves&apos; descendant, a girl named Bridget (sexy blonde Shevonne Durkin). Naturally, Bridgets&apos; boyfriend Cody (Charlie Heath) isn&apos;t going to sit idly by and watch a demented fairy take his lady away. So Cody teams up with his irrepressible drunken uncle Morty (veteran comedian Sandy Baron) to do battle.\n\nBaron is a real scene stealer, and in addition to the attractiveness of co-star Durkin and the performance of Davis, does provide some justification for sitting down to watch this. The movie does get tiresome at times - and, for something running just under 85 minutes, it does drag a little - but it&apos;s amusing often enough to make for decent entertainment. At the very least, it does find the time to feature cameo appearances by the legendary Clint Howard and Kimmy Robertson of &quot;The Last American Virgin&quot; and &apos;Twin Peaks&apos; as a pair of tourists. Also showing up are Al White (one of the jive talking dudes from &quot;Airplane!&quot;), Tony Cox (&quot;Bad Santa&quot;), and Billy Beck (&quot;The Blob&quot; &apos;88). Production design, lighting, and visual effects are good, but there won&apos;t be enough gore for some tastes, especially considering the fate of one character. The music by Jonathan Elias is actually damn good.\n\nThis is about as enjoyable as any movie titled &quot;Leprechaun 2&quot; could be.\n\nFive out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Man, I love the Tremors-franchise like Winnie the Pooh loves his honey! After four films and a TV-series (which regretfully didn&apos;t got aired in my country), I still think these giant underground worms are the total definition of coolness! And therefore, I really feel like this entry is made for me and homogeneous souls exclusively. If you think the original Tremors was one of the most entertaining monster comedies ever made, and you even got hooked on the sequelsyou&apos;ll certainly have a great time while watching this fourth installment. If you thought Tremors was only so-so and the sequels atrociouswell then, you&apos;ll absolutely loath number 4 as well. Which is fine by me too but don&apos;t go bashing it then, neither.\n\n I think the Tremors-series depends on one major advantage Every chapter in the series is put together by more or less the same film crew. Brent Maddock and S.S. Wilson are the creative thinkers behind the idea ever since the first film. And each and every single time, they try to uphold the originality aspects and add some ingenious twists to the nature of these lovely monsters. The first three episodes, for example, describe the Graboid&apos;s entire reproduction cycle. Tremors 4 actually is a prequel and takes us back to the Wild West, Nevada 1889. Michael Gross, the trigger-happy hero from all the previous entries stars as his own ancestor who&apos;s the owner of a Silver mine. Hiram Gummer has the exact opposite character of his great grandson at first, but you can slowly see his personality forming itself. The idea and structure of Tremors 4 is pretty risky, but I think it works and true fans will have a great time searching for the numerous references towards later adventures. Enjoy!!",

Several clips show him working on pieces that later became famous; these are compelling moments.\n\nNow, the bad:  The packaging opens with the claim, &quot;The film presents Dali&apos;s entire oeuvre...&quot;  which isn&apos;t true in any sense.  I purchased the DVD believing that I would be able to examine many of his finished pieces, which is not the case.  There is very little work shown at all, &amp; the few works that are featured aren&apos;t formatted or indexed in any useful manner, assuming that they are examinable at all.  I&apos;ll have to stick to the print books, for now.\n\nInteresting for fans, but not memorable.\n\n-r"

      "reviewBody": "Be Like Others by Tanaz Eshaghian, USA/Canada/Iran (Documentary - International Premiere). Iranian men undergoing sex-change operations.\n\n&quot;You are unusual creatures, but completely normal.&quot; Thus a surgeon begins his consultation with a young Iranian man seeking a sex-change operation to love his boyfriend safely, as a woman. In the Islamic Republic of Iran. homosexuality is punishable by death. Twenty-five years ago, however, the Ayatollah Khomeini wrote a fatwa pronouncing transsexuality legal and allowing for sex-change operations. Pure logic - nothing in the Koran specifically forbids the surgery.\n\nThe operation is difficult, even brutal, according to a surgeon - a section of intestine is removed to fashion a vagina (chosen for texture and lubricating potential). Afterwards, the patient receives a new birth certificate with her new gender.\n\nDifficulties extend into the ethical/moral sphere. Is society forcing these people to have an operation, as a rescue from a judgment of homosexuality? Doctors, Koranic experts, and patients offer their perspectives on the sense and apparent contradictions of the policy and practice.\n\nBefore surgery, one man explains his situation:\n\n&quot;If I didn&apos;t live in Iran, I wouldn&apos;t touch God&apos;s work.&quot; In the end, some of the patients are abandoned by boyfriends and family, and make money consummating temporary marriages - in essence, sanctioned prostitution. &quot;I have killed love in my being,&quot; says one, expressing a deep regret in exile, shunned by parents and without a proper place in society.\n\nWith an American and Iranian passport, Eshaghian had great freedom to film and produce this document. No one in the government reviewed the tapes or the finished film. She is no ideologue - just a smart and compassionate documentarian.\n\nWinner of the Teddy Jury Award.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Big Street&quot; was not a major hit when first released but the critics at the time all noted Lucille Ball&apos;s superb star-making performance as one of the all-time nastiest women ever to reach the big screen. Lucy was already a minor star thanks to a string of popular B-grade comedies and dramas but this film cemented her stardom and brought her to MGM where she reached an early peak the next year. The film is sentimental and does have some plot points that have to be swallowed but Ball&apos;s great acting and chemistry with a splendid Fonda makes this tale of unrequited love work. Fonda plays a kind innocent busboy who falls madly in-love with a crippled chanteuse(Ball). The last scene on the dance floor is unforgettable. Why RKO did not get Lucy an Oscar nomination for this performance is a crime. All the critics at the time hailed her work in this but it just slipped under the rug when the film posted only small profits. This was the kind of role Bette Davis made her own but Ball does it without Davis&apos; habit of falling into mannerisms. Agnes Moorehead is also excellent as Fonda&apos;s concerned friend. Beautiful cinematography makes Ball look incredible in her close-ups. Worth a look but overlook the occasional mawkish elements. Lucy makes it a must."

      "reviewBody": "Like Mr. Pierson, I find it strange to give this movie a &quot;10&quot; since it is not something to see for a good time.\n\nWhen I saw this movie in 1972, I considered myself very lucky, since I was from Massachusetts, where it was banned, and saw it only because it was shown in my Psych class in college in New York State. We had a special showing for our class and (literally) were told not to eat before seeing the film.\n\nThere was quite a bit of controversy over it, and over Bridgewater in Massachusetts back then, somehow I just assumed that the film would be available and not banned by now. The ban only protected the state of Massachusetts, really, from being portrayed as a government that ran an prison for the criminally insane where people only went in, and never came out, where prisoners were mistreated, and where the craziest person in the place was the warden. Bridgewater was used as a threat to people at the Charles Street Jail to keep in line, it was considered like a death sentence. Massachusetts probably wasn&apos;t alone, I&apos;ve heard that Napa was used as a threat to people in San Quentin back then as well.\n\nHow strange about it still being restricted, I hadn&apos;t thought of it in a long time and was actually researching hunger strikes when it crossed my mind. I wonder how Bridgewater in the &apos;60s compares to anything now.",

      "reviewBody": "This film seems a bit like a prototype of the films that the great entertainer Caterina Valente would make in the following years for Artur Brauner&apos;s CCC-Film. The plot is based on the comedy operetta &quot;The Happiest Woman in the World - The Pompadour&apos;s Bed&quot; by Kurt Feltz and Max Wallner, music by Fred Raymond. For example, &quot;Come with me to Italy for a while&quot; is sung. The plot is wonderfully inconsequential, but all the stars who would also appear in later Caterina Valente films are involved. Of course, brother Silvio Francesco, Rudolf Vogel, Helen Vita and Dietmar Schönherr as the smart boy of hearts. Special casts promise full-blooded entertainer Peter Alexander (who unfortunately remains a bit pale) and the later quiz master Hans Joachim Kulenkampff (Einer wird gewinnen) as the revue&apos;s impresario.\n\nIt is also interesting that the film was produced by Alfred Greven in a studio in Wiesbaden, who was already very successful during the UFA era and then became infamous through his work for the Continental in Paris (studios in Boulogne Billancourt). If you are interested in this time, the film &quot;The Passierschein / Laissez-Passer&quot; by Bertrand Tavernier is strongly recommended.\n\nBut back to the undisputed star of the film, which - unlike the ones produced by Brauner - still seems very playful and almost like an experimental film.\n\nCaterina Valente is now 93 years old. The German-speaking film community should definitely not forget that it had and still has such a star in its ranks!!!",

Suspiciously, the local lighthouse keeper has been feeding meat scraps to a certain big-clawed creature. Keeping his secret becomes increasingly difficult as the body count rises.\n\nUpon watching this movie again, it&apos;s interesting to notice the subtle influences it has had on other films, such as JAWS and THE FOG. It&apos;s also pretty grim and graphic for a monster movie from the late 1950&apos;s. Overall, the movie is very effective. The finale at the lighthouse is certainly memorable.\n\nCo-stars Don Sullivan (THE GIANT GILA MONSTER, TEENAGE ZOMBIES) as Fred and Les Tremayne (WAR OF THE WORLDS, THE SLIME PEOPLE) as Dr. Jorgenson."

      "reviewBody": "Spiral is a well-acted, intense thriller about a lonely, delusional young man trying to overcome his powerful inner demons. In the starring role of Mason, Joel Moore effectively plays a telephone salesperson whose feelings of anxiety and confusion are intertwined with disturbing flashbacks of his former girlfriend. Mason cringes from most of society. His boss (played by Zachary Levi), an arrogant womanizer who knows the circumstances of Mason&apos;s tragic past, is his only friend. Gradually, however, Mason builds a relationship with a young female co-worker (played by Amber Tamblyn) who brings out his confidence by encouraging his artistic talents. Yet, Mason&apos;s feelings of dread and paranoia are never far away. In fact, deciphering whether Mason&apos;s reality is synonymous with truth kept me spellbound throughout the film. The camera work in Spiral is especially outstanding. Sudden, vivid images from Mason&apos;s memories take the viewer to his level of turmoil and terror. In addition, shooting this movie in the great city of Portland, Oregon was an excellent choice. The gloominess of the rainy winters fit perfectly with the murky shadows of Mason&apos;s mind. The end of the movie has some great twists and surprises for the audience to relish. When all is said and done, Spiral is a wonderfully dark and intense film that holds up to any of today&apos;s big-studio thrillers."

They provided as much entertainment as the other more experienced cast members.\n\nThe most surprising cast member of them all was Russell Brand. I went into the film with a despise of the man and thinking he would ruin the film for me, but he was actually pretty good. \n\nIn all I found St Trinian&apos;s to be a good film and definitely one for teenage girls to watch, but don&apos;t worry if you get dragged along to I guarantee you&apos;ll leave laughing.\n\nDon&apos;t forget to listen the song in the credits!!!",

Theron proves here once more that she is a strong actress with much skill and much more potential. To boot, this has a really great action sequence near the end. A good, entertaining movie, this is a definite watch.\n\n8/10",

      "reviewBody": "An amusing take on the low-budget monster movies of the seventies, this is also a kind of follow-up to the Alligator movies of the early eighties. It wasn&apos;t a success, maybe due to the title - potential viewers may think it&apos;s a documentary about a lake - but is consistently humorous, thanks to a good cast. Fonda, as a paleontologist sent to investigate a sudden death by large teeth on the lake in question, is purposely irritating in the &apos;fish out of water&apos; role. She reveals a surprising knack for comedy, the city girl from New Yawk stuck in the forest. Platt &amp; Gleeson squabble like two long-lost overweight brothers as respectfully, eccentric millionaire &amp; sheriff. Platt is always funny, and Gleeson matches him here. Pullman makes less of an impression, underplaying as the guy in charge. Betty White is a hoot as the foul-mouthed local old lady with a secret.\n\nThe monster in question, a 30-foot croc, stays out of sight for the first half-hour and when it does appear, it&apos;s strangely unsurprising, despite the suddenness. It&apos;s as if we&apos;ve seen so many of these &apos;large animal&apos; pictures by this point, this is just another one in a long line. It&apos;s a weird money shot as well, involving a growling bear, and is not as effective as it should be. Thanks to modern special FX, computer and otherwise, the croc is better realized than those of 20 years earlier. But that could be a problem: integrated into the wilderness like any other animal, there&apos;s nothing about the creature, despite its size, to inspire awe or real terror. It&apos;s just a big crocodile, after all. Like &quot;Anaconda&quot;, this inspired a slew of big croc &amp; alligator movies for the Sci-Fi Channel. UPDATE: Speaking of which, a sequel came out on the SF channel in late April, 2007.",

Some reviewers have focused on the boys or the father or the mother. Different scenes have been noted, almost none by more than one reviewer. What this tells me is that the writer/director has crafted a story in which all of the scenes contribute to the whole. This was my experience watching the movie. It was believable, well shot, great backgrounds, all in all a treat for anyone who loves movies and can handle some pretty raw dialog/situations.....and nothing gets blown up.\n\nI would recommend this only for adults or a very mature teenager. The language and situations are tough but as I said, very believable. I identified with much of what the teens in this movie are going through and my sympathies definitely sided with them against their self-involved and self-indulgent parents. This is the best role I&apos;ve ever seen Jeff Daniels in and having known men in my life like his character I think he was spot-on with his portrayal. There were no weak characterizations with any of the actors, for that matter.",

But when a gifted mysterious Dr. Agatha Webb (Lindsay Duncan) manages to find a donor to have a new arm for Bill. When his wife Karen (Kim Delaney) agrees with the doctor for the operation. When the operation is a success and then its takes weeks for Bill&apos;s new arm to be working. In fact, he finds his new arm to be much better than his old one. But then, it&apos;s starts doing things that he doesn&apos;t want to do and being having vivid nightmares. He finds out that his arm belongs to Charley Fletcher (John Walsh). A violent serial killer, who got executed on the operation table. When Bill got his new arm from. But Bill finds out that he&apos;s not the only one, who got spear parts from the infamous murderer. Then after meeting two people (Brad Dourif and Peter Murnik), who got spear body parts from Charley. But when Bill wants his arm off, the Dr. Webb refused to do it. Bill has a feeling or two that Dr. Webb is not what she seems to be and he feels, there&apos;s something out there is coming for him.\n\nDirected by Eric Red (Bad Moon, Cohen and Tate, Undertow) made an intriguing horror film with some effective moments of suspense and thrills. This was an box office disappointment, when it was released in the summer of 1991. The critics were not kind to this movie as well. Sure, the premise isn&apos;t original anymore. But director Red tries to make something different here by adding some neat ideals to the already often filmed premise of the picture. The underrated Fahey gives an strong performance. Dourif gives an memorable small role as the artist, who finds sudden success with his paintings. Red does his best work so far as a filmmaker here. Red wasn&apos;t made a movie or wrote a script in years but it seems, he trying to make a comeback with his latest work &quot;100 Feet&quot;. That film will be released sometime in 2008. Like most of Red&apos;s works, &quot;Body Parts&quot; has become a cult classic. It&apos;s certainly one of the most underrated horror movies of the 1990&apos;s. Effective music score by Loek Dikker. Insipred from the novel &quot;Choice Cuts&quot; by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac (Which they wrote the classic book together &quot;Diabolique&quot;). Co-scripted by the director and Norman Snider (Dead Ringers, Rated X). Screen-story by Patricia Herskovic (Producer of cult classics like &quot;Deadly Blessing&quot;, &quot;Mother&apos;s Boys&quot; and &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;) and Joyce Taylor. Don&apos;t miss it.

      "reviewBody": "Marco Bellochio pays homage in this film to the Gallic novelistic methods that he favours, particularly those depicting a primal life force, in this three part ethological drama co-scripted by the director and his defrocked psychoanalyst friend Massimo Fagioli, a cinematic triumph that displays a notable admixture of style and purpose as it reflects upon a trenchant formation of cause and effect: the psychology of sex, utilizing formal design in addition to surrealist imagery within mundane settings that few auteurs can match. Sandra Celestini (Claire Nebout) is touring the Farnese Castle gallery, near Viterbo, with her classmates under the aegis of their art professor, and when she has apparently lost keys to her apartment, she separates from the group in order to locate them and is subsequently locked inside, therefore preparing to wait for the morrow, when she discovers that she is not alone in the Castle, because Lorenzo Colajanni (Vittorio Mezzogiorno), an architect, is in for the evening. It soon becomes apparent that Sandra is about to be sexually assaulted by her new companion, their unplanned intimacy being exquisitely choreographed. When Lorenzo tells Sandra that he has in his possession the keys to the Castle, and that the two could have left the premises at any time, part one abruptly ends with part two taking place in a courtroom where Colajanni is being tried for rape of Sandra, an event marked by dialogue that concerns purely theoretical aspects of the Castle episode, i.e., was the lovemaking a result of coercion or rather shared passion?; indeed, how can force be defined during sexual contact?; is female sexual response released by an innate desire to be forcefully taken? This is plainly a subject designed for spirited controversy, but the juridical proceedings are mirrored by the troubled psychosexual private life of the case&apos;s prosecuting attorney, Giovanni (Andrzej Seweryn), forming the marrow of part three, depicting a philosophical choice to be made between temptation and coercion that haunts the relationship of Giovanni with his dissatisfied mistress. Although clues to clear resolution of these perennial conflicts will be sought by some viewers, the cardinal value of the film results from Bellochio&apos;s surehanded and ever fluid directorial craft, as his gliding camera provides ongoing surprises throughout this visually splendid motion picture that energizes both mind and eye, with rich contributions coming from Mirco Garrone and his crisp editing, Giuseppe Lanci, cinematographer, and Carlo Crivelli for his illustrative score, while acting honours here go to Nebout for her striking performance as Sandra.",

After a try to suicide, his new therapist Lisa (Regula Grauwiller, &quot;Kurz und schmerzlos&quot;) promises to bring him up - together with social worker Martin (Max Herbrechter), two mentally handicapped and three guys from jail (for rehabilitation). Absolutely different people collide and have to grow together in an extreme situation. It seems to be an impossible journey with an uncertain ending.

The lack of budget is, I am sure what prevented them from filming the novels ending. For a small budget however, it was a well done film.",

      "reviewBody": "Not among French director Michel Deville&apos;s finest achievements BENJAMIN remains what Graham Greene used to call (not derisively) &quot;an entertainment&quot; -quality for the mainstream moviegoer. Through the vagaries of film distribution (and flighty popular tastes) it has fallen into obscurity.\n\nAs indicated in its English title, film is bookended by passages read from the title hero&apos;s diary. As played by Pierre Clémenti (an icon of European decadent &amp; avant garde cinema, here cast against type as an innocent), he&apos;s an orphan going with his loyal tutor Camille (Jacques Dufilho) to live with his aunt, the countess (radiant superstar of the &apos;40s Michèle Morgan).\n\nHis adventures with the aristocracy are limned in the familiar &quot;naughty but nice&quot; style that served French cinema so well, most emblematically in many Fernandel comedies. Deville and his frequent collaborator, screenwriter &amp; future helmer Nina Companeez, maintain a light and breezy approach that, alas, lacks the substance most film buffs want today.\n\nIt&apos;s all tease, as women of all ages, having in common uncommon beauty, can&apos;t keep their hands off Benjamin. The film was a major Paramount release, debuting in NYC at the prestigious Paris Theatre and rated X (a MIDNIGHT COWBOY-type X, not porn) for its sexual attitudes rather than any explicitness. The nudity common in Adult Cinema at the time is eschewed.\n\nStandout performances are by Michel Piccoli, perfectly cast as the countess&apos;s lover, who boasts about his other mistresses and is sympathetic due to the actor&apos;s skills more than the writing or context. With so many fancily costumed and straining-at-bodice femmes in the cast Catherine Deneuve has no trouble standing out as Benjamin&apos;s ultimate love interest. Especially fun is her character&apos;s flightiness, given always witty lines as an invariable liar who makes sport of her constantly contradictory statements.\n\nClémenti is less successful in the central role, at times fading into the shrubbery with such striking and bombastic co-stars pleasantly chewing up the scenery. Having already co-starred opposite Deneuve in her triumphant BELLE DE JOUR, he was better suited to decadent or even malevolent roles with the good fortune to be cast over and over again by the leading directors of the time: Bertolucci, Pasolini, Bunuel, Jancso, Makavejev and Glauber Rocha {reads like a film festival program of the late &apos;60s}.\n\nOther delights include an amusing wardrobe malfunction at a garden party scene, where the countess&apos;s sort-of-loyal servant Anna Gael accidentally has a nipple popping out of her dress, but calmly adjusts her bodice without missing a beat, the take playing out and left in the final print -very cute. Catherine Rouvel, a stalwart of French eroticism, is unfortunately lost in the shuffle as another servant girl.\n\nPiccoli sums up the tone with a great line (in the English-dubbed version at any rate) to Benjamin: &quot;What you call debauchery I call education&quot;. Lacking the depth of his all-time best role in Rivette&apos;s LA BELLE NOISEUESE, BENJAMIN does stand as testament to Piccoli&apos;s place in history as one of cinema&apos;s essential thesps.\n\nI waited over 40 years to see BENJAMIN, so was of course slightly disappointed by its lack of substance -got my hopes up too much. The Hollywood majors relied heavily in the &apos;60s on foreign imports, both co-productions and pickups, to fill out their release schedules, but rights in these movies (as well as residual interest) have lapsed over the years. That&apos;s why a quality film like BENJAMIN has seen no American TV or video exposure since its initial release.\n\nEnglish-language print I viewed (via VSOM DVD) ran 103 minutes, contrary to the IMDb listing of a much shorter U.S. running time."

He also outwits the greatest minds of the era to have his Assumption Bill passed, which will establish the credit of the nation. In these efforts he is opposed by Dudley Digges, who will stick at naught in his efforts to stop it for happening because.... ah, because..... well, because he is the villain of the piece. Boo! Hiss!\n\nThis is the weakest of Arliss&apos;s movies, and I found it rather dull. Students of our history and fans of Lin-Manuel Miranda may understand what the fuss is about. Anyone coming fresh to this movie will find it as much a mystery as the reasons for those who oppose it -- &quot;It is against our principles&quot; says one character. What those principles are is never mentioned. Perhaps it&apos;s a deep-seated belief that anyone fool enough to lend you money should never get paid. Likewise, those who enjoy Arliss&apos; historical turns because of his sly wit and good humor will be disappointed. Instead,we are subjected to speeches, from Alan Mowbray bidding the troops farewell, to Arliss&apos; curtain speech on finding they&apos;ve passed the bill. It is then we recall that Arliss was a 19th-century actor, a period when declaiming your love of mother at the top of your lungs was much admired. Arliss doesn&apos;t rattle the rafters, but the thinking man or woman will be left befuddled at the lack of linkages. The &apos;oi polloi will cheer at the playing of &quot;Yankee Doodle.&quot; With Doris Kenyon, June Collyer, Montagu Love, and Lionel Belmore.",

In fact it wasn&apos;t as bad as most of the Horror films Hollywood has released recently. The killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most instances just that, original. The cast was mediocre which is to be expected from low-budget features but much better than what that much bigger studio Artisan/Lions Gate has been offering. My only real complaint that wasn&apos;t due to the film&apos;s budget, which must have been small, was the contrived &quot;twist&quot; ending. I&apos;m sorry but this is what put this film in the bad category for me. The ending was just stupid and tacked on. Before that I was a little bored, but actually enjoying it. 4/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Charade&quot; is a film who&apos;s great appeal rests in two things. Extremely charismatic leads, and a light, effervescent early 60&apos;s atmosphere. It&apos;s Hitchcock (very very) light with a plot that largely serves to get the leads interacting.\n\nI don&apos;t think it&apos;s impossible to remake. The plot is light enough to be used in different contexts. But you need two leads with powerful charisma and ... I would suggest ... you need to completely break the association with the early 60&apos;s and create an entirely new setting for this story.\n\nJonathan Demme&apos;s remake fails on both points. Thandie Newton does have a lot of charisma. She didn&apos;t have the really radiant star power that Audrey Hepburn had in 1963, but she is more than up to the task. She&apos;s really the only thing about this film that works.\n\nNot so with Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg can be great (&quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot;), but he&apos;s a limited actor who needs to be used well. He&apos;s not a fount of charisma. Given his clearly suspicious behavior in this film, you can never accept that Newton just follows him unquestioningly.\n\nDemme makes the really strange decision to repeatedly reference the French New Wave in this film. There are clips from &quot;Shoot the Piano Player&quot; and Charles Aznavour, Anna Karina and Agnes Varda all have cameos. This is weird not only because &quot;Charade&quot; is clearly a very different beast from the French New Wave, but also it awkwardly ties this film back to the first film&apos;s era without invoking anything that&apos;s appealing about that film.\n\nThis film just doesn&apos;t work. I think the first act is passable, but the film falls completely apart. Continuing the New Wave references, Demme shoots this in a very loose, hand-held style that really just serves to render any attempts at suspense completely ineffective.\n\nI don&apos;t know what Tim Robbins thinks he&apos;s doing in this film, but he&apos;s truly awful.",

      "reviewBody": "Sihung Lung, the actor who played Master Chu, the aging tai chi master, gave a very convincing and sincere performance in this film. It was no wonder that he won the Golden Horse (Taiwan&apos;s equivalent for the Oscars) for Best Actor in this film. His performance was extremely touching, as tears jerked into my eyes as I see an aging and traditional Chinese father trying to get along with his westernized family while also trying to adjust to life in a new place and culture. The film encourages people, especially new immigrants, to emphasize and put themselves in their parents&apos; shoes. Try to understand how difficult it is for them to come and settle in a new place and try not to push them away. Be patient with them, take a step back and everything may be better.\n\nThe movie title, &quot;Pushing Hands&quot;, is very appropriate, as this is the term for an exercise in tai chi in which a person achieves balance by giving up balance. In this non-aggressive exercise between 2 people, a person offers no resistance at all to the pressure or push that the other person is exerting and keeps borrowing this strength until they feel they have fused into one and thus have achieved harmony. This was what Master Chu did. Although his daughter-in-law kept misunderstanding him, causing much discontent and eventually got his son to try to sent him away, he offered no resentment or a temper tantrum. He simply walked away gracefully. This action caused his son to appreciate him and remember why he got his father to live together in the first place in a tear jerking scene and finally they worked out a solution. They decided to give each other space by living separately instead of pushing each other away. In the end everyone was much happier, as even the daughter-in-law learned to accept the father, symbolized by her decorating the guest room for him and asking the question if he would ever visit. The father achieved the balance that he seek in Tai-Chi.\n\nAng Li is simply amazing and sensational. He did what he could with the limited budget and created a very warm and tear jerking film. Although this film was not the highest quality (the version I saw was very unclear and skips sometimes) and it could feel slow at times, especially the beginning sequence, the film was a great work in directing. The film picked up its pace after the slow beginning without any big fighting scenes or explosions and never felt boring afterwards. Also, from the beginning sequence, where he was able to show the dissension and gap between the daughter-in-law and the father by using just different scenes and visuals, to scenes throughout the film where he used lighting and different camera angles to show the internal pain and sadness that the father experience, it was, simply put, a great piece of art considering the budget. It showcased the talent of Li and gave the audience a glimpse of the man who would bring us the memorable Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."

      "reviewBody": "A The Muppet Christmas Carol is the Muppet&apos;s take on the classic tale of Ebenezer Scrooge, a selfish old man who cares nothing for anyone but himself, until on Christmas Eve he is visited by three spirits, telling him to change his ways. This is a well done version of the story, and it is the only Muppet movie I can look at as a real movie, rather than a movie starring Muppets.\n\nThe way the story is told in this movie is done really well. Having Gonzo play Charles Dickens as he narrates the story was a smart move. It adds more humour to the story. The different characters that Muppets pop up as are genius, for instance, changing Fuzzywig to Fozziewig so Fozzie Bear could play him. Also, the movie manages to remain dark like the story should be, while also staying tame for kids.\n\nMicahel Caine is great as Ebenezer Scrooge. He&apos;s actually one of the best Scrooge&apos;s I&apos;ve seen. It really speaks for his acting talent when he is able to talk and react to Muppets like they&apos;re people.\n\nOverall, this is a classic children&apos;s film, and is probably one of the best versions of the classic tale on screen.\n\n8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Sam Katzman and William Beaudine are two of the immortals of Poverty Row,and Voodoo Man is the literal definition the of the movie that is sooo bad that it&apos;s a great picture.Katzman&apos;s Banner Productions filmed Voodoo Man in 7 days in October of 1943 for Monogram Studios.What sets this apart is the appearance of Bela Lugosi, George Zucco, and John Carradine in the lead roles and all three are at their rip roarin&apos;, hammiest, and over the top best in this little horror opus.Beaudine was the acknowledged master of turning out &quot;Economical&quot; but extremely watchable B movies.\n\nLugosi is the sinister doctor who is channeling Snidely Whiplash. He would twirl his mustache if he had one and yell&quot;curses, foiled again&quot; at every setback. Zucco is a gas station manager and voodoo high priest who scouts out young ladies and potential victims for the doctor and chants an unrecognizable gibberish in the background much of the time. during the transference ceremony. Carradine portrays Lugosi&apos;s dimwitted gofer and bongo drum player. In a lesser actors hands the role would be a total embarrassment but Carridine is able to sell it.The scene where Carridine gets a closeup playing the bongo is so over the top that it is classical. His character really believes in the magic of the ceremony. \n\nMicheal Ames AKA Tod Andrews, Wanda McKay,and Louise Currie do a commendable job with their roles, particularly Currie whose character is forced through the voodoo ceremony then wanders the countryside in a zombie like state while wearing flimsy and very sexy nightgown. McKay was a Paramount contract actress who did a lot of screen work for Monogram during the 1940&apos;s.Currie was another talented actress who did a lot of work at the B studios in the 1940&apos;s. She had worked with Lugosi before in the Ape Man for Monogram.\n\nThe plot of Voodoo Man is less important then getting to watch Lugosi, Zucco, and Carridine go through their paces. They could make reading the ingredients to a can of soup sinister fun!Sam Katzman would would have probably made a feature film of them doing it if he had thought of it. With Beaudine directing of course!",

The movie was made for entertainment purposes and showed great battle scenes as like those in the days of yesteryear. It didn&apos;t claim to be a docudrama, for those who want the correct history i&apos;m sure there&apos;s plenty of material out there for those. To me as long as it was close to the actual events of it&apos;s time, which it was, that&apos;s good enough for me. So many other movies like the latest version of &quot;The Alamo&quot; had a lot of correct history but also showed things that no one could really verify like Davey Crockett yelling at Santa Anna commenting how short he was and before they murdered him he warned them he was a screamer.Fact or Hollywood? Just take Augustus for what it is and enjoy this epic with great battle scenes and done in the same manner as past greats like &quot;Ben Hur&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. I think you&apos;ll enjoy it much better this way. You can always go to the library or get the actual facts later. Take it for what it is, an entertaining movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect when I went to see Talentime, and I think neither did any of the other nine people who went to see it with me. I&apos;d seen Sepet and Gubra, and good as they were, they felt very raw and unpolished. Talentime retreads a number of themes and tales which Yasmin Ahmad dealt with in her earlier films, so it wasn&apos;t immediately clear what would set Talentime apart.\n\nWhen the credits began rolling, all of us -- and virtually the rest of the theatre -- stood or sat in stunned silence. This is one of the most heartwrenching, moving movies I have ever watched -- and especially so for Malaysians.\n\nI do have some bones to pick with the film. I felt the editing was a bit choppy at times, and the dubbing seemed rather poor. Once or twice, parts of the story strained credulity for me.\n\nIn spite of these things, Talentime deserves a 10. It tells a good story well. It resists the temptation to overreach in terms of subject matter, and it avoids the problematic, blunt moralising which often characterises the approach to problems like race and love.\n\nWhen the group I watched Talentime with finally picked our jaws up off the floor, we raved about the final scene. It&apos;s something which I think most people have seen before -- a bittersweet, almost preachy scene that&apos;s always mawkish and off-putting. But Yasmin Ahmad somehow pulls it off -- it&apos;s one of the most moving things I&apos;ve ever seen on the silver screen.\n\nIt&apos;s very sad that Yasmin Ahmad is no longer with us. Talentime was her masterpiece, and it shows a maturity and polished refinement which her earlier works lacked. This should be mandatory viewing for any Malaysian.",

It imagines a world that never occurred. It claims that by 2010, half of US homes are wired for virtual reality broadcasts. Didn&apos;t happen, of course. It also imagines a world where sex is regulated and controlled by refugees from a Huckabee For President committee and the Westboro Baptist Church. Again, a laughable premise.\n\nThe acting is horrific. The cast was obviously going through the motions. They must have needed the work badly.\n\nThe camera work is pedestrian at best. When you get down to it, there are only two reasons to see his film which is available on YouTube. The two reasons? Rochelle Swanson, of course!"

      "reviewBody": "Vittorio de Sica knew his home town Naples by heart, as he, like his favourite actress Sofia Loren, practically had grown up there from the gutter. In these six episodes are reflected different insights and aspects of Napolitan life, reflecting both comedy, tragedy, drama and, as always in de Sica&apos;s films, deep humanity. One of the episodes is dedicated entirely to a funeral procession of a dead child. The most dramatic episode is the fifth with Silvana Mangano getting married to an unknown man, naturally she is shy and feels rather uncertain about the venture, and gradually the whole scheme of the situation unfolds, and she naturally reacts. Her performance is the most memorable in this film. Sophia Loren is still very young here and brilliant as a pizza hostess selling in the streets with her husband and extricating herself magnificently out of a scandal. Vittorio de Sica plays the lead himself in one of the episodes, actually making a satire out of himself, as he was a great gambler himself and needed some detachment and to handle the situation, which this sequence illustrates perfectly. The brilliant comedian Totó introduces the episodes in a very domestic situation of outrageous difficulties and awkwardness, and he manages it in a very Italian way. In brief, these six chapters of daily life in Naples in 1954 will go through to eternity with the rest of de Sica&apos;s films as timeless and ageless expressions of deep sympathy and keen warm-hearted observation.",

      "reviewBody": "Billu Barber, 2009, 138 min, Red Chillies Entertainment An Excerpt \n\nPriyadarshan&apos;s film produced by Gauri Khan, Billu is the story of a small-town humble barber, from a sleepy Indian village who is having a tough time making ends meet with overdue electricity bills and unpaid school tuition when a film star enters his life with an arrival of Sahir Khan, mega star to town for a shoot. Interestingly, a famous larger-than-life star arrives in town for a shoot sending the village into frenzy as they try to catch the glimpse of the mega-star Sahir Khan, played by non-other than Shahrukh Khan. Billu&apos;s poverty-stricken life is contrasted beautifully against the mega star until the face off of the two characters when they finally meet. This is a movie about unconditional childhood friendship, cutting through age, status or fame. At the end, childhood love and friendship heals any wound and bonds broken relationships.\n\nWhat really makes the movie is the character Billu himself, played by Irrfan Khan, surely one of the most talented but underrated actor in Bollywood today. Some of you may remember him from Mira Nair&apos;s film Namesake which he gave superb performances as Gogol&apos;s father as well as the mean police inspector in Slumdog Millionaire. He is the emotional core of this movie. The film starts with his desperate and innocent attempt to bribe a government officer in order to get a business loan for his barber shop. While listening to his plea, you can&apos;t help it but feel for him. Apparently, it is believed that this role was first offered to Ashkay Kumar. I can&apos;t imagine him playing this role. Irrfan brings a certain human dignity and respect not only to the character Billu and his profession but also to the life of poverty, convening so much by saying very little. He manages to make his character extremely believable and likable with ease.\n\nA surprising and refreshing character is Bindiya, Billu&apos;s wife played by Lara Dutt. She should be commended for delivering a captivating and believable performance s; you would not know she is former Miss Universe. This is a different role for her; she usually plays the sophisticated beauty and I might add it is refreshing to see her in this role. The stage presence of both Lara and Irrfan is impressive as husband and wife. She gives the character strength with moments of depth, love and respect which I find very inspiring given their poverty level.\n\nWhat makes this movie great its realism and depiction of rural life in India, unlike other Bollywood movies, with no pretension or smug. The cinematography of this movie is amazing, showcasing the lush of rural India. The simplicity of the film, portrayal of poverty without overwhelming the audience makes this film a delight to watch. I liked the clever way the director unfolds the story. It invites you in, but leaves you to your own considerations as the story progresses. This film lets certain details out when the moments are right, but not before the audience is fully involved in the somber life of small town man. You get the feeling that Billu is lying until the heartwarming climax. Billu is deeply touching not only in details of an ordinary man&apos;s life, but also our shortcomings and our insecurities.\n\nThis film also states that what seems trivial at any given moment in life could be important later on. Besides all this, great acting, thoughtfulness, genuine sincerity, and total emotional honesty are what one can expect from Billu without the loss of a typical grandiose of Bollywood musicals. If you want to see a movie that affirms the meaning of friendship, this is your movie. Billu is extraordinary film in an ordinary town.\n\nMore commentary on Isisbollywood.wordpress.com\n\nRHK, Isisbollywood",

      "reviewBody": "As a 16 year old, it&apos;s safe to say that this obviously is not a film which is aimed at me at all, being based in a retirement home for old musicians where cracking jokes about opera is, you know, hilarious. In fact, the screening I was in was filled with those with white hair. It&apos;s not often that I feel out of place at a cinema, but I on this occasion I did.\n\nQuartet, as you probably know, features a stellar cast of older actors; Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay playing the reunited divorcées with a history; Billy Connolly as a pottering and senile old tenor, cracking double-entendres at every opportunity; and Pauline Collins, who in my opinion steals the show, as the ditzy ex-opera singer. What follows is an unashamedly predictable, but nevertheless solidly crafted and amusing drama that wouldn&apos;t look out of place on a Sunday afternoon TV slot. Minus the f-words, of course. Yes ,you can see its development from a mile off, and it rarely addresses the more serious and harrowing aspects of old-age as Haneke&apos;s &apos;Amour&apos; did, but it&apos;s good natured, well scripted and amusing fun.\n\nIt&apos;s all through the typical rose-tinted, Downton-esque portrayal of Britain that we&apos;re all accustomed to, but with a cast like that and a gentle, sweet story, it&apos;s hard not to be eventually won over by its charm. I had a good time.",

      "reviewBody": "The 1983 3-D Charles Band production &quot;Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn&quot; is pretty damn forgettable and obviously quite low budget but, like many other movies of its kind, it&apos;s not without its cheesy charms. One is simply going to have to be partial to this type of thing to begin with. It&apos;s highly derivative of other sci-fi features that have come before it, and it is undeniably crude. It&apos;s full of nonsense and short on sense. The characters are well defined if not exactly fleshed out (you&apos;re never in much doubt as to who is a good guy and who is a bad guy.) The action is reasonably effective, with well done stunts and explosions, and the special effects do give this the appeal of really good cheese. The most worthy component is the rousing music score by Charles&apos;s brother Richard Band; it deserves to be in a better movie.\n\nStiff, but not completely unlikable, Jeffrey Byron stars as Dogen, a &quot;ranger&quot; in a world of the future who must do battle with the overlord of the title, played by Mike Preston of &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;. Jared-Syn, assisted by his creepy son Baal (R. David Smith), makes life miserable for people such as amiable old miner Aix (Larry Pennell) and his daughter Dhyana (a young and super sexy Kelly Preston). Knowing he needs help, Dogen gets tracking assistance from the weary Rhodes (Tim Thomerson, who easily steals the show). As the story plays out, he must also deal with a cyclopean being named Hurok (Richard Moll).\n\nThe ending to this is quite anticlimactic and disappointing (clearly there were thoughts of making a sequel to this), but getting there provides some degree of fun. If you can turn off your brain for 83 minutes, you should have a good time with this. It never really catches fire (some might even say that it&apos;s dull), but helping to give it some visual buzz, other than the 3- D, are the various desert locations and the cinematography by Mac Ahlberg, who shot many movies like this during the 1980s. Byron is a rather colourless lead, and one may wish that the more charismatic Thomerson were in that role instead. Mike Preston is an amusing villain, and Moll likewise has a real presence on screen, as always. The briefly seen Pennell is endearing, and Kelly Preston offers up a lot of spunk as the imperiled girl, who is set to be sacrificed by Jared-Syn to a great big life-giving crystal.\n\nThis may not be anything great, but it&apos;s not the worst sci-fi adventure you&apos;ll ever see, either.\n\nFive out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Even though both Rod Serling and Ray Bradbury hated this film I did not and I always appreciate thought provoking science fiction. Todays shallow and unimaginative audiences seem to hate a film that makes you think but thats what good sci-fi does. Rod Steiger has his usual commanding performance and he is a bit much at times. Hostile and violent, its hard to feel sympathy for him. Robert Drivas is very good and at times the film belongs to him but these are fleeting moments as its always impossible to upstage Steiger. Claire Bloom is enchanting but I never really bought into her &quot;Siren&quot; character. I did enjoy the 3 stories even though number three was a little weak. I like the fact that this film is trying to be different. Watching Drivas stare at the illustrations (Don&apos;t call them tattoo&apos;s!) and then having the film drift into the story that each design is about to tell him I found very interesting. Its not great narrative but I appreciate the effort to be original. Steiger and Bloom were married at the time and it was the last year of their ten year union. Could they&apos;re problems have spilled out on screen during they&apos;re scenes? Maybe. Not a great film and certainly it wasn&apos;t told in a great way but I do appreciate a film that is thought provoking. Something that todays science fiction films lack completely!",

Singh, Late Mohan Choti and Late Sajjan.\n\nThis movie which is now considered as one of the cult classic of Indian cinema is known for it&apos;s mesmerizing music which is still very much popular among us the masses and is regularly heard of and for it&apos;s impeccable coming timings and above all the great acting by all the characters.\n\nThe movie is based on the life of three brothers who are women hater and plans for lifelong bachelorhood until two of them falls in love and this leads to hilariously funny situations.\n\nActing is superb and Ashok Kumar is a bouquet of talent when it comes to acting, he is one of the most versatile actors Indian cinema has ever produced, Madhubala is an eternal beauty and I always get awestruck whenever she appears on-screen, she is a perfect example of beauty with talent, Kishore Kumar was also fantastic he had got the most screen time and he will always make you giggle, Anoop Kumar never tasted the success like his elder and younger brother but in this movie he was also spot on with his comic timings, K. N. Singh a well known actor mostly portraying Villainous role was superb in his character, Sajjan and Mohan Choti make their presence felt in the movie.\n\nScreenplay is evenly paced and will keep a constant smile on your face with laughter and giggles on regular intervals which is beautifully supported by mesmerizing music. Climax of the movie is funny and predictably good as most of the movies of those era used to have almost the similar endings.\n\nOverall this is a light hearted, feel good comedy movie which can be seen with the entire family. A must watch.",

Rommel (that magnificent SOB) enjoys the sport of sidehacking.  Along comes J.C. who asks Rommel to ride with him on the circuit.  Rommel declines and J.C. goes nuts.   Starts talking about how he loved him, and how he treated Rommel like a brother.   J.C.&apos;s girlfriend comes on to Rommel, and after he turns her down, she calls him an SOB.  Rommel&apos;s girlfriend is killed by J.C. and Rommel enlists the aid of a strong man, a bad joke telling hick, and Nero former emperor of Rome to find J.C.  Well, they find him, Rommel and J.C. tussle and finally someone dies.  The end.  Now, why couldn&apos;t this have happened about fifty minutes earlier?",

It&apos;s up to his father to bring the dream to his son (and also makes a tie with him) by building a team of rejects from that coach and plays exhibition games on a ragtag field...\n\nWell, we hear a lot of references from 1969: the Expos first games, Bill Stoneman&apos;s no-hitter, the first man on the Moon, Woodstock, the Manson murders and so on...\n\nA very interesting movie for baseball fans and 1969 nostalgia...",

Well, after watching it, I must agree with the most, and I must say the only nice thing in this movie is the ass of Erika Szabó. Üvegtigris 3 has tried to be too popular, thus losing the genuine and identical atmosphere presented in the first part of the trilogy.\n\nThe characters well known from the previous parts were overacted, the dialogs were rigid. It was all about clumsy idiots, and not about the weird stuff happening with ordinary people. The spice-like bittersweet feeling of the Hungarian casual lifestyle was gone, and the poor loser&apos;s disadvantages came to the place. Well you know the difference between funny and pathetic.\n\nHow could I describe... the whole taste was synthetic and the feel of this &quot;I-will-be-funny-or-die-trying&quot; was awful. Despite that I have no regrets about watching it; Erika is _really_ a jewel for the eyes. That&apos; all.",

This is what this brutally honest film asks as a train full of prisoners is left stranded in a small German village.  The townsfolk must decide whether to help them or ignore them.  Their individual soul-searching is the meat of the film - and the conclusion is staggeringly powerful.\n\nWell photographed and with haunting music, this film will stay with you long after it finishes.  Performances are excellent and the direction strong.  My only quibble is that sometimes the little melodramas of the characters (infidelities etc) seem too trivial, in the context of the suffering on the rail carriages, to hold our interest.  Nonetheless I applaud the honesty of the German film-makers to take such an uncompromising look at their own history.",

In-between, lots of confusions and funny situations with the monsters. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Hotel Transilvânia 3: Férias Monstruosas!&quot; (&quot;Hotel Transylvania 3: Monstrous Vacation&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "We always talk about the great Indian treasure we have in the form of literature but when it comes to adapting them for films for mass consumption, everybody for some strange reason adopted a ridiculous view that this cannot be commercially viable proposition. Paheli, here not only comes as a whiff of fresh air by being original but also as a tight slap on the face of all such advocates of escapist, masala cinema. Also its not an easy cake-walk for those &quot;Hollywood (now even other world cinema) DVDs-inspired fools&quot;. Three cheers to Shahrukh for he took a great leap by lending his hands to this film by not just acting in it but also producing it. (Never mind if he is competing with fellow actor Aamir who produced &quot;Lagaan&apos;). Based on book by Vijay Dan Detha, (it was adapted way back in 1973 by Director Mani Kaul for his film-Duvidha) it has captured everything with grandeur. Is it superfluous or sumptuous? May be to an extent but definitely it did not look like a patch as in cases of our Devdases and Blacks. The mind blowing Art Direction (Munish Sappel), Exotic Locations, Costumes (Shalini Sarna), Jewellery (Tanishq), everything falls seamlessly into place. Cinematography (Ravi K. Chandran) and Visual Efx (Eagle Video Films-Prime Focus) is first rate. The sequence where a ghost morphs into a Crow and then to a Squirrel, followed by a bird and finally a Man is mesmerizing. Rani Mukherji and Mr. Bachchan (in Cameo) are competent as usual. Amol Palekar, the director always delivers, never disappoints and same is the case here in his Ninth Film To top it not only he crafted an aesthetic, wonderful fairy-tale looking folklore but also manages his lead actor to perform wisely within the periphery of character, without going over the top. Look at the different number of expressions Shahrukh has given every time while mumbling same line-&quot;Phal..Phool Gulabjal&quot;. No doubt a rare achievement. . It has some minus points too; the camel race is not shot well. May be it is difficult to capture and is also redundant. Sequence could have been shorter. Rajpal Yadav&apos;s Character is completely unnecessary and could have been avoided. Also can somebody please tell him not to play to the gallery for &apos;N&apos;th time? Sub plot of Juhi Chawla and Suneil Shetty also has nothing to contribute to the narrative. Songs are too many and mostly out of situation. Also the drama quotient in climax is low, it could have been treated with more impact. Narrative of whole film would be more interesting if they played on subtle humor throughout the film. Nevertheless, all these come across as minor flaws. A word of advice for Shahrukh, stick to such cinema rather than doing those mindless NRI romances, as you will gradually find a rather larger audience never mind if it takes another 2-3 attempts. All in all, in one word the whole viewing experience can be described as &quot;Phenomenal&quot;.",

The rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) is broken and needs the money to save his cattle and support his family and accepts the assignment. During their journey, Dan saves the life of Ben when a vigilante tries to execute the criminal. Meanwhile Ben&apos;s gang split to find where Ben is and then rescues their boss. When they find that Ben is trapped in a hotel room, they put the place under siege and Dan can not find any man to help him.\n\n&quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; is a classic western from a wonderful time when honor was an important value in a film and even outlaws could have a code of honor. In the present days, it would be hard to believe why Dan Evans is incorruptible and does not accept Ben&apos;s bribe. Glenn Ford performs a charismatic outlaw and the moral duel with Van Heflin&apos;s character is fantastic. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Galante e Sanguinário&quot; (&quot;Gallant and Bloodthirsty&quot;)",

This is the type of movie that needs to be seen in the theatre to get the full experience.\n\nSimilar to Metalica: Some Kind of Monster, this film goes beyond the usual formulaic making of an album film, and into what happens when the real world intrudes into these insular lives.",

      "reviewBody": "This is an amazing story, apparently originated by Lamartine, &quot;Genevieve&quot;, but here it is turned into a typical Matarazzo film full of pathos, suffering, atrocious ordeals and great human endurance under impossible and sometimes inhuman conditions, leading to injustice, incarceration, and no end to human tribulations. Francoise Rosay is impressingly magnificent as the grandmother who has to send her favourite grandson to Buenos Aires to conceal his roguery in making a poor young girl pregnant, who then leaves a son and dies. Her sister has to take care of the baby and is charged and sentenced for having tried to do away with it, and that&apos;s the drama. The most interesting scene is perhaps the wedding, when she (Yvonne Sanson) and her lover in Canada (Amedeo. Nazzari) separated by the Atlantic, nevertheless carry through their wedding, a regular Catholic wedding, and they actually never separate although they try to. It&apos;s a deeply fascinating and moving story finding new ways of developing its great emotional pathos all the time, and the end is the greatest surprise of all. Yvonne Sanspn was never more beautiful, Amedeo Nazzari was never more likeable in eloquently restricted delicacy, and Raffaello Matarazzo probably never made a more romantic film.",

      "reviewBody": "Fans need to know there are three edits of this movie. Another possible title is &quot;Cub Tiger from Kwantung.&quot; Other than that there is no way of knowing which one you have by looking at the box or titles. You have one chance in three of getting the one that is not that bad and two chances in three of getting the stinkers. If I could do video editing I could put together a fourth version that would be as good as any Jackie Chan movie (without needing any additional scenes). If there&apos;s a guy with a moustache at the beginning of your DVD then go out and buy another one. Both of the stinkers begin with the guy in the moustache. Any time you see Jackie Chan fighting this guy in the moustache (Kwang Yung-Moon) it is NOT Jackie Chan. The better version begins with Tien Feng and brother fighting Chen Hung-Lieh. The scene ends with Tien Feng escaping to raise his dead brother&apos;s child, who is the grown up Jackie Chan in the next scene. Though this is the better version it skips the scenes of the child growing up and tutored by Simon Yuen. Further problem is that in one version Simon Yuen is a borderline pedophile who puts the boy bare ass into a bag of snakes. The other version is far more &quot;family oriented.&quot; My idea of the best (my fourth version) would be to begin the movie with the child watching the kung fu school practice. This version unfortunately seques into the snakes in a bag scene. Instead replace that segment with the scene from the other version with Simon Yuen holding a chicken leg out for the child to grab. The master/student scenes in this edit are not creepy at all. There is also a rape scene that comes and goes and even comes again after it was cut (if that makes any sense... really it was like that). Also in one version with Simon Yuen there are some totally unnecessary scenes where he is teaching Jackie&apos;s body double. Most important of all in this genre is the final fight. Both versions with moustache guy end with a fight with Jackie&apos;s body double. The good version ends with an eight minute long fight on a dock. This is Chen Hung-Lieh (and occasionally his body double) versus the one and only totally real Jackie Chan. This is a darn good fight. Fans of Jackie or old school martial arts movies need to see this fight. So get the right version and just rest assured despite some things being dumb by the time the beer buzz hits you will be watching some real good action at the final 8-9 minutes.",

I took it home not expecting anything but a few laughs from Seth, and boy was I ever shocked!\n\n&quot;Can&apos;t Hardly Wait&quot; is not the greatest movie ever made, but I&apos;ll be totally honest with you, it&apos;s the biggest surprise of a movie I have ever watched.\n\nI now own this movie, and it&apos;s one of those movies that, when I&apos;m just not in the mood to go to a &quot;galaxy far, far away&quot;, (yes, sometimes it happens) I pop this in and giggle hysterically.\n\nSeth Green is wonderful playing the wannabe gangsta.  The members of Loveburger are a riot.  And Jennifer Love Hewitt isn&apos;t even all that annoying.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite amazing.  With a movie like this, you&apos;d assume that it&apos;d be just Smash Mouth, Blink 182 &amp; Third Eye Blind, and yes, those groups are included, but during the party scenes, there are a number of classic party tunes from Guns -n- Roses, Tone Loc and RUN DMC.  Not to mention the whole Barry Manilow &quot;Mandy&quot; references.\n\nNo, this movie will not be re-released for a 20th Anniversary, but it&apos;s definitely worth watching, and ranks far above all the other &quot;teen flicks&quot; that are swarming to your local theater as you read this."

Soon enough, they find out they get a lot more than acting lessons.\n\n&quot;Eating Out: Drama Camp&quot; is a pleasant surprise. I like the plot a lot, as it is full of bubblegum, lighthearted happiness. It is a film to sit back and relax, then enjoy, laugh and have a good time. Apart from the brain off entertainment, there are deeper subplots of self acceptance, courage and the heart to let go when love is gone. It can bring a tear to your eyes among all the laughter. That&apos;s the beauty of &quot;Eating Out: Drama Camp&quot;, and I really like it. I am already looking forward to the next &quot;Eating Out&quot;."

      "reviewBody": "My dad took me to see this one in the theater back in 1974 when I was 7 years old. It blew me away and helped fuel a lifelong love for adventure/fantasy. Hey, who doesn&apos;t like a cool adventure? The story is set in the early 1900&apos;s and concerns a rich Englishman who leads a rescue party deep into the Arctic in search of his missing explorer son. They track him to a mysterious lost colony of Vikings that has been cut off from the outside world for centuries. The plot is a fairly typical &quot;Lost World&quot; format: 1/3rd of the movie is spent searching for the lost world, 1/3rd is spent exploring the lost world, 1/3rd is spent being chased around/from the lost world. It&apos;s all fairly exciting, but not deep enough to impress an adult viewer. (However, with some deft tweaking this could be GREAT remake material for Disney.) I bought the DVD recently to take a trip down memory lane and I wasn&apos;t disappointed. It held up well to my memory. Yes, the effects are dated and some of them are downright terrible, but others are surprisingly good, and overall the film has a wonderful pre-CGI charm. You&apos;ll also get vibrant outdoor shots and some of the best matte work you&apos;ll find in ANY movie. It&apos;s not a bad choice for adventure/fantasy fans looking for family-friendly fare. Probably your only chance to see this film anymore is on DVD. Be sure to get the 30th anniversary edition as it has the extras.",

There aren&apos;t women in most of Buzzati&apos;s works and it is not by chance - why add them, to &quot;compensate&quot; what? There is no equivalent of a film score in his &quot;Barnabo&quot; - no embellishments/explanations, just raw nature (human and other). The original story is about a man who needs to learn to live with himself - and by the end he does. Still not sure what the film &quot;Barnabo&quot; is about, but it bored the hell out of me.",

German school children conduct interviews -- their innocent, questioning eyes unable to hide their horror upon hearing the details of how a German government systematically sought to murder all the Jews and how ordinary citizens cooperated and enabled such cruelty. This film does not try to capture the scope of six million Jews murdered. Instead, it focuses on one family and what the few survivors experienced and observed. Little vignettes are heart-wrenching: like when the adult Inge recalls how -- as a child -- she had to say farewell to her fellow Jewish schoolchildren, knowing that they were being transported on trains from Stuttgart to &quot;resettlement,&quot; but her family was allowed to stay because her father was a disabled war veteran. The film also contains horrifying documents: e.g., gestapo orders to appear at the train station, and newspaper articles extolling the removal of all Jews from a town. It makes you wonder how any German Jew could ever speak German again or visit Germany again or speak to any former friend. But they do. And I know how true this feeling is. My family lived in Karlsruhe only 75 miles from Goppingen, the city that is the subject of this film. My family was fortunate to escape Germany just before Kristallnacht. My aunt returned to Karlsruhe several times after the war and met with her childhood friend, a Christian. I accompanied her on one such trip. I met this wonderful friend and heard her describe the horror of being a Christian in Germany while the Nazis persecuted and deported the Jews. Her fear and her shame were obvious -- not unlike what was expressed by several of the Germans interviewed in this film. The telephone operator said that she will never forget the smell of the crematorium. And you get the impression that the German students listening to her will never forget their experience learning about it.",

      "reviewBody": "The first thing that I am willing to say is that I wish I were the director of this movie. Good direction can convert an average script into an admirable movie and poor direction can spoil even the greatest script. And that&apos;s what exactly happened to this flick produced by the liquor-cum-aviation baron, Vijay Mallya; whose plot has been lifted straightaway from a Hollywood movie - The Gift (2000).\n\nThere is an ancient Indian maxim - JISKA KAAM USI KO SAAJE, AUR KARRE TO PAAGAL BAAJE (one should do that job only which suits him or in which he is skilled; if he does someone else&apos; job, he will be considered mad because he will fail miserably at that). And that&apos;s what I am willing to convey to Mahesh Manjrekar, the director of hard-hitting, realistic and touching movies like - Vaastav, Tera Mera Saath Rahe, Nidaan, Ehsaas, City of Gold etc. Making a good suspense-thriller is not anybody&apos;s cup of tea. There was a time in Bollywood when brilliant suspense-thriller specialists like Raj Khosla, Raja Nawathe, Shankar Mukherjee, Biren Nag, Raghunath Jhalani and even B.R. Chopra were active in the field who gave us memorable suspense-thrillers like Humraaz, Mera Saaya, Woh Kaun Thi, Gumnaam, Mahal, Kohra, Anamika, Uljhan, Kanoon, Dhund etc. Now there are no such directors with the exception of Abbas-Mustan. Mahesh Manjrekar made an attempt to do their job, falling flat on his face. He could not just handle the brilliant script stolen from The Gift in his inexperienced hands (for this type of movie). Had Raj Khosla made this movie during the sixties or the seventies, it could have been a classic.\n\nIt&apos;s a murder-mystery with insertion of supernatural element through the God-given capability of the main protagonist (Bipasha Basu) to foresee future events. She is a single mother (widow) of an eight years old son, other than being a tarot card reader and an astrologer by her profession. The mystery is of the murder of Amrita Arora who first goes missing and then is found murdered with her dead body lying in a lake. There are many characters associated with the life of the central character of the movie, i.e., Bipasha, viz. Sanjay Dutt who is the principal of her son&apos;s school, Payal Rohatgi who is her friend, Neha Dhupia who is her another friend, Dino Morea who is a rowdy and Neha&apos;s wife-beater husband, Sunil Shetty who is a crazy motor-mechanic and considers Bipasha as his good friend, Shashikala who is her granny and whose spirit comes to bless her after death (Bipasha doesn&apos;t know by that time that her granny is no more), Himanshu Mallik who was Amrita&apos;s secret lover, Abhishek Bachchan who is her ex-beau etc. Finally the face of the murderer is revealed, bringing an end to the suspense after many scenes which involve the police activity and the court-room arguments of the lawyers involved too.\n\nThe treatment of this excellent plot is not at all coherent and impressive and the only face-saving grace is the outstanding performance of Bipasha alongwith some really good scenes (the best one, in my opinion, is the scene in which the spirit of Bipasha&apos;s granny, Shashikala gets evaporated into the air in front of her eyes). Due to poor direction, the movie which could have become an excellent one on overall basis, has been reduced to an assembly of some good and some bad scenes. It was promoted as a spine-chilling thriller but there is neither any chill for the viewer&apos;s spine, nor any good suspense (most of the viewers can guess the real murderer with relative ease), nor any momentum to keep the viewer continuously on the edge of his seat. The script of a good suspense-thriller should be well-knit and all the incidents being shown on the screen should have a logical association among them whereas the narrative of Rakht seems to be scattering here and there amidst the scenes which have not been sensibly linked and kept in proper sequence.\n\nAnand Raj Anand&apos;s music is passable. Two songs are good though. However these songs as well as the flash-back entry of Abhishek Bachchan only block the flow of the narrative. Had I directed this movie, either I would have made it sans any songs or would have made the music team prepare at least one good mystery song (in terms of words and composition) deepening the mist in the story.\n\nI am a die-hard fan of Bipasha Basu and hence my opinion towards her performance may be biased. Still the viewers will agree that she is the pivotal character of the story around whom the other ones move in a circle. And it&apos;s her only who keeps the viewer&apos;s interest alive in the movie. Though performers like Sunil Shetty, Dino Morea, Sanjay Dutt, Neha Dhupia etc. have tried their best to do justice to their assigned roles, the problem is that their characters have not been properly developed in the movie. They are sketchy and therefore, fail to leave a mark.\n\nCinematography and technical aspects of the movie are more or less OK. Background score is also OK though I have already mentioned that the movie fails to scare despite the tall claims of its makers. Besides, it&apos;s not a horror movie; it&apos;s a suspense movie.\n\nStill, I recommend this movie to the fans of Bipasha Basu as well as those who like mysteries very much because though it&apos;s not well made, the story is pretty good. The mystery-fans who have not watched the Hollywood movie - The Gift, may like it as a one time watch. \n\nMy overall rating for the movie is 2.5 stars. It could have become a movie worth the rating of 4 or 5 stars, had it been directed by Jitendra Mathur instead of Mahesh Manjrekar.",

      "reviewBody": "Ah, that Joe D&apos;Amato...you can&apos;t help but watch his films no matter how curiously interesting or just plain bad they are. If it weren&apos;t for the explicit versions, I think most folks would forget about them soon after viewing, unless just gawking at naked gals here and there in the guise of a &quot;legitimate film&quot; is your kind of thing. The BIG problem with Emanuelle In America is that it can&apos;t make up its mind if it wants to be mere exploitation or hardcore, as it bounces back and forth but never really completes those goals.\n\nLi&apos;l Miss Sexpot herself Laura Gemser is &quot;Miss Emanuelle&quot; who will travel anywhere and subject herself to any danger in order to get an ultimate story to further her journalistic endeavors (her sneaking around and snapping pics reminded me a lot of later Charlie&apos;s Angels adventures). She joins a harem of sorts and fondles women and watches bestiality, mingles with horny aristocrats, gets an expose of a women&apos;s pleasure resort (ah, finally a bunch of naked men in a movie), and shmoozes with bad men behind a snuff film ring. Yes, a film like this DOES need lots of sex to keep it going, but it&apos;s strange how much of it doesn&apos;t show up until much later.\n\nWhen sex scenes start, they end abruptly like a bad tease. During the sex, lots of jumpcuts jar the viewer so that it&apos;s not easy to get any pleasure out of viewing it. When hardcore footage appears, it usually never &quot;finishes&quot; (okay, there&apos;s a lack of money shots). When there ARE money shots, the scene has zipped by so fast you wonder if you were supposed to get excited or think that folks finish sexual encounters within one minute or less. Sex scenes in films like this are usually intended to arouse, and these leave you somewhat confused.\n\nHere is where I DEFEND something about this film: Those people who are only turned on by shaved, squeaky-looking pretty people in porn should not be so harsh to those of us who actually like a bit of body hair on men, or if women aren&apos;t so artistically trimmed. I have a feeling that most are bitching about the &quot;hairy men&quot; because of the bearded guy in the hut (in the Tarzan fantasy sequence). If anything, his hirsute appearance enhanced the energy of the too-brief scene, and I&apos;m sure there are plenty of folks that appreciated a natural-looking man instead of plastic pretty boys. As for the women, it&apos;s funny how so many &quot;reviewers&quot; are calling the actresses unattractive -- seems there are too many men out there that have ridiculously high standards for women. I didn&apos;t find these women unattractive; if anything they seemed real and still even out of the league that most of the drooling heterosexual viewers would ever get in real life. You know the kind, guys with beer guts who wear hats and t-shirts that say &quot;No Fat Chicks&quot; and think that all women are inherently bisexual. I say HOORAY for &apos;70s hairy porn, let&apos;s have more of it!\n\nFor me, instead of being creeped out by physically follicle-blessed men, I was creeped out by the sordid footage of the snuff films. Instead of a glimpse of one, we are subjected to several scenes of it, and it reminds me of those harsh slasher films that get women naked before they are dismembered. Are we supposed to be aroused by the nudity AND the physical violence at the same time? Otherwise, why so much of it in this film? I say fill out the other basic hardcore sex scenes more, and less of the poles and hooks being used as sexual torture. And to think David Cronenberg got his inspiration for &quot;Videodrome&quot; from this film.....eek!\n\nSo, take a look at Emanuelle In America so you can say you saw it, and if you got a kick out it, then it&apos;s actually okay. I saw it as a curiosity that had to be done and over with. It just really felt like a longgggg tease to me, so that I had to dig into my stash of hairy &apos;70s porn afterwards to feel satiated!",

      "reviewBody": "While it&apos;s no worse than much of the action movie junk that makes it to theatres, Bobby Z, originally entitled The Death and Life of Bobby Z, is a action thriller with Tim Kearney (Walker) as our hero. Kearney is a convict who&apos;s an ex-Marine and clearly not so much a bad person as one who has frequently found himself in trouble due to circumstance rather than intent. This gives director John Herzfeld, whose own career hacs been on less than an up-tick since the appropriately named 15 Minutes came and went in about that long, a premise for having a good guy hero who still fits the label of a tough convict.\n\nThe slightly convoluted storyline sees Kearney  whose life is in peril since he killed a biker gang boss in prison (self defence, of course)  offered an opportunity to walk free, as long as he&apos;s willing to impersonate a drug kingpin who happens to look just like Kearney, and who has just died. Fishburne plays the Drug Enforcement Agency cop who puts Kearney up to this task.\n\nBefore you can say &apos;gunfights are fun&apos;, Kearney is being shot at by the cops, manhandled by Mexican drug thugs, pursued by the bikers, and generally in demand by everyone, regardless of whether they think he&apos;s Kearney or Bobby Z. Our hero, of course, dodges the bullets, battles the bad guys, befriends Bobby Z&apos;s son (who has never met his dad) and romances a beautiful woman (Olivia Wilde) whose relationship with the bad guys is a bit hazy, but clearly quite intimate.\n\nFilled with head scratching twists and cornball dialogue, this is not exactly a brilliant film. Yet it&apos;s got a slick look and at least a few passably enjoyable action scenes. And Walker, while never likely to be mistaken for a Shakespearian thespian, has the good looks and charisma to lead the way here. At least his character isn&apos;t loaded down with as many stupidly threatening lines as Fishburne&apos;s. Wilde also does a passable job as Kearney&apos;s conflicted love interest; she&apos;s mainly called upon to look good (which she accomplishes rather easily), but also doesn&apos;t muff her lines when she does have something to say.\n\nMovie was funny, entertaining and I enjoyed it.",

      "reviewBody": "Greta Garbo, the mythical actress was last seen on the screen in this comedy. As directed by George Cukor, the film has its rewards for the fans of Ms. Garbo. The film, based on German playwright Ludwig Fulda, was adapted by some of the best screen writers of the time: S.N. Behrman, Saska Viertel and George Oppenheimer.\n\nMr. Cukor, an intelligent director probably miscalculated the effect this film would have on the viewers more used to a dramatic Garbo, who in here is made to lighten up. At times, Ms. Garbo seems to be on the right track to find a way to play the dual role of Karin/Katherine and appears to be having a good time playing the twins. Mr. Cukor was not able to erase some of the mannerisms for which the Swedish diva was famous for.\n\nThe basic problem with the film is the quick transformation of the ski instructor, Karin Borg, into the wife of the dashing and debonair Lawrence Blake. Perhaps if this aspect would have been exploited a bit more, the film would have taken a different tone. Not only are we surprised by the rapid change of the strong Karin into being relegated to being a second banana by marrying Larry.\n\nThe most interesting character from the film is Griselda Vaughn, Larry&apos;s former girlfriend who learns he has suddenly married a nobody, leaving her to fend for herself. Griselda is too smart to accept the situation. As played by Constance Bennett, she is one of the best things in the movie.\n\nMelvyn Douglas&apos; Larry is also excellent. He tries hard to convey this man who is used to be among sophistication and style. That&apos;s what makes it a bit hard to accept this man would settle with a woman that is attracted to a permanent winter state of mind. Ruth Gordon is good as the secretary that befriends Karin and conspires with her. Roland Young and Robert Sterling are seen in small roles.\n\nThe famous dance scene with Katherine, the twin sister, starts awkwardly, but Ms. Garbo proved she could hold her own against the partner that guides her around the night club&apos;s floor. Robert Alton has a tough time following Katherine.\n\n&quot;Two Faced Woman&quot; might not have been Greta Garbo&apos;s best, but it not a total disappointment either. This film should be seen because it was her last film.",

The movie is mainly focused on black lesbians in philly and follows one of them making a documentary on a famous black lesbian from the 30s. Going into this film I thought that I as a straight white guy wouldn&apos;t get much out of the film, but I was wrong. This film has a compelling story and powerful message anyone can learn from, just don&apos;t take your kids there is some slight nudity in the film, but other than that it&apos;s a must watch for everyone.",

It was one I managed to get cheaper tickets for so perhaps that&apos;s why I am not as critical as others. I found it entertaining and I was fully engrossed in the story. I felt some of the acting was a bit ropey but then again I thought Matthew Fox was superb. He really did portray a rather scary character, very different from that of Jack in Lost. There was some rather cheesy and altogether cheap parts to the movie, but overall it was a good watch. I can understand why some may have given this film a very low rating, but for me I saw a lot of positives.",
