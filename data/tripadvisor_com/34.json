We did a down town urban feel to match her future dreams of moving to the East Coast on the coast and live in the big city!! Coty worked her magic to bring out our shy girl and got some wonderful shots! Thank you Coty in Seattle and  Flytographer."

We don't get to see each other often, and I can't remember the last time we went away, just the two of us, nor when we last had professional photos taken. So I surprised my mom with the Flytographer session as a momento from our trip. We tend to be awkward people when it comes to photos - we'll inevitably stand in the exact wrong way so we end up looking like the  widest, weirdest versions of ourselves! But Kelly made us feel at ease and gave great guidance for positioning; and the photos turned out lovely and have a casual, easy-breezy feeling (a far cry from our usual stiff and forced demeanor in all other photos!). I can't say enough good things about Kelly, who was so kind and patient during our session, and I am so grateful for the beautiful photos she captured for me and my mom! I definitely plan to book other Flytographer sessions on future vacations around the globe!"

We will also learn about the history of the Market and view much of the incredible art on display. We'll also take the time to be serenaded by one of the many street performers. Walking through the fascinating labyrinth of the Pike Place is a special treat. Take in breath taking views of Elliot Bay and the surrounding mountains (weather permitting!) and enjoy special attention from your guide due to small group sizes. \nWander Northwest Walking Tours is permitted and licensed by the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA) to operate tours in the Pike Place Market Historical District. The PDA requires any business or person conducting paid tours within its properties and in the public areas of the historical district to be pre-approved and to have a license for this activity. ",

I did not know much about the market and our guide, James was super knowledgeable about the history and maybe even more importantly, all the best food sites. He actually gave us some samples along the way and pointed out all kinds of quirky elements of this amazing market. Saw the iconic Starbucks, left some gum on the wall, payed homage to a pair of musical performing cats, sampled some other-wordly smoked salmon... The pace was excellent and he tailored his remarks for our family really well (including kids). Definitely recommend."

Jake is a great storyteller and just as good of a driver. (Seriously, her ability to concentrate on everything the city streets had to throw at us AND continue to tell us about the locations we were viewing was practically supernatural.) Everyone in the group currently lives in Seattle, and she had stories and spooky facts that people didn't already know. So, locals, this tour is good for you and the out-of-towners. You get to see a lot of the city, including several spots that tourists don't usually get to see. Overall, the feedback from people in our group was quite enthusiastic and uniformly positive, which is definitely not always the case. I will be planning on taking her True Crime tour at some point, as I'm sure it's also quite good. Book this if you're considering it. You won't be disappointed."

He also did a nice job of explaining everything in English and Mandarin so everyone on the tour could follow and felt included. We made a stop beforehand at a local grocery store to grab lunch which we ate after the hike. It was a perfect day weather wise so we got amazingly clear views all day. The hike was good, some icy spots but fine with hiking boots and our guide had walking sticks for us to borrow as well. On the way back we stopped at an iron sculpture park which was also cool. All in all a great day and tour, especially if the weather is good."

We booked this tour thinking it would be a great way to cover a lot in one day—and overall, it was! Our tour guide was friendly and knowledgeable, and even went above and beyond by taking us to see the cherry blossoms at the University of Washington, which wasn’t originally on the itinerary. That unexpected stop made our day extra special.\n\nThe only downside—and the reason I’m leaving a mixed review—is what felt like a bait-and-switch when it came to an unexpected “service fee.” The night before our tour, I received a text from the guide letting me know there would be a $15 per person service fee, payable in cash. When I asked what it was for, there wasn’t a clear explanation, which made it feel more like a mandatory tip than an actual service fee.\n\nWe always plan to tip for good service when we travel, and we absolutely intended to show our appreciation to our guide. However, being told how much to tip and being asked for it in cash (in addition to any optional gratuity) felt unprofessional and misleading. It left a sour taste on what was otherwise a great experience.\n\nIf the company is going to charge an extra fee, it should be clearly communicated upfront at the time of booking—not sprung on guests at the last minute."

When I saw there was one in Seattle I booked it on their website right away. There are a lot of older style headstones in this beautiful old cemetery. Most of the Seattle pioneers are buried there along with Bruce Lee and his son Brandon. Our guide Joe was great. He was serious and hilarious during different times depending on what story he was telling."
