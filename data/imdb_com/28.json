I should follow him and want to be a director like him. \n\nGenerally, most of his film pertains silent periods. Maybe, he believe that the protagonist should talk less, work hard and put effect on the audiences. He makes his film in a simple way, but go through a complex thoughtful tunnel and in the end we see the light or the soul of his film. Basically, there is a part in this movie about &apos;death&apos; which really i was searching for. He described it in a easy way. A cinema he made as a director, actor,cinematographer, sound recorder like playing every role is just insurmountable. There are many who try to show himself as drama but in real he is not. But kim ki duk tried to make this drama and real came. When he cried in while watching his own cinema (spring,summer.....) It made me share some tears with him. I love this film a lot. Fabulous...!!!",

When he first meets wheelchair-bound Glover, he has the upper hand. His physicality and his threats of violence can only take him so far though. As their relationship continues, Glover more and more becomes the one in control. \n\nMany folks reviewing this movie seem to hate it and yet I found the dynamic between the two individuals and their ambiguous sexual orientation was interesting enough to carry the plot along to its eventual conclusion.\n\n That dynamic and the eye candy provided by Antonie Kamerling was certainly enough to keep me interested until the end.",

Gert Frobe as the Dutch sea captain was memorable, and the English cast, director Alexander Mackendrick and the screenwriter(s) should be commended for creating a superb example of the art of cinema.  I have but one sad comment: Why isn&apos;t this film available on videotape or disk, or at least on cable?"

      "reviewBody": "Cimino shows that he is a crass and hysteric filmmaker here. His sensibilities place him somewhere between Cecil B. DeMille and Francis Coppola. He&apos;s got to film big, so even a cop flick about violence in Chinatown has to be a saga. There&apos;s no weight to it, it just has to be a sprawling story that&apos;s only vaguely about social issues of importance. He&apos;s got to have both the scope and relevance, preferably something to brood over. He&apos;s got to have lots of people and lots of scenery in the frame. There&apos;s a pretty ludicrous scene set in backwoods Thailand that only seems to exist so that a Triad boss can majestically gallop in view of a swarm of soldiers (and later brandish a severed head).\n\nThere&apos;s nothing worse than a filmmaker who can only leverage ambition and control in his art (Coppola once in a while had good intuitions). So at its most profound, cinematic beauty is at perfume ad level here, say a woman in silhouette sliding into a majestic night-view of New York. What&apos;s the term, &apos;elephant art&apos;? I say it doesn&apos;t breathe.\n\nWorst of all, since he is very much a storyteller, these days a novelist living in Paris, his dramatic sense is a lot of puff and noise on a typewriter. It has no life. It&apos;s screen writing 101 like in one of those books that tell you about the &apos;hero&apos;s journey&apos; and where to put the &apos;inciting incident&apos;: the couple is growing bitter and distant, and it&apos;s right on the first scene that they have to curse, yell, and throw things as they explain all that&apos;s wrong between them: he&apos;s never at home, he doesn&apos;t care, she wants a baby.\n\nAnd he&apos;s got the ideal writing partner for this. Oliver Stone: so angry barbs at the media, school-lessons in American and Chinese history, and Vietnam is behind all of it. It&apos;s all abrasive on this end, as is Stone.\n\nMickey Roorke, usually game for roles that call for lots of smirking and boyish thrashing-about, is the violent, crazy, anguished new sheriff in &apos;Town. He browbeats and ridicules the Chinese journalist girl and of course she goes to bed with him the moment he has finished doing so, because what&apos;s more charming than a &apos;flawed protagonist&apos;.\n\nThe film is bookended by public funeral processions and that could have been something, connoting obsession, artificial images, false narratives. Watch John Lone in M. Butterfly for that. Watch Fukasaku for chaotic action."

Very good mix between studio-scenes and scenes filmed in Lisbon. Also the presentation of the old fado legends as Amalia is wonderful. Even the dancing scenes are great, though the dance is not belonging to fado. The appearance of Mariza, Camane and Carlos do Carmo are magnificent. They are the great fado-singers of the past, present and even for the future.I was surprised by the breathtaking scenes with Mariza and Patrick de Bana, I couldn&apos;t imagine that fado can be danced too. But Saura tooked his many years experience to make film, which shows not only the traditional fado music, but also the new ways and the relations to African and Brazilian music.",

      "reviewBody": "In the year 1993, Brandon Lee created a very memorable, dark &amp; beautiful character: The Crow. The movie, with an exceptional script, smart direction, excellent photography and a brilliant cast, it truly one of my all time favorites. Everything from the look of the film, the characters (especially Lee as the Crow), the phenomenal soundtrack and the overall story of love being stronger than death - I was hooked! I love that film! I saw it in theaters no less than 8 times.\n\nCITY OF ANGELS was a shallow, bastardized attempt to cash in on the success of the first film. In some ways, ANGELS almost ripped-off the original, but in a way that makes me loathe the film. Very disappointing! \n\nSALVATION, the third in the series was...I can&apos;t even remember. I saw it once, and do not remember being overwhelmed by it or feeling anything for it.\n\nAnd now, 2005 brings back the return of The Crow with WICKED PRAYER. Unlike the first three films, this one takes place in the desert, near an Indian reservation. I must admit, I was impressed with the cinematography on this film. The desert scenes, the flashback scenes, all were well done and looked great.\n\nSo...what do I think of the film? The direction? The acting? For starters the direction of this film was all too often sloppy. It appeared, more times than not, the film was confused with where it wanted to go. The characters seemed stuck into scenes, with little to no direction, and carried scenes with no skill. Each set up seemed and felt under-rehearsed and underdeveloped.\n\nEdward Furlong is by NO stretch of my imagination an acceptable Crow! Looking too much like a gay goth groupie, instead of a vengeful angel set to make the wrong things right. His costume appeared to steal too much from the original. I felt his performance was bland and tasteless. There was no emotion displayed by his character. I did not feel pity or sorry for him, or what happens to him. I was no convinced that his love was so undying that he could be brought back from the dead. He is no Brandon Lee! I mean, come on: &quot;Quoth the Raven, Nevermore. Motherf**ker!&quot; What kind of crap writing is that? Boreanez is wasted in this film. Though, he has not impressed me much with previous roles such as Adam Carr in VALENTINE, I still feel he is a solid actor and really can pull off the bad guy look. However, in WICKED PRAYER, it never feels like we are 100% sure of what he is doing or why. OK, I get that he is performing a ritual to become a demon or devil, but where did this come from? What is in motivation? World domination? I don&apos;t think we will ever know.\n\nTara Reid....Ugh! And Macy Gray?!?!? And what was up with Dennis Hopper, in what could only be his worst performance.\n\nNone of the cast is able to save this mess! Very upsetting to see the series continue to be treated this way. What started out 12 years ago with such an inspiring beginning, is continuing to fall further down the spiral of sequel Hell!",

      "reviewBody": "Trying to kill a couple of hours before bed, I decided to give this film a go even though I had not heard an awful lot about it. Having recently seen and enjoyed a couple of Canet&apos;s other films, I knew I would at least be entertained. In the next two and a half hours that followed, I can honestly say I was mesmerised by what I saw. As the film finished and the credits rolled in I was overcome with a strange feeling of sadness that the film had finished, but also a huge sense of gratitude that I had probably just seen one of the best films of my life. Coming from an actor and also a Film degree major, that is something I don&apos;t take lightly to admitting. Perhaps in time the novelty will wear off and the more times I see it, the more holes I will be able to pick in it. However, I know the film did something right as I felt compelled to sign up on here and write this review at 1am! Now I&apos;m not going to bark on too much about all the reasons why this film is so great, because that is something you all have to make up your own minds with. The best compliment I can pay &apos;Little White Lies&apos; is that it was such a genuine film in terms of content right down to the acting. Marion Cottilard in particular is absolutely fantastic, there aren&apos;t many people who can perform to that level, her performance was flawless at times. Anyhow, I&apos;ve said my bit. This film deserves to be seen by everyone, I have, I hope you all do too.",

They are not really annoying as in most recent ones. It is a good epic with likable characters, a bit on the stereotype range though -that German did have a penchant for explosives- but still they managed to integrate a believable rat pack for the mission with their cultural differences hinted who do not have everything laid for them. Favorite phrase &quot;you &quot;think&quot;is that sort of device?&quot; &quot;Well the prophesy book is not really an instruction manual&quot; whose names I actually managed to remember by the end of the movie. While is not a masterpiece it does deserve a sequel which anyone who liked Riddick and that sort of action movies will enjoy."

      "reviewBody": "Based on a Japanese novel by Koushun Takami, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is the story of a group of ninth graders who are transported to a small isolated island with a map, food and different arms. They are told to fight each other for three consecutive days until there remains but one student, who will then be named the &apos;winner&apos;. All students are forced to wear a metal collar with a radar so that their teacher is aware when a rule is being broken.\n\nThe film is set in Japan and is in Japanese (and if you do come across a dubbed version, dispose of it immediately because it&apos;s only worth it to watch the original). It&apos;s hard to classify this film, as despite the extreme violence in it, it isn&apos;t action and despite its nightmarish feel, it isn&apos;t horror. It&apos;s just in between. There are many themes to this story; from to trust to complete selfishness (killing your best friend to save your own life) to suicide to disloyalty, and the list goes on.\n\nThe actors in Battle Royale were amazing. It is rare to find young talents like these, for instance, in Hollywood. These actors were by far the best young actors I have seen in all my life (though most of them weren&apos;t as young as their characters were). Tatsuya Fujiwara plays the main character, Shuya, a young man who is struck by tragedy when he becomes an orphan. All he has now is his best friend and the girl with whom he is madly in love. Fujiwara did a great job of transmitting the feel of despair that one would probably feel if he/she were to see his best friend die before their eyes, or to have to see classmates killing each other and then to portray that never-ending trust that two lovers share. The other actors all did a generally good job as well.\n\nThe first actor I&apos;d like to criticize is Taro Yamamoto, who played the compassionate Shougo Kawada, who helps the protagonist and his girlfriend as the game of Battle Royale goes on. I thought that Yamamoto overplayed the character&apos;s casualty and I didn&apos;t feel as attached to him watching the movie as I did reading the comic book. The other actor I thought did a terrible job relative to the other actors was Masanobu Ando, who played the haunting character Kazuo Kiriyama, who basically seemed immune to everything. While reading the book, that guy really creeped the sh*t out of me. But in the movie, he just basically did the &quot;undercover&quot; thing and sort of leaped from place to place and tortured and killed people and that was it. You didn&apos;t feel anything, and in my opinion, that character was one of the most important so it was pretty disappointing. But putting those two aside, the acting WAS splendid, just as the directing of (sci-fi/Japanese gangster movie director) Kinji Fukasaku was.\n\nI thought that the story was very haunting and compelling, and that you should read the novel or the comic book before watching the movie because just the use of your imagination and attachment to the characters while reading the books is so much more real. I really enjoyed the movie too, though, and would recommend it to anyone who has the stomach for constant shootings, hangings, blowing-up, abandoned corpses and a lot of blood squirting everywhere.\n\nAnd so if it fits the shoe, rent it out. You probably won&apos;t regret it.",

      "reviewBody": "By the time &quot;Tarzan and the Huntress&quot; was produced by Sol Lesser with Kurt Neumann, one of my favorite Hollywood talents, the jungle man series was fifteen years old. By saddling the jungle man from the outset with Jane, the MGM executives committed the same error Edgar Rice Burroughs had made in his original creation. There being few excuses to take Tarzan far enough from home to find movie-length adventures, it became necessary to bring those making his actions necessary to him. These included Nazis, strange tribes, but most often unscrupulous hunters of one variety or another. In this unusually-well-directed and attractive entry to the series, the chief of invaders is a far-from-evil but uncaring female, played by gorgeous Patricia Morison. It is this aspect of the film that was copied so often later on; until then, virtually every illicit jungle hunter hand been male, and the only females in the jungle had been lost white goddesses. Fashionable Tanya Rollins is therefore a very important figure in film history. Her hired guide, Barton MacLane, is the real villain of this piece. As a champion of the wild heritage against a flawed pseudo-Christian civilization, Tarzan refuses to let anyone trap animals on his side of the river (never identified). On the other side of the river, the expedition&apos;s leaders have struck a bargain with a prince, son of the king (Charles Trowbridge). The bargain is broken, when MacLane has the prince killed, in order to deal with his more amenable brother. Instead of taking two of every animal, the expedition can then take unlimited animals to captivity for remunerative sale. When Tarzan learns that Cheetah has been captured and smells out what is going on, he decides to intervene, at great risk because the bad guys have rifles. This is champion swimmer Johnny Weissmuller&apos;s eleventh turn as the King of the Jungle; he is still stolid and sometimes impressive, especially when he has Brenda Joyce as a blonde Jane or raven-haired Morison to play off. And Johnny Sheffield as Tarzan&apos;s adopted son, Boy, has become by then an attractive and grown-up young man, on the verge of his own series as the sourceless but likable &quot;Bomba&quot; the Jungle Boy. Others appearing in the cast include John Warburton as Carl Morley, Wallace Scott as Smithers, and Mickey Simpson as Monak. And Cheetah the chimpanzee is given a very large role in the film, almost as an agent of Nature allegorically playing the nemesis to Ms. Rollins&apos; nefarious hopes. The fact that Morison never wanted her men to kill Tarzan, or anyone else, excuses her complicity in what they do to gain unearned wealth; there are exciting scenes as Tarzan bedevils, is nearly killed by and then finally overcomes the true villains. But the highlight of the film, as anyone not suffering myopic of the value-system, should be able to know is the loveliness and performance by Patricia Morison. She has several scenes in a ten;t and when she undresses as a silhouetted figure lighted by a lamp within, or when she argues with Tarzan, or when she visits his home and is bedeviled by Cheetah who steals her lipstick and other implements, she steals the film completely. Like brilliant and vivacious Greer Garson before her, she seems to be beloved by U.S. moviegoers only if they are educated to ignore her British accent; compared for instance to brassy and passable actress Susan Hayward who came along at the same time, she is a gem, classically trained and brilliant either at acting or underplaying, as here. This is a often-imitated film, a milestone of adventure-level fun and adroit characterization; it is very popular with fans, thanks to brilliant director Kurt Neumann, who also co-produced. The authors get lots of fun out of an only-passable story line in every scene; Bbt to this film we owe &quot;Tarzan the Magnificent&quot;, &quot;Tarzan and the Lost Safari&quot;, &quot;Jivaro&quot; and a number of other films that finally saw a female in a jungle as something other than a danger or a distraction. The music by talented Paul Sawtell and the luminous cinematography by Archie Stout are rich assets here, by my lights. Art direction by McClure Capps and the costumes, especially Ms. Morison&apos;s by Harold Clandenning, add to the film&apos;s values. The script by Jerry Gruskin and Rowland Leigh is serviceable and some of the dialogue I find to be above-average. Wallace Scott and Ted Hecht were also featured; look for a well-done elephant stampede and Ms. Morison; they are for me the highlights of a seminal and enjoyable exotic-locale adventure.",

Rex Allen makes for a satisfactory narrator, at least. The music is decent, too.\n\nAs noted, there are adorable shots of animals but there simply isn&apos;t enough to make it a film worth watching in my eyes.",

      "name": "Very much a worthy sequel, every bit as good as &apos;The Bourne Identity&apos;",
      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Bourne Identity&apos; was a very pleasant surprise, giving a fairly well-worn genre a much needed freshness. It had its imperfections, but was a very solid and even very good film with much to recommend and introduced a cast-against-type Matt Damon in one of his best roles.\n\nIt is up for debate as to whether &apos;The Bourne Identity&apos;s&apos; first sequel &apos;The Bourne Supremacy&apos; is better or weaker. To me, both films are about equal with a couple of improvements at the same time being achieved in &apos;The Bourne Supremacy&apos;. &apos;The Bourne Supremacy&apos; may lack the freshness that most of &apos;The Bourne Identity&apos; had, in terms of basic structure it&apos;s a little samey if not exactly routine. The editing, using the shaky camera technique that tends to not sit well with me, does have instances where it does get a bit dizzying and too much. Really didn&apos;t like how underused Franka Potente, who brought such a great gutsiness in &apos;The Bourne Identity&apos; and her and Damon&apos;s chemistry doesn&apos;t have the chance to register.\n\nAs aforementioned, along the way there are improvements. The supporting cast have more rounded and better developed characters, with the actors having more to do. The final act in &apos;The Bourne Supremacy&apos; is more cohesive, more consistent and less clichÃ©-ridden than &apos;The Bourne Identity&apos; got towards its end. There is also even more substance and emotion thanks to more emphasis on that and the plotting characterisation than the more action-packed (but still intelligent and exciting) &apos;The Bourne Identity&apos;.\n\nVisually, like &apos;The Bourne Identity&apos;, &apos;The Bourne Supremacy&apos; looks slick and stylish with even more breath-taking locations. The editing and camera-work are not perfect, but mostly the technique did intensify the intensity and atmosphere and didn&apos;t make anything incomprehensible, some of it is used more artfully than most times shaky cam is used (too often abused to excessive lengths). When it was a problem it wasn&apos;t constant and more than not there wasn&apos;t a problem. And this, and in no way is this intended to sound superior or conceited, is coming from an epileptic.\n\nMusic score is even more dynamic, atmosphere enhancing and more layered this time round, while Paul Greengrass&apos; drama-documentary style and background to his directing is used to full advantage. The script has more prominence here, and is sharp and intelligent without being too talky in a more script and plot heavy instalment. The story is exciting and thrilling with relentless pacing, poignant and dark emotion and with nothing too hard to follow.\n\nDespite less of an emphasis the action is very diverting and choreographed and performed beautifully. The final action sequence and the subway scene have a real adrenaline-rush quality, and in no way does the action strain credibility or get too bombastic while still delivering splendidly on the fun and thrills to edge-of-your-seat effect.\n\nAll the characters engage and are interesting, with Bourne well-established in development and the supporting cast have more to do and in general are better utilised. Matt Damon continues to impress in a departure role that proves to be one of his best. In support, Joan Allen steals every scene she&apos;s in and Brian Cox is given room for more menace and dimension this time. Karl Urban is chillingly cold-blooded. Only the underusing of Potente disappoints in this particular element.\n\nAll in all, a worthy sequel that is just as good (on the same level pretty much) as its very good predecessor. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Since 2003, the people of Darfur - mainly tribal blacks - have been undergoing a systematic genocide at the hands of the largely Arab-run government of Sudan (Darfur being a western region of that nation). The UN has estimated that, as of 2007, 200,000 residents of Darfur have been slaughtered and 2.5 million more displaced from their homes and forced to flee to refugee camps both inside Darfur and in neighboring countries.\n\nThe must-see documentary &quot;Darfur Now&quot; focuses on six specific individuals who have chosen to make a difference in the world. Adam Sterling, co-founder of Sudan Divestment Task Force, is a young activist from Los Angeles who spends his time not only trying to raise public awareness of the atrocities taking place in that part of the world but also lobbying the California legislature and governor to get oil companies to stop funding the Sudanese government. Luis Moreno-Ocampo is a prosecutor for the International Criminal Court whose job it is to build a case against the Sudanese government officials in order to bring them to justice in The Hague. Ahmed Mohammad Abakar is the Chief Sheikh of the Hamadea Displaced Persons Camp. Don Cheadle (&quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;) is, of course, a well-known movie star and author who has met with a number of world leaders on the issue. Pablo Recalde is a humanitarian who delivers food to people in the refugee camps, often at great personal risk to himself and those who work with him. And, finally, Hejewa Adam is a rebel for the Sudan Liberation Movement, a group dedicated to fighting back against the killers.\n\nAll six share a common belief that what happens to one person on this planet happens to us all - and it is this philosophy that motivates them to take an active role in doing everything they can to try and change that world.\n\nSurvivors of the raids recount in horrific detail the inconceivable suffering they have endured at the hands of the Janjaweed, an Arab militia unit funded by the government to carry out rapes, pillaging and murder on a massive scale (though the government, of course, denies it). We also spend time with the rebel forces - motley bands of dedicated but poorly armed and trained men and women who have taken to the hills to defend their lives and homeland, while they wait patiently and, in many cases, in vain for the &quot;white people&quot; to come and help them.\n\nWriter/director Theodore Braun effectively cuts back and forth between his various subjects and, in so doing, brings an emotionally compelling dramatic arc to the film.\n\nMore than anything else, &quot;Darfur Now&quot; drives home how monumentally difficult and frustrating it can be to get recalcitrant people to put aside their daily concerns or foot-dragging governments their political expediency in order to help put an end to any humanitarian crisis, not just the one in Darfur. But, at the same time, the film points out that people of goodwill, particularly if they are large enough in number, can have an enormous impact if they are simply willing to step up to the challenge.\n\nFilled with both hope and heartbreak, &quot;Darfur Now&quot; is a fit companion piece to &quot;The Devil Came on Horseback,&quot; an equally compelling documentary on the same topic. Together, these two fine films help to bring Darfur&apos;s plight to the world-at-large.\n\nThe theme of both films is, perhaps, best summed up by the actor George Clooney who, in a press conference on the issue, asks, &quot;One day this will end, and the question will be, where did the nations of these United Nations stand?&quot; Where indeed!",

      "reviewBody": "Young Shaun (Aidan Cullen) with Riley his dog, lies and steals his deceased grandfather Gus&apos; (John Voight) Urn- from his mother to spread ashes on a remote mountain. We see Gus almost every step of the way and only Shaun can see and hear him. \n\nThis seems to be a made-for-tv movie. It&apos;s okay, but I didn&apos;t have any feeling for Shaun or for Riley either and that should have happened. John Voight was okay as the deceased Gus with his words of wisdom and encouragement to Shaun from time to time. The trip to the mountain and what Shaun encounters during the journey was kind of tame to be honest, and oh, yes, two men in the woods and we are not sure what that was all about. No, no Deliverance but those scenes did come to mind. Hey, this is a family movie, but who or what were these two men is a mystery that was never explained. \n\nLater the almost-divorced parents learn they had been duped by Shaun and go looking for him on that remote mountain. No real suspense or tension within this movie. Like I said: a made for tv movie, a walk in the park. Tame. \n\nNotables: Jamie Kennedy as Kristopher, Shaun&apos;s father; Vail Bloom as Rachel, Shaun&apos;s mother; Derick Van Orden as Jebediah one of the men in the woods; and Matthew Davis as Eartle as one of the men in the woods. \n\nThe cinematography should have been better than it was. There were too many shots too up close to the fauna and not enough long shots of the scenery except for maybe one shot. There was a nice pastel sunset though. \n\nA note of caution: Most everyone knows, by now, to never spread cremation ashes and to secure the URN in a safe place.\n\nAt the end, would it surprise you to know that Rachel says she thinks she did see Gus too? Hmmmm................ (5/10)\n\nViolence:: Yes, but not much.  Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: Much between Gus and Shaun. Language: Brief small stuff. Rating: C",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s 2028 L.A. Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown) leads a robbery gang during a city-wide revolt against privatized water. His brother is shot during the escape and he seeks refuge at Hotel Artemis. It is a secured private hospital for criminal members run by a hard-nosed nurse (Jodie Foster). Everest (Dave Bautista) is her giant muscle. She risks everything by saving policewoman Morgan (Jenny Slate). Other patients include loud-mouth arrogant Acapulco (Charlie Day) and assassin Nice (Sofia Boutella) on a secret mission. Waikiki discovers that his brother had stolen jewels from crime boss Wolf King (Jeff Goldblum) who shows up looking for treatment.\n\nI really like the concept but there are issues with the execution. It&apos;s a movie of outrageous potential. With a few questionable logistics, my biggest problem is that I don&apos;t feel connected with Sterling K. Brown&apos;s character. Jodie Foster is doing her hardest. Despite some fun ideas, it doesn&apos;t really rise to its possibilities. It&apos;s not crazy enough. It&apos;s not compelling enough. It is good enough to be watchable.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1893, India was a colony of England. The starving native farmers had to pay an imposed tax to the British soldiers for the protection of their lands, delivering most of their harvest to the British Queen. In those years, the lands were very dry due to the lack of rain, and the inhabitants of Champaner decide to request to their Rajah Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to waive the taxes. While waiting for the Rajah, Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the beloved friend of Gauri (Gracy Singh), comments that the silly game of cricket was a stupid game, comparable to the Indian child game &apos;gilli-danda&apos;. The nasty and arrogant Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), who had had a previous discussion with Bhuvan, listens to his comment and challenges Bhuvan to play a match against the British team, imposing the following condition: if the natives win the game, they would not need to pay Lagaan for the next three years. Otherwise, they would triplicate their payment in that year. Bhuvan accepts the bet despite of the opinion of his people. The sister of Captain Russell, Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley), finds the competition unfair to the Indians and decides to help Bhuvan and his friends, teaching them how to play cricket. \n\nThis movie is a magnificent and overwhelming fairytale. It really deserved an Oscar nomination! The nice and well-directed story has wonderful songs and interpretations, romance, treason, dispute, drama, beautiful messages, outstanding choreography, being a stunning film indicated as family entertainment. The expensive Brazilian DVD is a shame, showing a total lack of respect of the &apos;Columbia Tristar Home Video&apos; with the Brazilian costumers: the important songs do not have subtitles in Portuguese. I changed the option in the &apos;Menu&apos; to &apos;English&apos;, and there were subtitles in English. At least in the opinion of the ridiculous Columbia representatives, Brazilians shall learn English first to understand the wonderful lyrics sang in Hindi. I feel really sorry for those who cannot understand English, since they will miss the meaning of these songs. It is amazing how 225 minutes running time passes so fast when you see such a marvelous movie. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &apos;Lagaan â A Coragem de Um Povo&apos; (&apos;Lagaan â The Courage of a People&apos;)",

I could look the date up on my slides, I guess. We spent the evening with them partying in their awesome, customized Mercedes bus overlooking the lake. It was really fun and interesting. We had NO idea who they were. Dieter was very cool, but couldn&apos;t speak English very well. Uschi translated for him but she had a heavy, very sexy, German-glish accent. They told us all about their travels, how they got their bus, about their wedding in India riding elephants, and about the magazine articles Dieter wroteÂone was about &quot;The Return of Uschi&quot; so we figured she was obviously famous somehow, but we couldn&apos;t really understand the story with the language barrier and all. Not sure they even tried to explain. They were very friendly and down-to-earth. She was absolutely, amazingly, stunningly beautiful. Her hair was short then. She kissed me on the cheek when we said our goodbyes the next morning. Then we went our separate ways. We wrote back and forth a time or two. She said they were on their way to Baja Mexico where they went in the winters. I tried to look them up on the web without success, because I mistakenly tried looking for Uschi &quot;Bockhorn.&quot; When I finally discovered her correct name and story I was stunned. And when I found out that Dieter had died, not too very long after we met them I was doubly-stunned and saddened. My middle son is named Dieter. Maybe I&apos;ll write her again sometime, maybe not, but I&apos;ll always remember that night. In the meantime I&apos;m not sure if I want to get to know the Uschi of this movie or the Uschi I remember. We&apos;ll have to see."

Here, it&apos;s the same thing but during the decade before, thus in the 70s : what&apos;s striking is the high politic and societal consciousness of those students (marxism, feminism) and their fashion style (wool) that dresses them like shepherds ! In the 80s, those 2 facts have disappeared but we had still style and education (I studied then), whereas nowadays, in the next millennium, those same classes are just hollow, stupid and dress in sport-ware all the time !\n\nAs a Klapish movie, we can discern already his future trademark : it&apos;s fresh, funny and he isn&apos;t afraid to play with the frame (here, when they are all stoned !). He knew already how to blend some serious matters (jobless, getting old and responsible, falling in love) in a light content. His casting was great as he was one who discovered Romain. All his buddies are cool too and i admit that the young English teacher is just amazing to shake a young shy student (like I was).",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Joyless&apos; is right; this brooding, silent melodrama, set in the economic shambles of post-World War I Austria, looks as if it were filmed entirely at night. Working on the same principle as a soap opera, it&apos;s an exaggerated dramatic recreation of life in hard times, when housewives were forced to sell themselves to pay for their family&apos;s next meal, while the last remnants of the aristocracy blithely danced the evenings away and worked their spurious financial schemes, ignorant of the poverty surrounding them. The complicated plot involves jealousy, murder, seduction, and Greta Garbo, looking older and wiser than any twenty year old has a right to. The film was almost a warm-up for Pabst&apos;s equally debauched &apos;Pandora&apos;s Box&apos;, and was also known (for good reason) as &apos;Street of Sorrow&apos;.\n\nNote: I saw what was probably the truncated version, on Super-8 (!!) The fully restored film would likely rate even higher...",

This movie takes place in flashback format and the quality of the production is proven in the fact the the movie is seamless and smooth that even watching it without subtitles (which I did!), the story was still so easy to follow. Classic is not strictly just a love story, but a story about humanity and relationships of all kinds: friendship and the bond between children and parents. I am reminded of &quot;Amelie&quot; for it&apos;s lightness of spirit and dips into the imaginative and the fanciful. An underlying belief in romance rules the characters in both films. Classic is a complete package, there are no loose ends and instead at the end, you can take a deep breath and feel satisfied. I think that this would be a great foriegn film for someone who doesn&apos;t like foreign films to see because the actors portray the characters and their stories so convincingly that you can read the humanity without understanding the language. The quality of the acting and entire composition of the movie make it universal. It&apos;s inspiring to know that even in 2003 a film can be created that is truly timeless.",

And will push sex and drugs so that some youths will think thisï»¿ is all what life is about. I don&apos;t know if I am shallow but I found every girl in this movie to be ugly more ugly than some porn stars they were all just repulsive too and speaking of porn stars the quality of this movie is like watching porn except it revolves around 2 annoying and unfunny characters and they just act like a couple of basers and there acting is horrible. Not to mention the story either cause it&apos;s just some random crap thrown into lengthen the run time of the movie which would have been fine if it was funny, but they just throw crude humor and sometimes crude humor is okay but it&apos;s not funny and just expect the audience to laugh by the shock value, and the shock isn&apos;t even that original. At one point theyï»¿ both were screwing pieces of fruits and bagel... Why the hell would I want to see that? They try to make the movie into some crude humor with sex and drugs, but the movie was just crude. I can see some people liking this film, but there IQ will drop drastically while watching this. It was not a good road trip type of movie, but it wasn&apos;t unbearable to the point I didn&apos;t finish the film and dislike it to the point of giving it a 1 but maybe that is cause I saw it with some friends while having a conversation.\n\n2.8/10",

Don&apos;t expect sense, great acting or original dialogue, just go for the kicks and enjoy. A totally deranged, over-the-top splatfest with hideous viral deaths galore, some of the best post-holocaust punk makeup and chase scenes since Road Warrior, brilliant use of 1980&apos;s dance music (Adam and the Ants, Frankie Goes to Hollywood--the placement of Siouxie and the Banshees&apos; &quot;Spellbound&quot; and a Fine Young Cannibals track at the punk barbecue is simply inspired), a coliseum battle-to-the-death, a bizarre interlude in a Scottish fiefdom that feels as if the movie took a fast detour into the Shire, and the coolest star turn by a UK car since Harry Potter&apos;s posse made one fly. All of it snapping and crackling with so much kinetic energy and wild creative freedom that it&apos;s hugely exhilarating. We were still giggling like maniacs an hour after the movie.=) It&apos;s just such fun to see a director decide to go full-speed over the edge like this. It&apos;s not great art, but trust me, if you enjoyed Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Planet Terror, Escape from New York/L.A., and/or any recent zombie movie, you can&apos;t miss this one.",

      "name": "Another nice Raj Kapoor movie",
      "reviewBody": "This is another nice Raj Kapoor movie, directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee.\n\nThe story is about Rajkumar (Raj Kapoor), an unemployed honest painter who lives in a rented room to Mrs. D&apos;Sa (Lalita Pawaar). He never pays his rent, and though Mrs. D&apos;Sa gets annoyed, she treats him like her son.\n\nOn his way to finding a job, Raj bumps into Aarthi (Nutan), who was climbing over a wall to get out of her boring college class. Then he goes to his job interview, which is at a restaurant. He checks the daal (lentils) he finds a roach floating at the top. He reports this by screaming it out to everyone at the restaurant...which makes the manager very annoyed. Raj&apos;s honesty wasn&apos;t getting him anywhere, he gets kicked out.\n\nHe goes home only to make Mrs. D&apos;Sa mad. The next day, he bumps in to Aarthi again (in a chain reaction biking crash lol). Aarthi tells him that her name is Aasha. But Aasha (Shuba Khote) is actually Aarthi&apos;s naukrani...even though they&apos;re like sisters. Aarthi continues to pretend that she herself is the naukrani. She invites Raj to paint a picture at her &quot;malkin&apos;s&quot; house the next day. Raj readily agrees.\n\nThe next day, Aarthi keeps on making up stories about her poorness, saying that her mom was really sick, and that&apos;s why she&apos;s working at the mansion. He gets paid 1,000 rupees for his work, but because of his kind heart, he gives it all back to Aarthi...saying that it would come in handy for her sick mother.\n\nWhich makes Aarthi like him all the more.\n\nHe goes back home, again with no pay to give Mrs. D&apos;Sa. After a long argument, she gives him a quarter to go eat. When he&apos;s outside, Raj is almost hit by the car of Seth Ramnath (Motilal). Raj continues to look for his attani in the dark. To test his honesty, Seth Ramnath drops his wallet in the middle of the road. When Raj notices, he picks it up and wants to give the wallet back to Seth Ramnath...he gets chased by gonads...and goes through a lot ~ but he returns the wallet. Impressed, Seth Ramnath gives him a job in his office.\n\nRaj&apos;s life starts going well. He does hard work. Mrs. D&apos;Sa doesn&apos;t take his rent, because they basically become like mother and son. And of course he has his dear &quot;Aasha&quot;.\n\nBut what Raj doesn&apos;t know is that Seth Ramnath is the uncle of his &quot;Aasha&quot;, and what Seth Ramnath doesn&apos;t know is that Aarthi likes Raj. Poor Raj doesn&apos;t even know that his &quot;Aasha&quot; is actually Aarthi. He has yet to find out about what&apos;s in store for him.\n\nAnd once he does (in a quite saddening way)...his life is upside down. To make matters worse, Mrs. D&apos;Sa gets the flu.\n\nAnother thing that Raj doesn&apos;t know: the company he works at sells contaminated medicines sometimes.\n\nHow is Rajkumar&apos;s life supposed to come back together? Can a poor man ever marry a rich girl? Or ever be given justice? That&apos;s the plot. It&apos;s a great movie, with emotion as well as entertainment. Raj Kapoor, Nutan, Lalita Pawar, and everyone gave wonderful performances. Nutan looked exuberantly beautiful and matched well with Raj Kapoor.\n\nAnd my god the music! Shankar Jaikishan once again delivers a perfect sound track. Songs like &quot;Dil Ki Nazar Se&quot;, &quot;Kisi Ki Muskarahoton&quot;, &quot;Woh Chand Khila&quot;, &quot;Tera Jaana&quot; and so many more are just classics. Lata and Mukesh at their best once again. The background score is quite touching too. Helen&apos;s dance was a delight as usual.\n\nHrishkesh Mukherjee&apos;s direction is pretty good, and there are many times in the movie where you just have to cry. The relationships between all of the characters just light up the screen. Despite a few extremely sad situations, and some unreasonably evil characters, the direction is very nice. I give this movie an 8.5 out of 10! Watch this classic.",

      "reviewBody": "Delightful! It never pretends to be a masterpiece, but it&apos;s a mini-gem of late-Seventies British comedy. Given that the producers wanted to sell it abroad, it stars an American (the late character actor Richard Jordan), but at least he isn&apos;t the usual dull Hollywood hunk type. Surrounding him is the cream of British character acting talent, led by a wonderfully waspish and superior David Niven.\n\nNiven&apos;s Ivan the Terrible naturally gets the best one liners and all the best reaction shots. He also manages to be surprisingly menacing and intimidatingly dangerous. The moment in the snooker club when he drops the charming facade and threatens Richard Jordan will come as a shock to those viewers who think of Niven as being only a light drawing-room comedy star. He is filled with genuine power and ruthlessness as we see all at once how Ivan earned his nickname. All the more surprising given how ill Niven was at the time. Shortly after filming this production he lost his powers of speech to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig&apos;s disease). This is the last picture Niven made where you can hear his own voice, being dubbed thereafter by the comic impressionist Sid Little.\n\nAlongside him you can spot numerous familiar faces from Seventies cinema and television. Elke Sommer (flashing her breasts in true Seventies era politically incorrect bimbo mode), Oliver Tobias, Michael Angelis, Brian Croucher, Richard Johnson, John Rhys-Davies, Davy Kaye etc, etc. Davy Kaye gets one of the biggest laughs as he holds up a security guard caught making a phone call to the old UK analogue vinyl telephone music service Dial-A-Disc. &quot;Who you ringing?!....Bloody Dial-A-Disc! You gormless git!&quot; \n\nGreat shots of London street locations; making the film a period patina time capsule of red phone boxes with chunky round-dial manual handsets, black cabs driven by &quot;Cor blimey, gov!&quot; cockneys, and ladies and gents modelling all manner of deeply dodgy late-Seventies retro leisure-wear and hair styles. \n\nHighly entertaining, quaintly dated in its fashions and attitudes, and the stuff of late night cult viewing. Perfect to watch at midnight after the pubs have shut; if you&apos;re of a certain age, are feeling a touch nostalgic; and have always wanted to see David Niven swanning about inside a branch of McDonalds, silently intimidating an American via the deployment of a retractable telescope!",

      "reviewBody": "The Tales of the American West and the Western Film are two inseparable American Cultural Institutions. They are highly visible and closely related to each other. Both are exaggerated and distorted versions of American History. Whatever the images we harbor in the deep recesses of our widdle heads, they are colored by people like Zane Gray, Louis Lamour, William S. Hart and John Ford.\n\nThen of course, we have so many types of western film as we have other kinds of genres of stories. So some films are historically correct, some are strictly fairy tale material. So we even have Western Farce, a subject well represented by today&apos;s &apos;victim&apos;, the John Wayne starring vehicle, McLINTOCK (Batjac Productions/United Artists, 1963).\n\nBeing an original screenplay, the story is a custom fit for the Duke, whose Batjac Productions made the picture and released it through United Artists. Long on characters and characterizations, the picture uses the slimmest plot as just a reason for presenting political postulates and providing its audience with many a reason to laugh.\n\nOUR STORYÂÂÂ..It is to be a Great Celebration of the 4th of July in the Western Town of McLintock. Having been named after its local patriarch, the Multi-millionaire Rancher/Farmer/Miner, one George Washington McLintock (the Duke), the town and its people have prospered.\n\nAdded to the mix we have the return from College &quot;back East&quot; of G.W.&apos;s daughter, Becky McLintock (Stephanie Powers-Woo, woo, woo, woo!). Her affections were being sought after by College Boy and Glee Club Varsity Letterman, Matt Douglas, Jr. (Jerry Van Dyke), the son of U.S. Government Agent, Matt Douglas (Gordon Jones). Jerry Van Dyke does as fine a job as ever in doing comic relief. He gives a Stan Laurelesque interpretation to his character.* The biggest development in the whole chain of happenings is the return of G.W.&apos;s estranged firebrand of a wife, Katherine Gilhooley McLintock (Maureen O&apos;Hara), who has a real love-hate relationship with G.W. The climax of the film has an open air domestic &quot;quarrel&quot; that takes Mrs. Mc down the streets of the town, clad in (strictly non-revealing) foundation under-garments, with G.W. in pursuit, ah, it&apos;s true love! Many who have viewed both films agree that this was a sort of obvious attempt to recreate the high spot in John Ford&apos;s THE QUIET MAN (Argosy Pictures/Republic Pictures Corporation, 1952), in which both the Duke and Maureen O&apos;Hara also coincidentally were the belligerents.\n\nIn the viewing of McLINTOCK!, we witness a real hybrid of a production. As we have mentioned before, we have a particular sort of Horse Opera here. It is a true farce. Unlike Mel Brooks&apos; BLAZING SADDLES (Crossbow Productions/ Warner Brothers, 1974), which was a spoof of the Western, the John Wayne film was a farce, all the way. If anything, we can describe it as a sort of &quot;latter day&quot; or modern, if you will, Mack Sennett Comedy. And it is with confidence we offer this thesis, for it seems to have all the same elements; namely, a central hero having some unusual difficulties, family troubles, bad business conditions and high expectations of his ability to weather the &quot;storm.&quot; In the process of getting through the 2 hours, the Duke manages to instruct us on what his ideas were on the way things are and should be.\n\nIf you notice, any Governmental Representative is seen with a dim view, not only of his intent, but also of the underlying intent and outright necessity of whatever their function is. He is obviously a Conservative, a believer in self help. His is truly a far cry from the Cradle to Grave, creeping socialism that we see so much today.\n\nOne thing we do know about Mr. Marion Michael Morrison was his generosity and his loyalty toward his friends, both old and new. In McLINTOCK! We had a film that could have gotten by with a much smaller cast. But if they did that, so many of Mr. Wayne&apos;s friends wouldn&apos;t have a pay day.

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m pretty sure those who want to watch this movie will go for two things; cute little Helen the fox or the Handsome Takao Osawa. For me, what caught my attention about the movie was the ending theme song for the movie; Taiyo no Shita by the Remioromen which was suited the feel good atmosphere about the movie. (Saw the trailer and the music was the instant draw for me to the movie) A poor boy who is left behind by his mother who in pursuit of her own ambition, encounters a little fox after school one day. The two seem to have an interesting chemistry, forged because they are seen as &quot;abandoned&quot; by those who should be rightfully taking care of them.\n\nThe little fox herself (as she was named as Helen later) is a disabled one. Without the right care, you would expect her to fall prey to the surrounding dangers. Yet, the kindness of one little boy led to a completely different fate, one which will leave you smiling when you walk out of the cinema at the end.\n\nI would recommend it for anyone who loves animal or if you&apos;re looking for a movie that has a lesson to be learnt at the end. A simple story that speaks in volume about the importance of caring for someone. If there was a movie that Disney wants to adopt into an American version ... I&apos;m guessing this one has a shot.\n\nOh yah, forgot to mention this, the soundtrack is pretty good too. Aside from the song i mentioned at the beginning, the instrumental soundtrack is well done, and you will remember it for the visuals that accompany the music. I personally enjoyed it for more the audio experience, but that&apos;s just me. :)",

The Second World War affected the lives of our family and of all our neighbors but not in the cataclysmic way of families all over Europe. After more than 60 years this affecting wartime story of a child&apos;s escape by train, desperately trying to protect one cherished keepsake, is still powerfully vivid to me. The next two films I recall were Robert Flaherty&apos;s Nanook of the North, and Man of Aran. I&apos;ve recently seen both of those again. I wish Marie-Louise were available today.",

      "name": "Excellent film but too slow",
      "reviewBody": "For the last film in his trilogy Per Fly has made a very good film about the Danish middle class. For me the problem is that the two first films in his trilogy about the three Danish classes, BÃ¦nken (The Bench) and Arven (The Inheritance) were excellent, while this is just very good. For those not in the know about of Danish society, the Danish middle class is by far the largest class in Denmark and maybe the most boring -at least it seems that way in Per Fly&apos;s film. He may have a point but he certainly hammers it home with a lot of looooong, slow scenes. It works, as some of the scenes conveys very embarrassing moments for the characters and in the process makes you, the viewer, embarrassed as well. Still, that concept was better realised in Thomas Winterberg&apos;s &quot;Festen (The Party)&quot;. The story in Drabet is based on a real life incident: In the 80&apos;s a group of seven well-educated middle class men with leftish leanings committed a series of robberies against banks and post offices all over Denmark and Sweden with the aim to acquire money and weapons for PFLP (the Palestinan Liberation Front, or maybe their mortal enemies The Liberation Front of Palestine - sorry, Monty Python reference there). At a robbery against a post office in central Copenhagen in 1988 they shot and killed a young policeman. The group was eventually caught and tried but since it couldn&apos;t be established who had fired the mortal shot, no one was sentenced for the murder. The whole group did serve jail time for the robberies but have been free since 1995 - not exactly a hard sentence for the person who pulled the trigger. It is certainly an interesting dilemma how you deal with killing someone - even if it&apos;s for a cause you think is just. As usual, the best Danish actor, Jesper Christensen, is doing a delightful job in the lead role, but I still feel the slow pace - even if it&apos;s artistically justified - drags a good film from excellent to very good. Still, I&apos;m sure Per Fly&apos;s trilogy will stand as a beacon for Danish film-making for many years to come.",

Intriguing premise gets a decent treatment on a medium-sized budget. The plot threads are wound fairly tight and the story plays out satisfyingly. Daniel J. Travanti is terrific in support as a wily physicist and time travel specialist with a Cheshire cat-like grin; Kristofferson is quite commendable, and Ladd is frequently amazing. A real sleeper, and an entertaining slice of &apos;80s cinema. *** from ****",

It&apos;s a question of taste but I personally has found this follow up more interesting.The first one was nice but character development took a back seat for the war storyline, I never felt it really got into the skin of little Sebastien and Belle but this time Belle and Sebastien is really deserving of it&apos;s title as the two are now the true heroes of this film and it has a much bigger emotional core because of the Father/Son meeting for the first time and them bonding as the story progress. The new director does a great job, the cinematography still deliver the beauty of the Alpes and it really is a feel good film.The actors are all great, the little boy who play Sebastien is extremely natural and he his in a way a better actor then two years ago. However, I can&apos;t really recommend this film to people who have not watched the first film as it does not make any introduction of the characters, it really is a continuation (The second film in a trilogy). I enjoyed it greatly and am looking forward the third and final film.",

A few others I&apos;ve seen were too long or sought huge and impossible to implement social changes (such as a total redistribution of the wealth). However, this one seems very reasonable in its approach and has the distinction of including many world leaders, past and present, to speak their mind about the failed drug policies.\n\nThe bottom line is regardless of your views on drug laws, it&apos;s pretty much impossible to argue that they are working--and the film does an excellent job in discussing the negative impact of drug interdiction and tough drug laws. And, while you may not agree with everything in the film, it does make you think and realize something should change. Well made and intelligently written.",

      "reviewBody": "Witold (Wit) Braun is the scion of a Polish family of German origin that saw better times between the wars. In socialist postwar Poland they only remain in possession of their old dilapidated mansion, with vast but uncared for gardens being swallowed up by apartment complexes. They live near a large glass factory that used to belong to them.\n\nWit, an engineer with a promising future, works in an industrial complex in ChorzÃ³w, a city in Southern Poland near Katowice. He is estranged from his family, perhaps because contact may be detrimental to his career, but mainly because he wants to break free from the family&apos;s plans for him.\n\nMotivated by a disquieting telegram, Wit decides to visit his family and is given a ride by Marek, a friend from work. The movie shows the interaction of Wit and Marek with Wit&apos;s family over two days and one night. On its face, the movie is about the actions/reactions of conflicted human beings, where Wit represents the future, or at least tries to. It may perhaps be taken as a metaphor for Poland and other European countries where past glories, real or imagined, have many times weighted heavily (and negatively) on day-to-day decisions.\n\nThis is the second full length feature film by director Krzysztof Zanussi, who also wrote the script. Direction is fluid and striking shots are unobtrusively inserted such as the jungle of drafting tables in Wit&apos;s office or a much used Tatra automobile being hemmed in by two shiny black Mercedes limousines. Acting is first rate all around (not unusual in Polish movies) and low key cinematography suits perfectly the action. This is one of the more than 200 Polish movies that have been digitally remastered recently with excellent results.",

      "reviewBody": "Alice Guy was not only the first woman film director, but she may have been the first film director. She also directed the first regular series of sound films, mostly music hall acts in 1905 and 1906. With this movie she bids fair to being one of the first directors of a film travelogue.\n\nEarlier efforts were usually shots of specific locations with an unmoving camera. The Lumieres had set the style. However, with this film, Madame Guy puts together shots from several different places in Spain. In Madrid at Puerta del Sol, The Prado, The Fountains of Cybele and the Palacio Real; In Granada with views of the Sierra Nevada, and the Alhambra; in Seville, looking across the Guadalquivir River; and the Montserrat Monastery in Barcelona. The picture ends with a three minute gypsy dance. Finally, if you look, you can see Madame Guy, dressed in black with children.\n\nAlthough the Lumieres had set the style, Madame Guy was more venturesome. Except for the dance sequence, the scenes are shot with a track shot to offer the viewer a wider panorama. For 1905 it is an elaborate production and important because of the long history of travelogues in the movies.",

      "reviewBody": "In the House (2012)\n\nAnother curious reality shifting movie in the most subtle and old fashioned of waysâthe realism of good fiction. A young writer creates a reality in his essays that is shown as if real on screen. The characters around the writer, and within the fictional story, get intertwined because they are all the same. This game of deception is coy but also witty and warm, and it&apos;s a fun, genuine movie.\n\nI&apos;m not sure how much logic you should try to apply to things here. I assume they have it worked out perfectly, but watching it lightly the layers of reality get necessarily confusing. In a way this doesn&apos;t matter, because you get the general drift. \n\nWhich is this: a literature teacher in high school has a talented student, Claude, who writes fictional essays about real people. One is another student, Rapha, and we see events in this other student&apos;s house because of the writing (and have to guess whether or not those events are fact or fiction). \n\nThe teacher talks to Claude about the content, wondering if it&apos;s fair to lay open Rapha&apos;s life, and the student smartly says that it was written for the teacher alone. This brings the teacher into the story in ways he doesn&apos;t suspect. It also shows the audience that Claude is outfoxing his teacher and we are going to see a game played as Claude&apos;s writings raise reactions in the teacher that affect the fictional plot. Or is it the actual plot? Or both?\n\nExactly.\n\nThe director, Francois Ozon, is no stranger to this type of game playing. The famous earlier film of his in the U.S. is &quot;Swimming Pool,&quot; a remake of an earlier film that has the same tricks played on the audience. It&apos;s never quite enough to have this slippery reality be the basis of a movie, and in &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; the events became quite dramatic and psychologically interesting. The ambitions for &quot;In the House&quot; are smaller and less chilling, and in a way less effective, but also less sensationalist and more believable. We have here more of an ensemble piece, a charmer, a play brought to the screen.\n\nAnd it does rise above mere literary cleverness because of the leading man, the teacher, played by Fabrice Luchini, who will be familiar even to American audiences. His wife is the dependable Kristin Scott Thomas (speaking in French). The two of them make a likable intellectual couple (and her own role as an contemporary art dealer plays a small part in the plot). The way they talk about Claude&apos;s regular installments is how we get to think about the interweaving of realities. \n\nAnd does it ever get interwoven. Keep track of it is you can. Otherwise, just enjoy the show.",

HIGHLY Recommended. Be assured that the Inca Roads portion of this DVD is edited to include claymation during most of the song, this is an important part of the DVD where I would have loved to see the band play. What a lineup including Chester Thompson Genesis live tour drummer, George Duke jazz Superstar Ruth Underwoods percussion contributions are also very worthy and of course little stevie vai, say no more this DVD delivers.",

      "reviewBody": "The Little Tramp is chased into a circus tent during a performance; his antics prove funnier than those of the clowns, and the ringmaster hires him for the show.\n\nWhen a comedian plays a character who is inadvertently hilarious, it can seem narcissistic: just check out Jerry Lewis&apos;s &quot;The Errand Boy&quot; where Lewis has his supporting cast praise the comic genius of the character played by Jerry Lewis. Despite this danger, and despite Chaplin&apos;s off-screen egotism, the premise plays beautifully, especially since The Little Tramp (though not Chaplin) is such a terrible comedian when he&apos;s trying to be one. My favorite moment is when the ringmaster demands the auditioning Tramp to be funny right that instant: the Tramp grins and shyly dances around a bit, gingerly falls down, puts his cane between his legs and meekly lifts himself back up. &quot;Terrible!&quot; roars his would-be employer.\n\nThis film has more self-awareness over comedy conventions that any other Chaplin I know of. The Tramp ineptly (but hilariously) performs a couple of standard comedy routines with the other circus clowns. Later, there&apos;s a funny twist to the old banana peel gag; and near the end he crashes into an old general store, looking as if he&apos;s thrust himself back into his old Keystone days. This is Chaplin&apos;s last true silent film, and the Keystone moment feels like a nostalgic farewell to the past.\n\n&quot;The Circus&quot; is funny throughout, but the opening scenes are probably the best. There&apos;s a marvelous funhouse sequence and a priceless routine where The Tramp pretends to be a motorized dummy. (Has anyone seen the Swiss clock routine from &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;?) He also falls in love with the ringmaster&apos;s cruelly treated daughter, which leads to a poignant ending.\n\nI enjoyed the music, which Chaplin composed for this film in 1969. His scores are always repetitive; but they&apos;re also sweet and funny and they enhance the action. I could have done without the title-sequence song (which he sings himself)âsomething about looking up at rainbows. Otherwise, this comedy is near-perfect and holds its own against Chaplin&apos;s even greater features, &quot;The Gold Rush,&quot; &quot;City Lights&quot; and &quot;Modern Times.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s another cold snowy winter day here so I once again took advantage of our Amazon Prime subscription and picked a flick. This time I watched a film from 1969 called &apos;zeta one&apos; (aka &apos;The Love Factor&apos;). It&apos;s a British made secret agent film...sort of... maybe it&apos;s more a sex-ploitation film. I can best describe it as a cross between the over the top spy films like &apos;Our Man Flint&apos; and the recent Austin Powers films. Also a touch of James Bond. There is a &apos;Barbarella&apos; sci fi element to it too. There&apos;s a race of alien women with advanced technology who want us for mating purposes or something. I&apos;m not really sure. Like so many other B-movie female aliens they only seem to have women in their society. Women who like to dress as male fantasies. Even their warrior women dress in pasties and G strings. Evidently it&apos;s their favorite combat gear no matter how impractical and uncomfortable it must be. Yes, this is one of those movies. It&apos;s loaded with 60s era nudity, mini skirts, boots and even a psychedelic trip or two. It reminds me of the Austin Powers movies because it seems more an exaggerated spoof of the 60s then what it really is, a real 60s film. I lived through that time as a young teen so I know a little. It even had &apos;Laugh-in Style&apos; girls dancing topless in body paint. It&apos;s more 60s then I ever remember the 60s as being, it you can understand that. It&apos;s like what people now seem to imagine those days to be who weren&apos;t there.\n\nAnyway, it&apos;s a funny film if you&apos;re in the right frame of mind. There is one agent who looks like a British version of Barney Fife in round glasses. Their version of M here is more into &apos;S &amp; M&apos;. Yes, it&apos;s a strangely entertaining flick that bad movie fans should enjoy."

      "reviewBody": "And I loved it!\n\nNot just the new take on the King Arthur legend and the able cast, but the colors, the costumes, the landscapes, the horses, and Hans Zimmer&apos;s heart-pounding score.\n\nI&apos;m no King Arthur scholar but I have always been enamored with the chivalric ideals. It&apos;s great to see the knights in shining armor and Merlin conjuring up the mists and casting spells, and the young Arthur pulling Excalibur out of the stone.\n\nBut I went into this movie with an open mind. I was swiftly transported to that earlier time and happy for the journey. I could see where the elements of the now oh-so-familiar Arthurian themes may have had their beginnings. I found the on-screen chemistry between Ioan Gruffod and Clive Owen to be very powerful and it provided poignant counterpoint to Lancelot&apos;s most fateful choice.\n\nThe love triangle was never my favorite part of the Arthurian legends, so the subtle treatment of it here didn&apos;t bother me at all. In fact, I found it more intriguing in this film than in any other King Arthur movie I&apos;ve seen.\n\nI loved that there was no hocus-pocus-type magic. Instead the magic was in nature itself - the landscapes, the forests, the rain, the fog, the ice and snow - all creating an other-worldly atmosphere along with Moya Brennan&apos;s haunting vocals and Hans Zimmer&apos;s stirring score.\n\nI loved the knights. I loved the idea that they were just regular guys and, in effect, drafted into military service. Not the privileged elite who volunteered their services to a king. Yet it is apparent that the Sarmatian knights fought more out of their love and respect for Arthur than any duty to Rome. That comraderie feels very organic and the sentiments, pure. I liked that they&apos;re not all wearing the same uniform, that they might have picked up pieces here and there as spoils of war.\n\nI was especially captivated by Mads Mikkelson&apos;s Tristan. There appeared to be Eastern influences in his tattoos, clothing, sword, and fighting style. I love the idea of Lancelot using two swords. And I learned something about battlefield strategy, too.\n\nWhatever shortcomings this movie may have, I found heart and soul in it. It was not only entertaining, it touched all my senses, and I felt good when I walked out of the theatre.",

Â¨1910, in a remote village, a terrible curse has fallen on the evil Marchioness of Marino and her son transforming him into a bloodthirsty werewolf who preys on the residents of the villageÂ¨. One hundred years on , the only male descendant of the Marino family , returns his village .

After a century of being terrorized by the vicious werewolf, they plan to break the curse by sacrificing him 100 years to the day when the original curse fell . But he doesn&apos;t know the real reason why he is there, to end with an old curse that is been haunting the village for the last hundred years . At the village he meets an old friend (Carlos Areces) , his editor (Secun de la Rosa) , the priest (Manuel ManquiÃ±a) and a bit later on appears his grandmother (Mabel Rivera) . The village of Arga has been cursed and it is up to TomÃ¡s to remove this affliction . The townsfolk need his blood and his sacrifice in order to remove the curse .\n\nThis title blends horror elements with comedy , tongue-in-cheek and action ; so, the tone of the film is light-hearted . Lobos De Arga knows many forms, this film has also been called Game of Werewolves and Attack of the Werewolves which is the United Kingdom title ; if one directly translates the Spanish title into English, then it becomes the much simpler Werewolves of Arga . It&apos;s a veritable buffet of the cream of recent Spanish horror plenty of action , laughs , and werewolves attacks . Likable acting by Gorka Otxoa as Thomas , an unsuccessful writer lured out to a remote rural village who must defeat the villagers and pit his wits against a violent beast in . Enjoyable main cast and agreeable support actors deliver one of the most engaging, hysterical, action packed and wonderfully shot werewolf movies in years . Intriguing and thrilling musical score by Sergio Moure who has demonstrated his particular talent on dark atmospheres such as Â¨The BodyÂ¨, Â¨Thesis on a homicideÂ¨ and Â¨KidnappedÂ¨ . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Carlos Ferro , showing splendidly Galician sets . This Spanish horror-comedy Attack of the Werewolves was much praised by critics as well as public during its European festival run . The motion picture was originally made by director/writer Juan MartÃ­nez Moreno who formerly directed &quot;A Good Man&quot; and &quot;Two Tough Guys&quot; . He clearly demonstrates sound knowledge of the genre he deconstructs with heartfelt accuracy . Rating : Good , above average . Well worth watching .",

      "reviewBody": "A family drama in which a successful stockbroker, married with a young son, is a accosted one night when arriving home by a course, dishevelled man claiming to be his hitherto- thought-dead father, who proceeds to invite himself to stay. The unwelcome guest is not easily waved away and gradually becomes part of the lives of the family. Meanwhile the firm the protagonist works for is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, just as the picture of his origins his mother gave him is shaken up and thrown Into question.\n\nThe set up could be an eighties Hollywood comedy but this is something very different and far more subtle and complex. Somai resists exploiting emotional moments excessively, winning the respect and engagement of the audience rather than milking their emotions for simple catharsis, ultimately achieving a powerful and lastingly provocative film experience. Low-key writing; unobtrusive (and clearly inexpensive) camera work with little camera movement; seemingly little use of additional lighting; long takes; sparing use of close ups - all contribute to the disarmingly intimate experience of the family. This film reminded me of the work of Ozu Yasujiro. All the characters are fresh and unpredictable and there are many moments of humour and pathos, with some chickens in the yard playing an important role. Performances are top notch all the way, including the minor parts which feel like real lives glimpsed rather than decoration.\n\nHighly recommended, and a worthy addition to any fan of Japanese cinema&apos;s viewing experience.",

      "reviewBody": "Based on a best-selling tall story by Jack Higgins, and featuring an all-star cast that must&apos;ve cost half the budget just to get to sign up for the project, The Eagle Has Landed is an enjoyable but slightly overlong wartime actioner.\n\n German soldier Max Radl (Robert Duvall) comes up with an audacious plot to deliver a devastating blow to the Allied forces by kidnapping Winston Churchill from a Norfolk village. A team of deadly German spies, led by Kurt Steiner (Michael Caine), are smuggled into England to carry out this sinister scheme. Aided by an Irish mercenary (Donald Sutherland), the German forces rapidly and ruthlessly close in on their target. Only an inexperienced American garrison, posted in a quiet corner of Norfolk, can stand in the way of a devastating German victory.\n\n The Eagle Has Landed is one of the few films where the all-star cast doesn&apos;t have a detrimental effect. In films like A Bridge Too Far and The Longest Day, the presence of so many stars actually results in a game of &quot;star-spotting&quot;, and this diverts the audience&apos;s attention away from important plot developments. In The Eagle Has Landed, each actor brings depth and charisma to their strongly written roles (especially Sutherland as the devious Irish rogue, and Duvall as an eye-patch wearing Nazi). This film&apos;s faults lie elsewhere. The opening hour and a quarter goes on rather too much and ought to have been trimmed by at least fifteen minutes. Also, the plot rides its luck with increasingly less likely, less plausible developments (especially the unpersuasive &quot;twist&quot; ending). For these reasons, The Eagle Has Landed isn&apos;t quite the excellent film you might be hoping for. What it is, however, is an enjoyable, well-acted and very watchable slice of escapism.",

Perhaps this comparison is a bit unfair, since Happy End came out before the last two and the same year as &apos;The Monkees&apos;, but those were the things that sprung to my mind. Made in 1966, the filmmakers were actually more inspired by the James Bond craze and Beatlemania when producing this hotel bound comedy.\n\nThe three main plot strands play out like typical sitcom episodes: The ladies man hotel owner (Erwin Strahl) has a love/hate relationship with his new female tax adviser while being distracted by the contestants of a beauty pageant. A four man band gets a new drummer (Yvonne Craig lookalike Helga Anders) and set out to prove &apos;he&apos; is really a girl in disguise, and a comical hotel porter (Paul LÃ¶winger) sees James Bond (or Nul Nul Sex as he calls him) conspiracy&apos;s all around the Hotel Excelsior.\n\n It is refreshing to see a &apos;Tiroler&apos; comedy so firmly rooted in the swinging sixties. The humour does not always work, but there are enough colourful costumes and cars to keep things interesting. Therefore we get many musical interludes, a lot of frantic running around and an equal amount of scantily clad girls. So on second thought, this is probably more like an Austrian version of a Beach movie. But why on earth is this film also called Happy End in St. Gilgen? A Hotel can only be in one place at a time?\n\n6 out of 10"

      "reviewBody": "Scream 3 does not have the same writer of the first two, which explains the lack of comedy it had compared to the first two Scream films. It does not have the same great dialogue as the first two, nor the witty and playful tone. However, saying that, Scream 3 is probably still better than 95% of slasher films today. It has suspense and mystery, and although it sometimes goes overboard with how the script handled the &apos;actual&apos; history of Maureen Prescott, I think it overall works well. Neve Campbell once again gives it all she has, and the supporting characters are actually well rounded, especially Parker Posey, which gives the film it&apos;s much needed humor. David Arquette and Courtney Cox are both solid, but I cannot help but question how much their characters( or maybe their motivation as actors) changed, since it really does seem that both feel awkward in a lot of scenes. I suspect it is the writing since a lot of their brilliant dialogue from Scream 2 was missing. Saying that, and while it is true that it is the weakest of the trilogy, it is still a lot of fun and does have it&apos;s clever moments here and there. I do not think there can ever really be a &apos;bad&apos; Scream film."

The plot touches on a lot of educational issues, especially when it comes to disadvantaged individuals moving to different communities. It explores themes of making friends and teachers&apos; perspectives on education, which can really make you feel the pressure. Especially when it comes to race issues, kids are gradually learning throughout their growth what&apos;s similar and what&apos;s different about others compared to themselves. When many people treat someone as special, it creates a distinction and separation between individuals. I can say the first half of this movie can almost be considered a textbook for real-world society. But it&apos;s the second half that really strikes a chord with me. As long as there&apos;s something interesting to others, there will be supporters. Even if the teaching methods of the teachers aren&apos;t familiar, the ultimate goal is progress. How others teach isn&apos;t the issue; it&apos;s whether you&apos;re growing that you need to ask yourself about.",

It is a message to them that generations after them will suffer for their sins. &quot;Tere Bachpan ko Jawani ki Dua&quot; is very apt to this message of the film.\n\nNor will their lives be in peace always under the shadow of the police and rivals. The key dialogue being how saving a life is much much more satisfying than taking a life.\n\nIt is also a message to the general masses not to commit sins against the families of these dacoits in the name of revenge. It will be equally wrong in the front of the law. Instead forgiveness is a greater virtue. Topics like religion of the children and future of the wives and children of these dacoits is also brought up.\n\nBut to convey this message this is far too lengthy a movie. The storyline and the contrived climax are all very predictable.\n\nNor does the film maintain pace with a lot of songs in between. The film could easily have been an hour short. No wonder it isn&apos;t watched or rated much on IMDb.\n\nHowever it&apos;s understandable that the film is a reflection of its times in terms of the message, and perhaps even there length when 3 hour films were the norm.\n\nI rated it 7/10 on IMDB.",

I really liked this movie and this was (as you may suspect) not because it had great technical solutions or unusual movie experiments in it. It was excellent because you do believe what the characters say or think, from the first take till the very last one Ãvegtigris makes you aware of the ironic Hungarian world we are surrounded with. And even though it represents &apos;the great Hungarian reality&apos; it never fails to be funny and make you think. In one word: this movie is a must see and I hope it will be known by vast audiences abroad soon.",

However, I do believe you will find something to chew on here.\n\nIt&apos;s written and directed by noted author Norman Maileer. And it&apos;s tough in every meaning of the word.\n\nThe rough plot sounds like a rather typical noir. An excessively drinking author given to memory blackouts doesn&apos;t know if he committed a murder or not.\n\nBelieve me, it&apos;s not that simple and Mailer takes us down a long winding and convoluted path before we know the whole story. At times, it seems ludicrous, and although I disagree with the Razzie noms it got, I understand. This is the type of movie which some will find inexorably bad.\n\nHowever, it weaves a spell and the tough will stay with it because it&apos;s addictive. You will laugh at inappropriate times and groan sometimes, and yet the very serious film buff will continue watching it, and be glad he/she did. And I do believe that many will find this rewarding although certainly not unflawed. Maybe Mailer wanted it flawed.\n\nAs others mentioned, Wings Hauser is the perfect actor in this. However, Ryan O&apos;Neal gave this his all, and veteran B film noir actor Lawrence Tierney also adds to this.\n\nSome will love it; some will hate it. I did neither, but I did enjoy it. There was a point, the chain connecting the characters in their sex lives and in the chain of violence.\n\nLove it or hate it, I suspect you will remember this one and not consider it a waste of time.",

It&apos;s up there with Crimson Tide and Hunt for Red October. Comparing it to the best sub movie, Das Boot though, one can see why this one is great: It shares the sense of &quot;There might be politics at the surface (both metaphorically and physically) but when it comes down to it, we are alone down here, with the problems, the danger and the decisions&quot;.\n\nGot an 8/10 from me mainly for the exceptional atmosphere.",

      "reviewBody": "Four children ride up a short cut despite their black friend&apos;s warning. They encounter two horse thieves who tell them not to reveal their presence. When a prized mare goes missing, the mystery men are suspected. The oldest kid Helen failed to warn her father beforehand and is distraught by her father&apos;s disappointment. The police gives up the search and ignores the children&apos;s suspicion for the thieves&apos; hideout. The five children decide to search on their own.\n\nI love the Aboriginal kid teaching some bush skills. The danger is not that intense. Mostly, the situations are dangerous but one gets the sense that no kids would ever get hurt in this family film. Quite frankly, the ice house situation is more funny than scary, having the kids hang up like that. It reminds me of a couple of sitcoms with a comedic struggle while hung on a hook. All in all, this is a fine kiddie adventure with kiddie dangers and kiddie thrills.",

The movie breathes the original combination of humor and horror even though the story is utterly new and has little elements from previous stories, it is worth having the title of Griezelbus.\n\nEspecially the kid actors are fit for the job and Willem Nijholt as Reisleider and Count Vlapono is truly magnificent. The only thing I didn&apos;t like too much were the special effects. They seemed a little cheesy at times. Not bad, but cheap. But I doubt the target group will be bothered with that at all.\n\nFans of the genre and especially of Paul van Loon, it&apos;s a must see!",

      "reviewBody": "A bickering young couple and their sexy female friend are snowmobiling in the (Canadian?) wilderness when they run across an old hotel where they are forced to seek shelter from a sudden winter storm. At first the hotel seems to deserted, but then they run into a strange old woman who claims to be the caretaker and alludes to a having couple of &quot;kids&quot; &quot;around somewhere&quot;. As night falls one of the girls disappears and the remaining pair realizes all is not as it seems in the hotel. This movie can be easily written-off as a cheap, Canadian rip-off of &quot;The Shining&quot;, but that&apos;s not entirely fair--it also rips-off other movies like &quot;The Sentinel&quot; pretty severely. And it tries, very ham-handedly, to mine the native Canadian legend of the wendigo (spelled &quot;windigo here for some reason).\n\nThis movie has very little going for it. The plot is pretty dumb and derivative. The dialogue is generally clunky (except maybe for a funny scene where the sexy blonde friend tells a story about seducing a substitute teacher when she was in high school). The characters range from bland to genuinely dislikeable (especially the guy). The girls both look good in their snowsuits but have no nude scenes, which doesn&apos;t have to be a deal-breaker except that the movie has one of those famous non-nude bathtub scenes just to kind of rub in the actual dearth of real skin. The one good thing I can say about this movie is that it does have a pretty effective atmosphere. The gloomy, snowbound hotel is eerie and portentous, even if there is no real payoff to justify all the eerie portentiousness.\n\nThis movie was made in the early 80&apos;s when the American horror film industry was starting to go south (figuratively), and the Canadian film industry, encourage by friendly tax laws, started to go south (literally). This movie is a little more ambitious than most of the Canadian tax shelter projects in that it wasn&apos;t content to be just another &quot;Halloween&quot; slasher movie knock-off. It kind of reminded me of &quot;Death Ship&quot;, so if you liked that. . . It&apos;s hard to find to find these days though and probably not worth looking too hard for."

This movie could be seen as a parody of testosterone-fueled jokes like &quot;The Fast and the Furious,&quot; but it is played so damn straight-forward that it is impossible to take that way. DeCoteau&apos;s genre gender play is amusing and appreciated--for the first 20 minutes, all the male characters are topless, just chillin&apos; at the garage with their buddies, and the two female characters are fully clothed. However, his fascination with buffed &apos;n waxed torsos is more than a little boring. I don&apos;t understand why he just doesn&apos;t go all out and make his films gay with lots of nudity instead of making these straight-forward movies where straight male characters in their scanties rub blood all over each other. Make a real homo-horror, dammit! Nobody wants to watch this crap.",

I like the actors individually, I&apos;ve seen them in many movies, but this one is just not made for them: they all play their role badly. They are as much unfit for the movie as the scenario is riddled with incongruities. Next time, please Mr. Director, take some more time and make the movie accurate and believable.",

I think it is a very unique document for anyone who want s to start a career in acting, even if you&apos;re a man, one of the most touching scene, is when Jane Fonda talks about how many times she did feel or attained nirvana doing a character, the way she felt just before entering the set, and how she felt while she was actually entering in someone else&apos;s soul, absolutely breathtaking! Rosanna Arquette, you surprised me with that very inspiring movie, thank you so much!"

Wes Craven creates yet another horror masterpiece, and does so in an original and unique way. Add in the witty, self aware, reference-filled script by Kevin Williamson, which was rumored to have taken influence from Friday the 13th Pt 6, and you have one of the most iconic slashers ever made. Arguably the greatest opening scene to a horror movie ever, along with so many more iconic lines and scenes (Randy watching Halloween on the couch). The acting is next level by horror/slasher standards and has a very likable cast. Skeet Ulrich giving his best performance of his career, Matthew Lillard, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Drew Barrymore ... do i need to go on? The influence and impact Scream had on the late 90&apos;s is undeniable, simply one of the best scary movies of all time.",

I found it well made and quite enjoyable. Part of its value is in its conventionality. Seeing that he was capable of creating well crafted &quot;popular&quot; entertainments is a plus in his favor. Perhaps he was only working to pay the bills, but I think he may have actually enjoyed making this film."

A movie for hardcore sci-fi fans who will stick it out through all the unpleasant screaming in the beginning, the somewhat bland darkness of space, and the simplistic props and wardrobe.\n\nBut alas, no one wants to use their imagination anymore, so when they see simple costumes they immediately crap all over other peoples hard work.\n\nYou don&apos;t like what this director did, that&apos;s fine. How about you make a movie so we can all see how well you would do...\n\nThis wasn&apos;t a great film, great story, or great acting. The movie IS long and tedious. But the last 10 minutes make it worthwhile as things come together and some questions are answered.\n\nWill I ever watch this again? No. I am content I saw it once, though.",

      "name": "Interesting Blaxploitation Take on The Exorcist",
      "reviewBody": "This was a film that I heard about through podcasts and it has an interesting back-story. It appears that it was pulled from being shown really as is feels like a blaxploitation version of The Exorcist. I didn&apos;t even realize after coming in to write this that it was directed by William Girdler. I decided to watch this for my podcast as I wanted to celebrate Black History Month and the sub-genre this falls into, I gave it a watch. The synopsis is a marriage counselor who becomes possessed by the demon of sexuality when her father-in-law frees it while on an expedition in Africa. He returns home, along with his son and a policeman, to perform an African exorcism on her.\n\nWe start this movie off with Bishop Garnet Williams (William Marshall) on a send off party with his students. I will admit, this is a ham-fisted way to introduce Bishop Williams to us. He is a doctor of theology, amongst other things, and going to Africa for an archeological dig. This takes him to Nigeria where he finds something that is in honor of Eshu, the Nigerian god of sexuality. It is opened and something flees from it. We see it as smoke and wind, as well as flashes of a spooky face.\n\nBack in the United States, a family is moving into a new home. We have Rev. Emmett Williams (Terry Carter). He&apos;s the son of Bishop Williams. There does seem to be a kind of strained relationship that is introduced to us. Rev. Williams is married to Abby (Carol Speed). Helping them to move in is her mother Miranda Potter (Juanita Moore) and her brother who is a detective, Cass Potter (Austin Stoker).\n\nThat night Emmett is woken up by something in the attic and there&apos;s some loud sounds as things are falling. He wakes up Abby and she scolds him for doing so. The two of them make love, but the next morning, something seems to be stalking her in the shower. We then get scenes where she has a violent coughing episode in church while her husband is giving his sermon. She also has outbursts.\n\nAbby is taken to the doctor for tests, but they can&apos;t find anything wrong. Emmett reaches out to his father who is still in Africa. At first, Garnet really doesn&apos;t see anything as too serious, but soon realizes he might be the cause of what is going on. Abby becomes violent and her family starts to fear the worst.\n\nI guess I really should cover the elephant in the room for this film. As I said, it really is a knock-off of The Exorcist. It is the reason I&apos;m assuming it hasn&apos;t had a proper release as the courts ruled this was the case. It is really hard to not see the similarities with just some twists on it. We have Garnet who goes over to Africa and unleashes this entity. It takes over someone and makes them act out of character. There&apos;s the sequence where they get tested, being told there&apos;s nothing wrong and that mental illness could be the next step. We also see the perversion of religion. There are flashes of the demon&apos;s face which were spliced in at different times. The exorcism scene is kind of similar as well, but again all of these things are done with a blaxploitation twist. It is interesting though that they were done the same year, so the only explanation for if things were taken would be that Girdler and Layne had read the novel and this came out later in the year, so possible the movie itself.\n\nDespite the similarities, I like the changes this film does. Not making it necessarily better, but we&apos;re getting to see some different aspects for sure. The first thing is that Abby is an adult woman. She is married and she is a beacon in the church. She just got her license to be a marriage counselor, but even more than that, she volunteers a lot of time there and is a God-fearing woman. On top of that, she&apos;s married to Emmett who is the local minister. I really dig that this movie is having the demon wanting to get revenge on Garnet, who released it as well as someone who could also possible defeat it as well. Instead of having the loss of innocence of a child, we have the corruption of a woman who is living within the rules of her religion. The demon is perverting that.\n\nGoing along with this idea of religion, being that it is showing the culture of African-Americans and I use that term here as Garnet is studying over in Africa. I like that it is combining their past of this African deity of mischief and sexuality with that the more modern culture of black people and their newer Christian beliefs. This is embodied a lot by Garnet as well. During the exorcism scene, he is wearing his Catholic priest garb, but then also dons more traditional African priest clothing over top of it. I took this as marrying the two together in order to save Abby.\n\nTaking this to the pacing, I thought it was well done there as well. It benefits from only running 87 minutes, but I also think that they remove filler as well. There&apos;s a deep story here where Garnet is proud of his son, but there seems to be some animosity toward his father. It doesn&apos;t necessarily delve too much, but I would assume it is because his father is so wrapped up in his work that he&apos;s semi-neglected him. By coupling that strained relationship with the perversion of Abby and the two needing to come together, that also including black culture from the past to the present as well. I think we see the progression of what happens to Abby and where things end up. The ending was solid for what we were building to.\n\nSomething that wasn&apos;t great across the board though was the acting. I&apos;m not going to come down too harsh for the caliber of acting and the budget they were working with. That&apos;s not to say we don&apos;t have good acting. I&apos;m a big fan of Marshall and I just love his presence on the screen. It is great to see him go from Blacula to Garnet here and I just believe him to be this prestigious and respectful man. Carter is also good and I like the growth of his character. Speed is also really good as well. I love seeing her normal and then what happens to her through the possession. She as a few moments of overacting though that stood out to me. Stoker is fine in support. The real issues come from the other supporting actors. They just feel amateurish and I think in part of that is how things are written to be introduce things. Also props to Bob Holt who voices the demon as well, it was quite creepy to be honest.\n\nAs for the effects of the movie, there doesn&apos;t seem to be a lot actually. I like the make-up that was done for the possessed Abby. They lightened her skin and put in contacts which made her look pretty creepy. We get the use of smoke and some other random effects. They don&apos;t really stand out, but for a movie like this, they don&apos;t really need to. It is effective for is being used. I also thought the cinematography was well done also and I had no complaints.\n\nNow with that said, this movie was better than I was expecting. I knew that this is considered the blaxploitation version of The Exorcist. I can see that here, but can also see that this is pretty different in what they&apos;re working with as well. It has some interesting concepts that are explored and they actually ticks off some of my boxes for things I really like to see play out. The acting from the stars is good, but there are some slight issues with supporting players. Not a lot in the way of effects. It doesn&apos;t necessarily need them though. I never got bored and thought it built the story in an interesting way. The soundtrack was fine for what was needed and if I&apos;m going to comment on anything, it would be the creepiness of the demon&apos;s voice by Holt. I&apos;d say this is above average. It has some minor flaws, but overall an interesting piece of cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Piano&quot;, directed by Jane Campion, is a haunting film about love, passion, betrayal and refusal set in the 19th century. Ada (Holly Hunter), sent to New Zealand on an arranged marriage, arrives with her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her precious piano on a stormy gray beach. Her husband Stewart (Sam Neill) leaves her beloved piano on the beach after having decided that it is too heavy to transport it inland. He does not recognize what this means to the mute Ada, who expresses her emotions with the &quot;voice&quot; of her piano. Baines (Harvey Keitel), who has taken on Maori ways, is deeply moved by Ada and her &quot;voice&quot;. He gives Stewart a piece of land in exchange for the piano and offers Ada a deal to earn it back.\n\nRepulsed by Baines&apos; crude appearance, Ada reluctantly accepts the deal to play the piano in his hut while he does &quot;things&quot;. Submerged erotic desires and passion slowly set free between the unlikely pair during the piano sessions. Both Baines and Stewart become obsessed by Ada&apos;s powerful, intensely suggestive form of unuttered communication. Completely bewildered, Stewart asks Baines if had ever heard Ada speak a single word to him, claiming that he could hear her voice in his mind.\n\nThe breathtaking, beautiful imagery as well as its stirring music (Michael Nyman) contribute to the romantic, mystifying atmosphere of the film. &quot;The Piano&quot; won the Palme d&apos;Or at the Cannes Film Festival and Oscars for Best Actress (Holly Hunt), Best Supporting Actress (Anna Paquin), and Campion&apos;s screenplay. Holly Hunter&apos;s outstanding performance conveys impressively a woman&apos;s ability to express herself without words. &quot;The Piano&quot; is one of the best films I have seen so far."

I watched the original French version without English subtitles and although I struggled a bit with the language it was easy to follow even though my French is not fluent. What really surprised me is that the ratings for Borsalino so far have not been higher - as far as French gangster movies go I would consider it within my top 5. It is pacey with lots of action and unlike some French movies,I was never bored once watching it. The combination of Jean Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon as Capella and Siffredi worked very well and Michel Bouquet&apos;s performance as Rinaldi was also very good. My only criticism of Borasalino was that there were too many female characters linked with Capella and Siffredi and we never really learnt more about them as the story progressed. Otherwise a movie I would recommend.",

      "name": "Feminist science fiction that focuses too much on metaphysical questions",
      "reviewBody": "The plot: In a dystopian future, an Asian woman approaching middle age is fired from her job at a creepy multinational corporation because they want a younger, more racially ambiguous spokesperson. How far will she go to regain her job?\n\nThe premise is definitely interesting, and there were parts of the film that I really liked. However, the story continually came back to tedious metaphysical themes that bored me. In the end, I realized that the film was about the metaphysical themes, and this left me feeling a bit unfulfilled. I suppose it was even more so about cultural criticism, especially a feminist critique of how society treats female aging and beauty. But it kept coming back again and again to these questions of &quot;why am I here&quot;, &quot;what is my purpose&quot;, and &quot;is there something insubstantial, such as love, that science can&apos;t replicate in a lab&quot;?\n\nKim plays a woman who must make a life-changing choice. Unemployment is skyrocketing, men are pressuring women to leave the workforce, and older workers are seen as hopelessly out-of-touch with the modern market. In fact, humans themselves are being rapidly replaced, and the only way to secure any kind of hope for your child&apos;s future is for them to attend the most prestigious schools. The alternative seems to be child prostitution. Most of this is established in the background; if you don&apos;t pay close attention, you&apos;ll miss it. Unexplained explosions rock the sterility and eerie quiet of the world, and news reports hint at terrorist uprisings because of a hopeless, jobless populace.\n\nSo, when you lose your job, that basically means that you&apos;ve lost everything. What if your employer offers to give you your job back if you&apos;ll let them control who you are? So, our protagonist becomes desperate to avoid forcing her own daughter to make these same kinds of desperate choices. What can she do but accept? The question becomes what price she has paid. As the film mulls this over, I began to lose interest. Normally, it takes very little for me to become heavily involved in a character&apos;s plight, but, in this case, I struggled. Maybe it&apos;s because I don&apos;t have kids. For a parent, maybe this would be a more harrowing tale.\n\nThere are many admirable aspects to this film, chief among them a woman-centric tale that feels genuine. In some science fiction films, the female protagonist seems to have been written as a male who then gets a gender-flip to mix things up. Or she&apos;s a sexual object for the viewers to ogle. There&apos;s nothing wrong with a bit of exploitative science fiction, but it&apos;s nice to see something with higher aspirations every once in a while. This certainly has that, but it goes so far as to seem pretentious at times.\n\nMaybe this was simply too far outside of my demographic. On the surface, it&apos;s got a lot of themes and ideas that appeal to me, but the focus seems to be diametrically opposed to how I would have done it. Less metaphysics, more world-building. If you&apos;re interested in feminist science fiction, however, this is rare example. You should at least give it a chance if you&apos;re interested in such things. Perhaps you&apos;ll be more intrigued by the themes than I was.",

      "reviewBody": "Dr Cadman saves the life of an old student, Ramsay, by giving him a drug nick named the &quot;black sleep&quot; prior to his going to the gallows. The drug simulates death and Ramsay is believed to have died before the hangman could have his way with him. Cadman revives Ramsay and has him help with his operations mapping the centers of the brain. Of course Cadman is mad, his desire to help his wife who is in a coma, has reduced him to using means that are less than savory. Tension mounts as Ramsay&apos;s good nature clashes with Cadman and the weird things that are going on in the house.\n\nSomehow this little gem slipped under my radar and it wasn&apos;t until recently that I even knew this movie existed. With a cast that would be the delight of any classic horror movie fan (Basil Rathbone, Bela Lugosi,Lon Chaney, John Carradine, Tor Johnson, Akim Tamiroff) this is a one of those movies that they don&apos;t make any more. This is an odd mix of what you think of as classic horror and modern graphic visuals with a moody castle passageways and graphic brain operations and disfigured monsters. It walks that fine line of being link between the Universal style horror films of the 30&apos;s and 40&apos;s and the drive in monster fare of the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s (it feels like a black and white version of the Hammer Frankenstein films or something like Blood of the Vampire) . Its a great deal of fun, and more than a tad creepy and tense since you really can&apos;t be sure whats going to happen next. In its way its a classic of its kind.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the casting of Lugosi, Johnson and Carradine is a bit misleading since Lugosi only has a few scenes as a mute butler, and Carradine and Johnson only show up in the final 15 minutes. They are really no more than cameos and don&apos;t deserve the high placement in the credits they receive.\n\nDefinitely high on my recommend list to anyone who likes classic style horror. This is a movie to search out and enjoy late on a rainy Saturday night.",

Radley Metzger is the only other director I can think of offhand whose sex films invariably have great production values.). Stefania Sandrelli is an absolutely stunning woman, with a gorgeously filled-out body, unlike the skinny-jinnies that many other directors are fond of. The film is set in Venice in 1940 and the locales are beautiful, while at the same time focusing on a &quot;native&apos;s Venice,&quot; rather than the few over-photographed canals and churches one generally sees.\n\nBut the people who did the U.S. version DVD are incompetents, unfortunately. This is only the second DVD that I have watched where the brightness/contrast were so badly mangled in making the transfer that the film is unwatchable until one moves his controls way off their ISF-calibrated positions. To be precise, it is the second-worst. The worst has been the total butchering of Antonioni&apos;s &quot;La Notte&quot;, where even moving the controls to their limit cannot produce a decent picture.",

I could cite so many Bressonian cliches and talk of his uniquely personal style which by 1967 was firmly established, especially since he had abandoned the voice-over he used in the 50s.  I will point out his use of sound and approach to acting which remain so distinctive and by now so familiar.  There is nothing in Mouchette that is new, especially after Balthazar, what remains is the story of Mouchette, told with the utter grace and passion that makes this film a masterpiece that transcends technique, even cinema itself, and makes most cinema look frivolous in the process.\n\nFinally I must mention the films ending, which I rank with that of Balthazar as the most beautiful I have seen.",

Today the government still denies the genetic effects caused by the radioactive fallout located in sector 16. A team of soldiers(Jacob Vargas, Daniella Alonso,Jessica Stroup, McMillian, among them) from National Guard carries supply for a scientific group . But a mysterious unseen deformed humans drag away and attack them. The anthropophagous beings murder and dismember the soldiers one by one, having to combat to survive.\n\nThis unsettling gore-feast contains thrills, chills horror, grisly murders and lots of guts and gore, including, stabbing, impalement, beheading, among others. The killings are gruesomely committed by the cannibal mutants who hold an eerie make-up by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger , an excellent craftsmen.The storyline by Wes Craven borrows from the commandos war movies along with the classicsÂ¨Texas chainsaw massacre(Hooper)Â¨, Â¨The hills have eyes(Craven)Â¨until recent films like Â¨Wrong turn and House of 1000 corpsesÂ¨, and of course the first part directed by Alexander Aja(2006).The creepy maniacal creatures appearance deliver the goods plenty of screams, terror,violence and blood. Atmospheric and suspenseful musical score by Trevor Morris. Colorful cinematography and a little dark during underground scenes by Sam McCurdy. The motion picture is professionally directed by Martin Weisz(Rohtenburg). The tale will like to horror and gore buffs. Rating : acceptable and passable, but isn&apos;t apt for squeamish",

      "reviewBody": "This film is of importance more for its historical value than for its content. What it represents is the only footage of the 1965 Poetry Olympics held at the Albert Hall which turned out to be the catalyst for bringing the hippie counter-culture into being in the UK. Some 5,000 or so freaks, beatniks, hippies and social outcasts of all persuasions turned up en masse, looked at each other, and realised that they were not alone. From this grew the International Times and the whole notion of an underground press, the squatting movement, the re-birth of English Anarchism (as opposed to anarchy) and all sorts of weird and wonderful (or not so wonderful) &quot;happenings&quot; that are nowadays usually lumped under the umbrella of Swinging 60s.\n\nThe actual content of the film leaves much to be desired: shaky hand-held camera on poets whose material, although worthy, was perhaps unequal to the task. Poets are by nature a rather sensitive breed, and for them to suddenly find themselves placed in the role of spokesmen for an entirely new and unprecedented cultural phenomenon must have been more than a little unsettling. Allen Ginsberg was the star of the show, but by the time he got to perform he was drunk. Consequently he comes across as a raving, drooling madman. Maybe this was his intention. But his poetry suffers as a consequence. Harry Fainlight is interrupted by a &quot;lovable idiot&quot; - which is a shame, as, visibly shaken, his performance does not recover. Adrian Mitchell rather steals the show with his unforgettable performance of an anti-Vietnam poem. Michael Horowitz also performs well.\n\nFor students of the period this is essential viewing.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s hard to be a poker fan in the world of movies. Let&apos;s face it, how many great poker movies can you think of? &quot;Rounders&quot; perhaps. Despite &quot;Texas Hold&apos;Em&quot; growing extraordinarily popular over the last few years, Hollywood has really failed to capitalize on the trend. I&apos;m happy to report that the wait is over. &quot;The Grand&quot; not only emerges as a wonderful poker film, but also one of the best comedies I&apos;ve seen in ages. While it doesn&apos;t seem to be well known now, I predict it will find a massive audience on DVD and Cable, ala &quot;Office Space&quot;. \n\n&quot;The Grand&quot; is a mocumentary (in the tradition of Christopher Guest), following six players as they compete in huge Texas Hold&apos;em tournament in Nevada. Along the way we meet many other supporting characters, including family and friends of the main six, as well as other participants in the tournament. The initial six areÂ\n\nWoody Harrelson as &quot;One Eyed&quot; Jack Faro. He is a lifetime drug abuser who has inherited the &quot;Rabbit&apos;s Foot Casino&quot; from his grandfather. A large debt has forced him to enter into the tournament his Casino is hosting.\n\nCheryl Hines as Lainie Schwartzman. She is a mother of five who supports her family (which includes a deadbeat husband) as a professional poker player. She is also the sister ofÂ\n\nDavid Cross as Larry Schwartzman. He is also a professional poker player, known around the circuit for his obnoxious behavior. The fact that his father puts his support behind his sister Lainie only motivates him more to win the tournament.\n\nChris Parnell as Harold Melvin. A statistics expert who uses his knowledge of numbers to his advantage as a poker pro. He is also ludicrously Anti-Social, and lives still lives with his elderly mother.\n\nDennis Farina as Deuce Fairbanks. The old timer who&apos;s been on the scene for years, and has nothing but contempt for what&apos;s become of the game over the past few years.\n\nRichard Kind as Andy Andrews. A novice player who won an online poker tournament by chance to win his seat at &quot;The Grand&quot;, despite knowing absolutely nothing about the game of poker.\n\nSome supporting performers include Judy Greer, Michael McKean, Ray Romano, Jason Alexander, Hank Azaria, and Shannon Elizabeth. Real life Pro players Doyle Brunson, Phil Hellmuth, and Phil Laak also make appearances, as well as filmmakers Brett Ratner and Werner Herzog. \n\nAs you can see, this is a huge ensemble, and director Zak Penn handles it impeccably. Every performance shines, and the pace is fast and fun. I think I laughed three times as much in this film than in any feature all year. The humor is always there, be it in the witty dialogue, the great ensemble, or the various clever scenarios.\n\nAs stated before, the film is structured similarly to a Chris Guest mocumentary, alternating between testimonials of the characters, and following the players around as they play in the tournament. The tournament itself is presented similarity to a telecast of &quot;The World Series of Poker&quot;, complete with mismatched commentators. \n\nI&apos;m not the biggest fan of Penn&apos;s superhero stuff, but I thought he did something clever with his Herzog Loch Ness project. Here, he hits a real sweet spot, creating a real love letter to fans of poker and smart comedy alike.",

The young cast portray the problems of growing up with embarrassing adults very well indeed. The film is helped along by a witty voice-over from Max who pours his little heart out about his worries and fears. Although billed as a children&apos;s film it would be enjoyed by viewers of all ages - think junior Woody Allen! The film deserves to be seen by a wider audience. Highly recommended for the young and young at heart"

      "reviewBody": "Imagine an awe-inspiring vision of an inferno descending onto Earth, with machines and demons decimating the last vestiges of mankind. Such an apocalypse brought to life on the big screen could be something brooding and chilling. It could be epic.\n\nThis is not that movie.\n\nManborg is a cheap, silly, ridiculous little film, and it knows it. It has action, certainly, and plenty of gnarly bloodshed and gratuitous special effects. However, the delivery of the action, dialogue, and the overall story is so over-the-top, so silly, and so cheesy that it&apos;s hilarious. Most of the characters here sound like they came from a Mortal Kombat video game, thanks to the overdubbed dialogue. One character even tries to fight MK style. One lady fights like she came straight out of an anime, complete with cheap sound effects and streaky lines behind her. Most other special effects look like they came from the original Doom PC game, because they are that cheap. The film is short and pretty fast, but more importantly, it made me laugh pretty often.\n\nThe story for this is not an inherently bad idea: I kinda do wish somebody in Hollywood would make a big-scale apocalypse story like this, with the actual forces of Hell being unleashed on the planet (they totally blew it when they adapted Doom). If this same movie was handled with a big budget, big stars, and a distinguished director, it probably would have been awesome. If this movie was a video game instead, it would have been awesome as well. But as it is, the film plays things well within its limitations, keeping things purposefully small-scale and cheap, and simultaneously silly. There are scenes that reminded me a lot of other movies or games - The Terminator, Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, The Running Man, Fist of the North Star, and other stuff all came to mind. Regardless, the film is pretty fun, even if it lacks depth or originality.\n\nThis film is very cheaply shot and edited, with gaudy and weird special effects that looked like they came from the stone age. Acting is very silly and over-the-top, and with dubbed dialogue, it&apos;s rendered even more hilarious. Writing is very silly. This production uses some very cheap sets, props, and costumes. The music score tries so hard to be cool.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for something awesomely cheesy and funny, this film will satisfy.\n\n2.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Marginal | Film: Awful)",

Can&apos;t miss? You&apos;re right; David Lean&apos;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; is a great movie. The casting and acting is superb, every role a standout. I&apos;d read &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; years ago, and watching the movie transported me back to the Victorian London of the novel. Alec Guinness is the perfect Fagin, after seeing this version I can&apos;t think of any other actor ever playing him. Bill Sikes, Nancy, Artful Dodger, Mr. Bumble, and of course Oliver. All perfect. The direction is without peer. The sets and cinematography resemble the best of German Expressionist work from the previous generation. Buildings at odd angles, light playing havoc with the dark shadows. I&apos;m blathering....\n\nMy recommendation is to dig this up in the classics section of the video store and treat yourself to an oldie but a goodie.",

But he&apos;s chased by mistress Loomis (Vera Miles), sister of Marion (Janet Leigh) Crane (murdered previously in the shower). His preceptor doctor (Robert Loggia) will help him for the return . He goes back to the Bates motel and the mansion and the assassinations begin happening again . Meanwhile , he meets an enticing Young (Meg Tilly) who&apos;s invited to stay at home . The doctor (Loggia) will try to solve the awful and ominous killings .\n\nThe movie is plenty of grisly murders , stabbing shots , horror , suspense , shocks and great load of blood and gore but also a little of dark humor . It&apos;s a sequel to Hitchcock&apos;s classic continuing cleverly the plot (scripted by Tom Holland) of the former film . In 1960, psychosis (1960) made over 32 million dollars in worldwide box office returns where as this film made over 34 million dollars . The original house set was used and the motel was reconstructed . The killer/Perkins does an authentic slaughter and are utilized in the gruesome and creepy murders axe , knife , cleaver until the amazing final carnage . The motion picture was rated Â¨RÂ¨ for crude and brutal killings and scabrous violence and isn&apos;t apt for squeamish but abounds blood and guts . Anthony Perkins makes a terrific acting in his classic role . He&apos;ll be forever Norman Bates . Jerry Goldsmith music is good , but he copies to Bernard Herrmann classic score . Dean Cundey cinematography is excellent . The film , shot in 32 days , was well directed by Richard Franklyn who has made various fine terror movies (Patrick , road games , visitors) .",

      "reviewBody": "Berlin is a fascinating place and this film reflects a slice of contemporary Berlin that I haven&apos;t seen so accurately portrayed elsewhere. The film is at its best when it sticks to relatively low-drama depictions of the fabric of the society surrounding the May 1st festival in today&apos;s Berlin. The film-maker focuses on small side stories about, for instance, second-generation immigrant youth, unhappy police officers and a true-to-life Quixotic leftist, left over from political struggles that smack of merely &quot;historical&quot; relevance.\n\nThe film is flawed, unwilling to be satisfied with the sort of gentle drama &amp; humor that works so well throughout. I don&apos;t know the background of the film -- if it is an experiment, I hope the director will decide with me that some parts worked and some didn&apos;t and go on to make more movies in the mode of what worked, here.",

I was totally surprised from the warm and good humor, the stunning camera and the charm full acting of the leading roles. Another point i really like, was the soundtrack especially the old Finnish tango &quot;oriental love&quot;. Can&apos;t take this song out of my mind on that day. A nice and individual film that reminds me a bit on Jarmusch and KaurismÃ¤ki.",

      "reviewBody": "There won&apos;t be any Academy Awards for &quot;Ghost Rider,&quot; and deservedly so. Great cinema it ain&apos;t. It is fun stuff, though, and very much in the spirit of the Marvel comic book of the same name. Nicolas Cage works well in the role; his dead-pan humor is well suited to the role of motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze, and the scene in which he attempts to explain himself to his long-lost girlfriend is classic stuff, full of awkward pauses and an eyebrow put to good use.\n\nGranted, things get a little melodramatic from time to time, but that&apos;s as it should be. This is, after all, a movie based on a comic book hero, and what superhero worth his heat-vision doesn&apos;t indulge in a dose of the melodramatic every so often? It comes with the territory. Still, there&apos;s a sense of humor at work here, something that didn&apos;t play out well in the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise and led to that abysmal third installation. There are a good number of laughs in &quot;Ghost Rider.&quot; This isn&apos;t a movie that takes itself too seriously, which is a nice benefit considering how heavy the subject matter could become. It&apos;s rough around the edges, no doubt, and isn&apos;t quite up to the same level as the Spiderman movies to date.\n\nI saw an early (11:45 AM) show and the theater was still nearly full. The audience laughed at points that were intended as humorous and even jumped at a couple of scenes. All in all, everyone looked like they were having a good time, from the six year olds with their parents to the older folks like me who were fans of this comic as kids. If you&apos;re looking for something fun, &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; isn&apos;t a bad bet at all.",

When it comes to the end of the road, and there is nothing else to live for, hope becomes the meaning. I don&apos;t think it is a good idea to watch this film as a source of documentary, I think it is better to watch this in the state of mind of watching something beautiful/sorrowful/artful/philosophical all at the same time.

      "reviewBody": "Can you really produce a biopic about the theatrical brutality of Britain&apos;s most dangerous prisoner and not incite comparisons to Kubrick&apos;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange?&quot; The trailer for Nicholas Winding Refn&apos;s &quot;Bronson&quot; spouts the likeness triumphantly with a quote attributed to Damien McSorley for the publication, &quot;Zoo.&quot; Surely Kubrick is a flattering filmmaker to have your humble work compared to, though like American director Wes Anderson, who borrows all the style of the man but none of the content, &quot;Bronson&quot; is a film with an air of grandiosity and very little in the way of actual story. Kubrick&apos;s film, based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, has a Dickensian plot that doubles back on characters and scenarios established in the first act, leaving nothing unchanged by the end of the third. It&apos;s a comparison under which &quot;Bronson&quot; unfavorably suffers: well directed, impeccably performed, but completely devoid of structure.\n\nI don&apos;t mean to undersell the above compliments, however. Tom Hardy as lowly criminal Michael Peterson and his imprisoned superstar alter ego Charles Bronson, displays a remarkable, feral intensity in the role, spitting meaty, cockney chunks of dialogue with a truly disquieting voracity. And Hardy makes a perfect match for Refn: both share a larger- than-life approach to their craft. The director&apos;s visual audacity is never more sublimely paired with Hardy&apos;s performance than during Bronson&apos;s intermittent narrations; snippets of a surreal one-man stage show for some great, unseen audience. The cutaways recall the feel of Alex&apos;s presentation following the successful administration of the ludovico technique in &quot;Clockwork Orange.&quot; Swooping crane and sweeping dolly shots, along with some fantastic locations, also evoke Kubrick&apos;s directorial sentiments, as does the more obvious accompaniment of classical score to key sequences.\n\nUnfortunately, the failure of &quot;Bronson&quot; is not only that there&apos;s very little dramatically to be done with a man who spends the better part of his life in solitary confinement, but that beyond a vague notoriety, Peterson&apos;s ultimate goal is never particularly clear. The ending of the film is startling in its abruptness given that the scene seems interchangeable with any number of the fights Bronson picks over the course of the film. It doesn&apos;t feel a particularly epic brawl, and by that point, the tedium of Bronson&apos;s outbursts, battles, and increasingly severe punishments had worn me (though it could maybe be called a statement on the nature of desensitizing cinema--in that respect a reverse &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;) into a sleepy passivity.\n\nThe film is nevertheless a step the right direction for the usually-schlocky and hyper- masculine Refn, but &quot;Bronson&quot; still wants for the substantiality that makes great films great films. It isn&apos;t likely to inspire any further meditation on its subject beyond perhaps provoking a curiosity about the man himself in those intrigued but unsatisfied with the screenplay&apos;s frugal allocation of hard data and social context. But despite the film&apos;s inability to make clear its greater thematic intent, I don&apos;t think &quot;Bronson&quot; is a perversely violent film or that it exists solely as a fetishistic idol to counterculture, as some will likely label it, and have labeled Kubrick&apos;s masterpiece. Its beautiful cinematography (courtesy Larry Smith, interestingly enough, the lighting cameraman for Kubick&apos;s own &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;) and stellar lead may make it a worthwhile rental next year, but as it stands, &quot;Bronson&quot; is a precautionary tale. It&apos;s a film that has everything going for it except the the thing that matters most: its story. And you don&apos;t need to be Stanley Kubrick to figure that out.",

      "reviewBody": "Parinda is a mind blowing film about the underworld. In fact, Parinda is not only about the underworld. It&apos;s also about the human emotions and conflicts that rule their lives. \n\nThe story revolves around Kishan (Jackie Shroff) who takes to the path of crime in order to support his younger brother Karan (Anil Kapoor). Kishan works for Anna (Nana Patekar) who rules the underworld with an iron fist. He is a pure devil who has no regrets or remorse in killing people and whoever dares to cross his path will only meet with one fate- death. Things take a turn for the worse when Karan learns about Kishan&apos;s illegal activities and about his involvement with Anna. Karan proves a real threat to Anna and Anna is hell bent on eliminating Karan who dared to challenge him. However, Anna is also torn between Kishan and Karan as Kishan is his most loyal protÃ©gÃ©. How Kishan tries to thwart Anna&apos;s plans and what happens to Karan and his ladylove Paro (Madhuri Dixit) forms the crux of the story.\n\nParinda is a brilliantly made film. Vidhu Vinod Chopra succeeds in keeping us hooked with the dramatics and what goes on in the underworld. Chopra definitely knows that people don&apos;t like movies made on the crime world. So, he perfectly balances both the underworld scenes and the emotional scenes. The dialogues are praiseworthy. No preaching or overused lines. In fact, this film is the most real picture of the underworld. In a nutshell, Parinda is a masterpiece. \n\nIn a film like this, performances have to be first-rate in order to captivate the audience&apos;s attention. Nana Patekar takes the cake here as he gives a brilliant performance as the hardheaded, merciless underworld leader. Nana gives the correct nuances of a don and his coldness is displayed with brilliance by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Jackie Shroff gives his career-best performance after Hero. He is very likable in the emotional scenes and his turmoil in trying to keep his brother away from his crime life is well etched by him. Anil Kapoor is good in a smaller role. In a film dominated by men, only an actress like Madhuri Dixit can hold her own. She is immensely likable in all her scenes with Anil Kapoor and her scenes more than provide a relief to the viewer after some heavy scenes in the film. Anupam Kher is okay in a shorter role. Suresh Oberoi is good. \n\nThere are only four songs in this movie and they are neatly placed. Neither do they hinder the progression of the story. \n\nOverall, Parinda is a must watch for those who love realistic cinema. It&apos;s a breath of fresh air from the usual 80s Bollywood masala films."

      "reviewBody": "Waiting for Superman does one thing right above all else: it gets a conversation going. Then something else has to matter, which is how much the people who get to talking really know about the education system in America, which has been making students fall behind compared to others throughout the world (i.e. USA ranks 25th among students for math and reading, albeit we&apos;re #1 when it comes to confidence! yey we&apos;re #1!) David Guggenheim&apos;s documentary shifts between personal stories of (mostly) inner-city kids whose parents want their kids to do well but are doubtful for good reason about whether their kids will get the fair chance, and try ultimately to get them into charter-school systems that rely on a lottery system of picking who gets in and who doesn&apos;t.\n\nThis makes up the emotional core of the picture, and it&apos;s a good one. Where things get both interesting and tricky is when Guggenheim gets into the main issue at hand: what&apos;s wrong with our countries schools, especially in inner-city/urban ones like in Harlem and DC where there are &quot;Drop-Out Factories&quot; created in part by students in bad neighborhoods but more-so by teachers who just don&apos;t give a good-damn about teaching. Guggenheim rails against the teacher union&apos;s seemingly monolithic nature when it comes to sacking bad teachers (we learn about the &quot;Lemon Dance&quot; system done with teachers who are tenured who are just bad period). Meanwhile he paints a very rosy picture of the Charter/private schools, and why not? They show how the teachers do give a damn about the students, and the better attention paid - and as we see teaching is a kind of art form that one can master - the better the students.\n\nBut doing a little research before or after the film shows that Guggenheim, for all of his good (and they are good) intentions, omits or shallowly covers certain things, such as the Kipp charter schools (it&apos;s mentioned only briefly in the doc but 1 out of 5 Charter schools really work best at what they do, and not mentioned is how kids that don&apos;t keep up in the first couple of years just get kicked out, period), and about the nature of public school teachers. The call for reform is not unwarranted, and I became saddened by the DC Chancellor&apos;s idea of giving double to teachers who don&apos;t take tenure being shot down, not even addressed, by the NEA. At the same time that Guggenheim gives some strong attention to the flailing public school/public-school-union system, and to how good though competitive Kipp and schools like it are, little attention is paid to what the urban/inner-city neighborhoods are really like that kids like this are in. I question the statement a person interviewed makes about the school system negatively affecting the neighborhoods more than the other way around. To me it would appear to be a vicious cycle where both sides need reform for true change.\n\nBut Waiting for Superman, a film meant to rile up the audience into attention like Guggenheim&apos;s previous doc An Inconvenient Truth, is useful as a way to get people who have no idea what&apos;s going on what is going on, at least the cliff-notes version of it. It isn&apos;t the digging-deepest look at the subject, yet I did feel moved by how the people trying to get by with their kids are good people wanting the best for their kids. Probably the big irony that Guggenheim does, after giving so much positive hype for how charter schools work (i.e. 96% of students go on to college who attend), is showing the lottery system as the climax, and how very few spots there are in the schools. The doc could go even further with being an activist-style position trying to affect change, or give clearer facts; there&apos;s a lot of cute-quirky animation to bring along the information, though the interviewees selected are kind of cherry-picked for its ultimate effect.\n\nIt is, in short, a good documentary but not quite a great one, and will be a big upper or a big downer depending on who you are in the audience, if you have kids, if you&apos;re a teacher, or if you&apos;re in the &quot;rubber room&quot; in one of the NYC schools.",

I remember that I had a crush on him.\n\nThis movie is so totally steeped in Eighties pop-culture. From the first scene where Whitney shuts down the computer (get a load of that thing?) to the hot pants worn by Atkins. The Eighties (especially the early Eighties) was a time when the lines blurred between being gay and straight. Ahh those heady pre-AIDS days...\n\nAt one point in the movie, Ricky (Atkins)responds to his sister complaining about his sleeping around, &quot;I&apos;m 21 years old, I&apos;m right where I&apos;m supposed to be...&quot; And the fashions, man, the FASHIONS. The Peter Pan collars worn by Warren. The red dress complete with puffy sleeves when she goes to the strip club for the first time. The big hair! Pick ANY item worn by Tony... All Eighties, all the time!! And finally - the hottest sex scene that is STILL hot by today&apos;s standards!! The Big Easy comes close.... close, but not quite.\n\nIt&apos;s not a great movie. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s even a mediocre movie. But I DO think it&apos;s an IMPORTANT movie. One day our children will watch this movie and think... &quot;what where they THINKING?!??!&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Exciting and spectacular rescue into Los Angeles destroyed by earthquakes, floods, mudslides, and become a top-security prison . This thrilling picture results to be an inferior sequel to Escape from N.Y. , the latter become a real Cult Movie . It contains mystery , chills , noisy action , thrills , fights , social critical , bits of humor with tongue-in cheek attitude and a weird atmosphere with dark and surprising ending . Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell, he was the only cast member from the original film to appear in the sequel)is once again called in by the United States government (Stacy Keach as officer , Michele Forbes as deputy and Clift Robertson as President) to recover a potential doomsday device from Los Angeles, now an autonomous island where undesirables are deported and finds itself under siege by violent gangs . A previous war hero named Snake Plissken gone rebel must execute a daring adventure and bring up a powerful artifact in twenty four hours . Snake must recover it and along the way facing off villains like Cuervo Jones (George Corraface) . He&apos;s only helped by a sympathetic rogue underling (Steve Buscemi who took the part in this film to help fund his directorial debut, Trees Lounge) , and action women (Valeria Golino, Pam Grier) . As Snake Plissken to get in and out of Los Angeles . \n\nThe film is a comic book plenty of action , fun , adventures , suspense , thriller and surprise-filled entertainment . Magnificent plethora of characters with decent performances by its entire cast . Middle-budget by Paramount Pictures , in fact its President Sherry Lansing was a fan of &quot;Escape from New York&quot; and wanted John Carpenter, Kurt Russell and Debra Hill to make the sequel in the same vein as the original. Kurt Russell as tough and valiant renegade is terrific . At the beginning of the film, Kurt Russell wears his costume from the original film, which still fits after 15 years . Kurt Russell not only came up with but wrote the entire ending of the movie , in fact it was the first and only writing credit . Escape From LA was caught in development hell for over ten years . A script for the film was first commissioned in 1985 but John Carpenter thought it &quot;too light, too campy&quot; . An initial script was written , but it remained dormant until Carpenter and Kurt Russell got together with frequent collaborator Debra Hill. It was Russell&apos;s persistence that got the film made ; Snake Plissken was his favourite character, a character he loved and wanted to play again . Support cast is frankly good such as Peter Fonda , Cliff Robertson , Valeria Golino , Stacy Keach , Pam Grier , Bruce Campbell , Michelle Forbes , A.J. Langer and Peter Jason , Carpenter&apos;s usual . The picture contains an imaginative and memorable production design by Lawrence G. Paull . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Gary B. Kibbe . John Carpenter also made the atmospheric music score along with Shirley Walker . The movie likely to satisfy action enthusiasts and Kurt Russell fans .\n\nDirector John Carpenter is in familiar ground with this well-done tale on the style of comic books and old Sci-Fi serials . His films often feature important visuals shown from a video screen , as the end-of-the-world transmission from the future in Â¨Prince of darknessÂ¨ (1987), the Norwegian recordings of the expedition to uncover the aliens in Â¨The ThingÂ¨ (1982), various TV sets and the general anti-TV motif in Â¨They liveÂ¨(1988), etc. Â¨1997 escape from N.YÂ¨ was realized during his best period in the 70s and late 8os when he directed classics as Â¨HalloweenÂ¨, Â¨The fog Â¨, Â¨ChristineÂ¨, Â¨They liveÂ¨ , Â¨Big Trouble in Little ChinaÂ¨ and Â¨The thingÂ¨ . The sequel Â¨Escape from L.AÂ¨ rating : average but entertaining . The movie will enjoy to noisy action fans but packs a roller-coaster thriller and wholesome amusement . The film will appeal to John Carpenter enthusiasts . A third sequel was going to be made titled Escape from Earth which would have had Snake escaping Earth after a dark matter experiment. However, the negative reaction to this film prevented the sequel from being developed. As the movie was a notorious failure on release, making around $25 million , just half its budget , at the US box office. Many reviews criticized the film for being too violent or for being too similar to the original film .",

      "reviewBody": "Is the movie great? No, but it is a good one. If it were great, it would not suffer from it&apos;s long running time. A wider audience would no doubt warm to a shorter version. More is the pity, too, because the movie has much to offer. The scenery is beautiful; the sets reconstructions are first rate. Listen to the lyrics of some of the songs (&apos;Gold Fever&apos; and &apos;The First Thing You Know&apos; are two good examples) and you can appreciate the wordsmithing skill of Alan Jay Lerner. If you like a large all-male chorus, the film offers some of the best singing of that kind you are likely to hear. Listen especially during &apos;There&apos;s a Coach Coming In&apos;.\n\nI must confess a guilty admiration for characters who are unapologetically amoral and corrupt, at least as defined by &apos;respectable society&apos;. I wouldn&apos;t necessarily want one for a neighbor or even a friend (well .. maybe), but they are fascinating on film or stage. If the film is a comedy, they can be hilarious and often steal the show. All you need is the right actor to fill the role. Paint Your Wagon offers one of the most uproariously amoral characters on film, brought to amazing life by Lee Marvin. He delivers Ben Rumson&apos;s imminently quotable home-spun philosophy of life with great relish and comedic timing. Can he sing? No. But then would a somewhat dissipated Gold Rush miner likely be a good singer? His non-singing actually fits.\n\nThe rest of the cast is good but not exceptional. Ray Walston is memorable as Mad Jack. I still find it hard to spot the actor I am used to behind the beard and accent. He also has some great lines. Harve Presnell is the only truly major-league singer in the cast and delivers the most memorable song. The remaining actors are adequate. Eastwood is good but replaceable. Jean Seaberg is not Meryl Streep but is certainly easy on the eyes. The townsfolk are solid.\n\nAn enjoyable movie, with Lee Marvin&apos;s performance worth the price of admission. It is too bad it requires such a long time commitment to experience it all."

      "reviewBody": "New York City. The Footlights Club is a theatrical boarding house where young women wait for the chance to make it big on Broadway. To deal with the disappointment &amp; bitterness that can set in, they engage in wisecracks &amp; gossip. Fiercely loyal to their friends, they can be wickedly spiteful to those that cross them. Always before them is their dream - to capture elusive success at the STAGE DOOR.\n\nA wonderful film, fresh &amp; sparkling, with great dialogue infusing its wit &amp; drama. The rapid-fire cross talk is still a real treat for viewers - as is the chance to see several fine young actresses early in their careers.\n\nThe entire cast is excellent. Brash Katharine Hepburn is the new girl who quickly meets the `regulars&apos;: feisty Ginger Rogers, cynical Lucille Ball, wisecracker Eve Arden, lively Ann Miller, snobbish Gail Patrick &amp; sweet Andrea Leeds. While the young ladies certainly get most of the attention, be sure not to overlook Constance Collier, terrific as Miss Luther the has-been actress. Growing old on bittersweet memories, she is a constant reminder to the others what, even with success, they still might become.\n\nAdolphe Menjou gives his usual vivid performance as an immoral producer, while Samuel S. Hinds is good as Hepburn&apos;s father. Film mavens will enjoy spotting several familiar faces in uncredited roles: Jack Carson as a Seattle lumberman; Grady Sutton as a butcher&apos;s helper; Frank Reicher as a stage director; Franklin Pangborn, hilarious as a butler; and Ralph Forbes in the role of Hepburn&apos;s stage spouse.",

Don&apos;t watch it expecting too much though, and you&apos;ll probably only want / need to watch it once, but nevertheless, it&apos;s a fun, although at times slow, watch. Allison Lange makes her film debut here, and is rather good as Christina Tarling. Yes, the film is about her house and the strange going-ons that take place soon after she and her brother (Lorne Stewart) and father James (the excellent John Savage) move in.\n\nChristina deals with typical teenage issues, such as pressure from her boyfriend Eddy (the charming Brendan Fehr), her trouble making brother, problems between her father and boyfriend and so on. The Sheriff begins to investigate the disappearances of several teens who were all last seen at Christina&apos;s house, and in typical small-town Sheriff convention, he is not the nicest of men. Jerry Hasseman does a good job playing him. Crystal Buble is okay as Christina&apos;s friend Karen, and Brad Rowe is suitably creepy as the mysterious Howie.\n\nThe ending to the film is somewhat of a let down, and at certain points the film leaves you wanting more, or a better explanation, but overall, a good effort from all involved, and the cast are great to watch.",

For the most part, including myself, this movie caught my interest because within its cast was a very young Angelina Jolie and Johnny Whitworth. I didn&apos;t care much of what the story was about; that is until I finally reached the rolling of the end credits. Quite honestly, I don&apos;t understand why people can&apos;t find the value in this movie. It is certainly not rock solid entertainment, but it hits harder than most low budget dramas.\n\nThe story may not be about the most common of situations but it is relateable to an extent. A group of friends made a bad decision by trying to pull a robbery and end up causing friendly fire and another friend goes missing. This leaves with one of the friends, Johnny Miles (Mekhi Phifer) being jailed, and the other two, Gloria (Angelina Jolie) and Patty (Johnny Whitworth) to deal with family issues. But it&apos;s when five years later that come around, that old wounds will open but will also be cleansed for the final time.\n\nThe majority of performances are well done. Whitworth, Phifer, Jolie and even Rosanna Arquette, who plays Jolie&apos;s mother, all give real-human performances for the kind of drama these characters have to go through. The only character I didn&apos;t find that human was Lou Reilly (William Forsythe). He held the same facial expression through the entire film. Not one smile. And what&apos;s with his hair? But I digress. I also liked how Tony Cinciripini wrote how each subplot would tie the loose ends by the end of the film. It was nice to see the end result of the film because it combined everything into one. That&apos;s not to say every subplot was well written though.\n\nWhen it came to family/friend issues, yes I felt there was a real story being told. But when it came to Miles wanting to box, there wasn&apos;t much explained about why he wanted to do boxing and how he met Lou Reilly. Plus, when Miles asked Reilly to be his agent, Reilly refused but by the next scene, he was being trained to box. I don&apos;t get it, where&apos;s the transition? Why did he change his mind? What made him change his mind? Why, why, why? There was also no recompense for the actions of various characters. There would be scenes of criminal acts or threats and yet no one would get in trouble for it. I find that hard to believe.\n\nAs for music, the composer Joseph Arthur did not provide a theatrical film score, which is understandable for the budget that was provided. But I was actually not so displeased with the turnout. Throughout the film, acoustic songs will be played. There is also a song that is played every now and then, so that could be considered a theme. What I liked about it is that it gave a human characteristic to the story. This made it feel a little more down to earth, so perhaps an orchestral score would have made seem less realistic. Either way, it&apos;s a fairly decent film.\n\nThe performances carry the right emotion and the music assists in making the drama feel that much more real. Unfortunately, the writing has its weak points and doesn&apos;t allow for any explanation.",

Granted, there are still some of those today (2004), but it just wasn&apos;t the same as back in the day. Now there are so many special effects in the current action films that it drowns out what used to be the great style of a &quot;popcorn flick&quot;.\n\nDie Hard paved the way for these type of movies, and some of the offspring of this did well and did not. The Last Boyscout was one that did well. This was a very intelligent and fun action/thriller/buddy-comedy that can still be enjoyed to this day. Tony Scott is the master of under-appreciated action movies in the 90&apos;s, such as this and True Romance. \n\nMy suggestion is to get a 6-pack, go rent this movie, sit back and enjoy the ride.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie communicates only bits and pieces of what the book itself does. It doesn&apos;t show well the actual character of Haller at all and, not understanding his personality well, the rest of the film doesn&apos;t pass on the original message very well except through occasional one line sum-ups of an idea by a character. This movie includes tons of lines taken directly from the book but I found that the movie uses some of the weaker lines at times while leaving out most of the best. I found the first half of this movie to be utterly boring however the second half was moderately well done. I like the feel to the second half although I barely made it through the first. That said I give this 5 stars because of the nice surrealism (really psychedelic more than just surreal) and I found the film to be overall very poor considering the material its based. I don&apos;t particularly like some of the acting selections either. Overall if you just read this book or ever have for that matter I would say don&apos;t watch this film because it leaves me with much less feeling than the book did and really calmed down some of the feelings racing in me for days after reading the book. If you&apos;ve never read the book I would say watch the film but know that the book is a masterpiece and this film is not. But like I said if your into psychedelic feels to films this has plenty to offer there. All that said I believe my review is biased because of comparing it to the book and had I never read the book some of the ideas presented in the film would have really hit home. But that&apos;s not hard to do when your script is pretty much taken directly from the book. I think being disappointed is what I feel. I also particularly dislike the scene with the war against machines where in the book the attorney or whatever he was was (I forget) wasn&apos;t treated the same as in the film. I think the last few sentences of Gustav and his conversation in the book really hit at what was being said in that section and that the film didn&apos;t.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Jaded&quot; should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like &quot;Indecent Behavior&quot; or &quot;Friend Of The Family&quot;. \n\n&quot;Jaded&quot; is not an easy watch as it&apos;s story is difficult to conceive and it&apos;s not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. \n\nThe raping scene wasn&apos;t (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn&apos;t use proper camera techniques overall in the movie. That&apos;s why it looks sometimes dull and becomes boring almost near the end.\n\nThe performances are extremely good from all the five female characters. These women gave strong, intense, but believable performances that demonstrate the actresses&apos; dramatic abilities. \n\nThe legal concepts helped a lot to understand the plot&apos;s difficulty because the legal term of sodomy is different from a simple raping. From the point of view of Meg&apos;s defense, sodomy needs to be penalized as a raping (a huge crime grade B) although it&apos;s a different crime. Pat and Alex&apos;s defense claims that Meg enjoyed and asked for it. This is where the movie turns interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. The only thing for sure is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime. \n\nWatch &quot;Jaded&quot; if you like legal issues that aren&apos;t very common in your society. If not, give it a try because it&apos;s a very good and strong drama.",

The morning after a rowdy banquet, Kiki, an escaped slave, takes shelter under Kashma&apos;s roof. Word comes that the wicked Caliph is looking for her; but Kashma, by this time in love, flees with her to his father&apos;s palace. Alas, there&apos;s more to Kiki than meets the eye. Will the evil schemers succeed? The sons of the Forty Thieves to the rescue! ..\n\nTony Curtis stars as Kashma Baba, the son of Ali Baba, and he&apos;s quite good in his role. His Bostonian accent isn&apos;t as strong - probably made an effort to reduce it when he sprouts the usual Orientalist version of Arabic English - and he wields a fare sword in some nifty action scenes. The plot is fast moving, unravels the story like a turban&apos;s thread, and has some good villainy in Victor Jory and Hugh O Brian. There&apos;s excellent photography, set-designs, costumes. Piper Laurie is beautiful as the love interest, but it&apos;s Susan Cabot who really steals the scene as an archer and friend of Kashma. It&apos;s a fun film.",

      "name": "Possibly the greatest of the early eighties dorm slashers...",
      "reviewBody": "By far my favourite of the early eighties dorm slashers, THE PROWLER is an excellent and exciting film brought to the screen with finesse by Joseph Zito. He also directed arguably the best of the FRIDAY THE 13th sequels - The Final Chapter. He shows us his love for the hack and slash cycle here, by renewing a few scenes from two of the genre&apos;s pioneers. You&apos;ve got the &apos;murder in the shower&apos; fresh out of Hitchcock&apos;s renowned classic PSYCHO. Here Zito makes it a lot more brutal, with some realistic and visually stunning gore effects from horror maestro Tom Savini. And then there are various references to Carpenter&apos;s HALLOWEEN, including the assassin digging up the grave of the victim he killed some 35 years earlier. Michael Myers steals his sister Judith&apos;s headstone from her grave when he escapes from his 15 year spell in Haddonfield&apos;s asylum. But although there are brief nods to his obvious influences, Zito also manages to supply some originality and some genuinely scary sequences. Back in the day it was thought that he was going to be the next Tobe Hooper after his flawless work within the horror genre. But sadly he went on to work with more action-orientated films such as Missing in Action, Red Scorpion and Invasion USA.\n\nThe plot is believable and also extremely well written. It opens with black and white footage of GIs returning victoriously from WW2. Cut to a letter from a girl named Rosemary to an unseen receiver, stating how she &apos;does not want to hurt him, but could wait for him no longer...&apos; In other words someone&apos;s been dumped and it looks as if a few people are going to have to suffer because of it! Again cut to Avalon Bay Graduation dance 1945 and we&apos;re shown the lady Rosemary for the first time with her new &apos;fella&apos;. While the host merrily talks about Glenn Miller&apos;s death, Rose and her cocky boyfriend head out under the stars for a spot of good old harmless (or extremely harmful in these films!) huggin&apos; and a kissin&apos;! They choose a spot at the end of a brightly laminated pier and continue to smooch the night away under the stars, unaware that a somewhat unfriendly looking guy disguised in GI garb and brandishing a bowie knife is watching their every move! Suddenly the lights go out, and Rose and her partner are brought a little bit closer together...Both impaled on a pitchfork!\n\nSkip 35 years and Avalon Bay is preparing for the first graduation dance since the fateful events that occurred before. While the young enthusiastic teens are shown getting ready to find romance at the dance, it looks as if a certain unknown someone is preparing for another bloody massacre. One girl unknowingly predicts the events that follow while she&apos;s getting dressed for the party by saying to her sulky looking friend &quot;Hey you&apos;re not gonna mope about tonight are ya? Some of us will never see each other again...&quot; Her remarks prove to be surprisingly accurate!\n\nTHE PROWLER is often pipped in the popularity stakes by the same year&apos;s similar slasher MY BLOODY VALENTINE. Many reviewers also find the latter to be the slightly better of the two. However I beg to differ, because even though MBV is a decent enough movie, I find this to be a scarier and for the most part more sinister attempt with a much stronger cast. Zito&apos;s spooky direction is superb and Savini&apos;s &apos;almost too realistic&apos; gore touches just round it off perfectly. There are a few jumps to increase your heartbeat and I strongly wouldn&apos;t recommend any young femme fatale who&apos;s trying to grow her finger nails to watch this flick alone, because there are a couple of scenes when I guarantee you&apos;ll be biting them off!! One of my favorite ever murder scenes is also in this flick, the excellent swimming pool killing. A female teen who is bathing by herself under the moonlight paddles over to the ladder to climb out of the pool. She reaches the steps and begins to ascend them when all of a sudden she is brutally kicked in the face. She finally comes back to her senses and looks around to see who attacked her, but no one is anywhere to be seen! The silence is broken when the killer jumps out of the water behind her and gorily slices her throat in amazing detail. Watch for the blood that leaks out of her wound as her lifeless body sinks in to the murky depths of the cold water; it&apos;s Savini at his best...Excellent! The cast are also superb, which, must&apos;ve helped the general production no end. Veteran actors Farley Granger and Lawrence Tierney have small roles, but the real &apos;round of applause&apos; goes to fresh faced newcomers Goutman and Dawson who actually steal the show. It&apos;s only a shame they never went on to do much worth noting in the movies after this.\n\nAll in all THE PROWLER is everything a slasher should be dark, scary, gory while at the same time fun. It&apos;s incredibly underrated so I would most definitely recommend it, try and hunt down a copy if you can and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"

      "name": "Typical Kawajiri Film, (a good thing)",
      "reviewBody": "First things first, this is a typical Kawajiri film, as you may or may not know, Kawajiri is like a Japanese Frank Miller, meaning all his work share a distinctive feel to them, and follow a similar path story-wise. Some people call this auto-plagiarism, and bash it. However if you are like me, and have really liked his work, from Ninjascroll, to the Animatrix short, from &quot;wicked city&quot; to &quot;vampire hunter D bloodlust&quot;, &quot;lens-man&quot;, &quot;Cyber city Oedo&quot;, etc etc. Then the mere prospect of watching some part of the highlander myth animated in this fashion will have your blood boiling. If you haven&apos;t guessed it yet, I really liked the film.\n\nLets start reviewing it part by part.\n\nStory: It fits in the Highlander myth, this is not about any known Mcleod, so you may think of it as an alternative story-line. Everything is a little clichÃ©d though, still beats the crap out of any Highlander sequel so far.\n\nSetting: The movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, very kawajirish, it has this &quot;Fist of the north star&quot; feeling to it, huge bad guys, wrecked urban landscapes, silent heroes, you know the drill.\n\nCharacter design: Again typical kawajiri film, busty women, sharp factions, impossibly muscular males, you may love it or hate it, I really like it. This is no Inuyasha, boy....\n\nAnimation: Very Good, some less than stellar CG shots, and &quot;matrix moments&quot;, if you can deal with that there are really well choreographed fights to be seen. Specially gorgeous are the fights that take place in the past.\n\nSound: Mostly OK, some voice overs could have been better, the movie comes in English just like Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust. There are some great accents to be heard when the Highlanders speak, however some secondary characters could have used better actors.\n\nMusic: Gorgeous, really symphonic gives the feeling of epic and greatness to the whole movie.\n\nSo if your love for highlander allows you to overlook some small flaws, and some kawajirisms you&apos;ll really like the movie.",

I mean, I knew the story it had followed and though I wouldn&apos;t say it was accurate it was still pretty good. The singers they chose were fabulous and it incredibly amusing to watch Fillip play a devil because he turned out to be a great one. Most of the songs were very good and I vowed to find them someday but there were some that were quite unemotional and, in fact, boring. But in overall, this is worth a check and it may bring some entertainment to you. Still, it&apos;s best to watch on the 31st of December rather than any other time of year. Gives you &quot;the&quot; feeling. Worth a check. (I very very much doubt there is even a version with subtitles though)",

Her acting, as well as that of the actress who plays Marion Monks, was outstanding.\n\nLeft a widow with seven children, Agnes Browne, is undaunted in her spunk and determination to rise above adversity.  Agnes&apos; best friend nearly steals the movie with her believable, heartwarming performance as the down-to-earth, pungently irreverent, Marion Monks.\n\nThe children, (all seven of them) never seem like actors.  The French baker next door also adds flavor as the love interest.\n\nWorking-class Ireland in the poor section is seen realistically but with much more kindness and hope than Frank McCourt&apos;s world of Angela&apos;s Ashes.\n\n Excellent and underrated film--highly recommended.",

      "name": "Distinct flaws can&apos;t fully dampen what is mostly a very fun sci-fi action flick",
      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s always fair to wonder just how accessible a film might be for those who have no familiarity with the source material. For example, I heard of &apos;Dirty Pair&apos; about five minutes before finding this film, nevermind the light novels, or any other subsequent adaptations. The good news, however, is that the 1986 flick swiftly shows itself to be the sort of piece that requires no prior knowledge at all; beyond a smidgen of exposition to establish the setting of civilization spread throughout the galaxy, we have two heroines set out to tackle a matter of intrigue, and action scenes will follow. That&apos;s it. What remains is the question of quality: of the writing, and of the animation, and if we want to get more specific, of the action, any comedy, and other minutiae. All told it&apos;s safe to say that &apos;Project Eden&apos; is no major must-see of science fiction or anime, but it is duly entertaining just as it intended, and sometimes that&apos;s all a film needs to do to succeed.\n\nThe animation isn&apos;t the total top of the line, and techniques and technology have only improved in the years since. But then, studios in Japan have long demonstrated a mastery that their counterparts elsewhere can mostly only dream of, so &quot;not the total top of the line&quot; still equates to &quot;meeting or beating a very high standard.&quot; By and large the backgrounds and environments of all stripes are utterly gorgeous, filled with detail and texture, and much the same could definitely be said for the designs of active elements including creatures, machinery, and so on. Character designs don&apos;t necessarily benefit from that same high level of consideration, and tend to reflect the more cartoonish side of the medium, but are still just swell. Any effects look great, and the action is fluid and suitably exciting. The visual experience here is quite sharp and imaginative, really, and it only especially falls short if we deign to compare it to the anime of years to come - which is, of course, no fault at all.\n\nI&apos;m less pleased with how protagonists Kei and Yuri are treated. In general there&apos;s no good reason at all for these highly competent agents to be dressed in skimpy, revealing clothes except &quot;Intended Immature Male Audience&quot;; in particular, the script and storyboards pointlessly and tiresomely accentuate how physically weak they are, even working in concert, compared to a single adult man. Emphatically gender-based quips about their weight, intelligence, capabilities, and suggested obligatory infatuation with A Man are intended to be funny, but boy howdy, they are not. The narrative and scene writing are also rather gawky, as seen in the romantic element that is far less than believable, or when antagonistic Professor Wattsman decides to talk out loud Just Because and thereby vomit forth a metric ton of plot; this operates with the storytelling logic of classic &quot;Saturday morning cartoons,&quot; and not the good kind that respects the intelligence of their viewers. For all the value that the feature genuinely has to offer, such juvenile and ill-considered notions have not aged well, and there are definite upper limits to the entertainment in these eighty-odd minutes.\n\nStill, &apos;Project Eden&apos; wanted only to entertain, and I&apos;d be lying if I said it didn&apos;t. The creature designs, and those of machinery, feed right into the action sequences, which really do tend to be fairly exciting, moreover infusing a measure of sci-fi horror into the proceedings with the gnarly visions to greet us. Whether a scene is built for comedy, action, plot development, or even just visual spectacle, there are small strokes of brilliance all throughout, in every way, and sometimes I&apos;m downright impressed by the cleverness that went into the movie. While its execution leaves a bit to be desired, the story is strong on paper, a tale of science gone mad - with wider, dangerous ramifications - that Kei and Yuri get swept into while investigating competing claims by two rival governments. Though the dialogue and especially the characterizations have major room for improvement, overall the scene writing is just as strong. The writing could stand to be tightened, but in those ways that matter most Hoshiyama Hiroyuki&apos;s screenplay is fairly terrific, and while the ultimate shape of the picture has problems, we definitely get the lark of sci-fi action that we want.\n\nIt&apos;s well worth also mentioning the dynamic, flavorful original music of Shiguma Kenzou, an unexpected highlight. With themes ranging from invigorating 80s rock, to ambient soundscapes, to potent piano- or synth-driven chords, to more conventional orchestral arrangements, Shiguma lends substantially to the vitality that the title has to offer. He sustains the broad lighthearted tenor, and by all means, this could have gone darker if it wanted to with the music to match. That&apos;s just it, though: this is a fantastic example of how a score helps to give form to any work in cinema or television. The pure 80s pop is maybe a tad much, and replacing them with more of the composer&apos;s ingenuity would have been a better move in my opinion, but even these tunes are not bad in and of themselves. This is to say nothing of keen editing, robust sound design, commendable voice acting, and so on - but really, if the entirety of the film had been as carefully considered as Shiguma&apos;s contributions alone, or for that matter the preponderance of the animation, then this would have found more fame as an anime classic that was all but flawless.\n\nIt&apos;s not flawless, sadly. Outwardly frustrating as the treatment of Kei and Yuri is, and the clunkiest instances of the writing or storyboarding, they become more so for how they diminish the strength of what is otherwise a very solid viewing experience. With just a little more careful consideration in select ways, the end result would have been even better than it already is, and this further includes the ending which suffers from frankly outrageous tonal confusion. Still, dubious as some facets are, the good far outweighs the bad here, and I only wish that there were no such issues in the first place. Some odds and ends may not have aged well, or may not have ever been appropriate in the first place, but troubled as the sum total may be the saga of sci-fi action provides all the fun we want. It won&apos;t appeal to all comers, and it doesn&apos;t demand viewership, but provided one is amenable to genre fare that falters, there&apos;s a lot to like in this &apos;Dirty Pairs&apos; movie, and it&apos;s worth checking out on its own merits. Don&apos;t go out of your way for &apos;Project Eden,&apos; but it&apos;s firmly enjoyable, and that&apos;s enough.",

She&apos;s got the petulance down pat, pouting throughout what is supposed to be her great dramatic role (musicals being her forte). MGM obviously hoped that this would prove to be a turning point in the way of future dramatics for the usually sunny June.\n\nSeems she&apos;s supposed to be despondent over losing her dead father at an early age, unable to accept his death and unwilling to depart from his memory (like him, she plays piano constantly), unable to accept her step-mother, CLAUDETTE COLBERT, who is concerned about Allyson&apos;s psychosis--especially when Allyson starts imagining that Claudette&apos;s love interest (WALTER PIDGEON) is in love with her.\n\nTo give it class, MGM made sure they used some classical music for Allyson to play, gave it elegant sets and an overall polished look that might have worked well on a better film. But this is so obviously supposed to be a psychological tear-jerker to give Colbert and Allyson strong dramatic roles. Unfortunately, the contrivances are so pat and the overall effect so absurdly superficial that all you can do is hope JUNE ALLYSON will get over her dramatic ambitions and do the things she does best.\n\nNice cast, including ROBERT STERLING (as Allyson&apos;s more sensible brother), PATRICIA MEDINA, MARSHALL THOMPSON and LIONEL BARRYMORE (as a crusty old doctor), helps somewhat, but nothing can disguise the fact that they&apos;re all wasting their time in a phoney melodrama adrift in the usual Hollywood psycho-babble meant to be taken seriously.",

Everything about it shines, from the scenes of childhood in flashback to the suspenseful and tense train trip, I watch this film over and over waiting for one scene: the scene between Fonda and Redgrave in the Berlin restaurant. I just saw it again two hours ago and once again I was in awe of the acting, from both stars, some of the finest work of their careers, the direction of the scene and the spare, intense writing.\n\nWhether the story itself was factual or not (Hellman might just have made it all up!) it works on so many levels that it&apos;s still worthy, and its truth or falsity just doesn&apos;t matter.",

      "reviewBody": "Love Ke Liye Kuch Be Karega While I was roaming around at the video store, I happened to find this in the new releases section. I first took a look at the cast list and was quite impressed with the star list. With names like Sonali Bendre, Aftab, Fardeen Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Twinkle Khanna, and Dilip Tahil, I was amazed to see a multistarrer of such proportions. What really excited me, however, was the director. E. Niwas who had directed the flawless Shool a year and half ago was also directing this film. I immediately rented this one out with high expectations. And, to say the least, I&apos;m not really disappointed, though it could&apos;ve been better. Story: Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega sums up the entire story line. Starting out with hilarious narration by Paresh Rawal, we learn the problems of the main protaginists and their stories. Sapna (Sonali Bendre) is a really bad artist, but Prakash (Saif Ali Khan) has fallen in love with her for the money. They wed and Prakash gets everything he wants, except respect from his baoji (Dilip Tahil), Rajiv Kapoor, a wealthy industrialist. He plans a new website, but is unable to get funding from Rajiv. Meanwhile, Rahul (Fardeen Khan) is already in love with Anjali (Twinkle Khanna), but is unable to hold onto a steady job, and thus is unable to pay the rent for his apartment, owned by Anjali&apos;s Tamil-speaking father. Rahul lives with Harry (Aftab), a lazy man who wants to become rich without working. And so begins the story. Somehow, fate conspires and brings Rahul and Harry to Prakash, where Prakash devises a plan to get money. It involves kidnapping Sapna, and holding her ransom to get money from Rajiv. Each have their own uses for the money. Prakash to start a new business and earn respect. Rahul to get a job (one which requires a bribe) and to pay off the landlord. Harry to travel the world and pay off Aslam Bhai (Johnny Lever), the local chor, who wants to become an actor some day.\n\nThe story is quite interesting and compelling, but inside all the pretty wrappings, it comes down to a &quot;man wants to marry woman, but father disagrees&quot; story. Still, the story is pretty interesting and makes the movie fun to watch, with a bunch of twists thrown in for good measure. Rating: 7/10\n\nActing: LKLKBK comes out quite well in this department. With a multistarrer cast, one would expect it to excell, however. Twinkle Khanna is given almost nothing to do, other than look pretty. Sonali Bendre is ok, but all she does is whine and cry (and look pretty). Saif surprised me. I usually dislike his acting, but his comic timing in this movie was great. He was especially memorable in the scene where he tries to fake sadness and anguish. Fardeen Khan is pretty good, playing the part of a man in need of a job convincingly. Aftab, however, is the big surprise of the movie. After seeing him in Kasoor, I couldn&apos;t expect a good comic performance from him. How wrong I was. Aftab is extremely funny in this movie, with a more subtle humor than one would expect in a typical film. And Aftab along with Fardeen make an extremely funny team throughout the movie. Johnny Lever is also funny in his parts, especially his acting scenes and his meetings with Aaj Kapoor. Dilip is, of course, great as the objectional father, and is funny at times. Rating: 9/10\n\nDirection/Technical editing The direction is excellent, with scenes flowing extremely well. E. Niwas has proved his excellence as a solo director, ready to take on the previous greats of Bollywood. However, the editing is a little weak. Some of Johnny Lever&apos;s scenes are a tad longer than required, and other scenes are a tad short. Rating: 9/10\n\nSongs: If LKLKBK has a weak point, this is it. The songs, composed by Vishal Bhardwaj are boring, and most are worth skipping. The picturization for a few songs are good, but nothing new. The only song worth watching is Aslam Bhai, both for its picturization, and its fun lyrics. Rating: 5/10\n\nFavorite Scenes This movie has several great scenes, but three really stick out as the most hilarious: The Sonali kidnapping scene, the Saif crying scene, and the Aslam Bhai &quot;acting mechanics&quot; scene. Also, for some reason, the scenes where the landlord keeps switching between Hindi and Tamil (between Fardeen and his family) is fun to watch. Rating: 10/10\n\nDVD review This is where the film (not necessarily the movie) truly faultors. The DVD is pure BS. Sure, it has the standard Hindi movie features of song and chapter menus and subtitles, along with an extremely fun-loving &quot;Making of...&quot; feature, but Video Sound needs to learn how to make DVDs that people will enjoy. You see, the problem is that when you start the DVD up, you have to sit through ads. 10 minutes of ads! And, to make it worse, they&apos;re all the same. Half are ads for Tum Bin, and the other half for Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ka. They&apos;re not even midly entertaining to watch once, and watching them everytime you start the movie is absolutely rediculous. They&apos;re impossible to skip over, even after trying all possible tricks to get p a s s e d it. Thus, I can only recommend this DVD for a rent, and nothing close to a purchase (unless you have that much patience). Rating: 2/10\n\nOverall: This is a great movie to watch a few times. It&apos;s extremely funny with more intelligent humor than your average movie (similar to Hera Pheri in that aspect). Not a movie to be missed, but I would recommend leaving this in the store due to the horrendous DVD. Rating of movie (not an average): 8.3 Rating of movie with DVD (not an average): 7.1",

Evil sorcerer Kartan, however, wants both the dagger and the virgin for a sacrifice ceremony. Erkan and Stefan rely on their video game experience to defeat the dark forces. At a length of only 77 minutes, the movie doesn&apos;t slow down too often between the gags, so if you have got the appropriate sense of humor, you may find this quite enjoyable. Excellent: Corinna Harfouch as the teacher who breaks her own rules to solve problems without violence. On the other hand, the performance of Bettina Zimmermann is disappointing. One needs more than wildly rolling eyes to follow the footsteps of a Michelle Yeoh or Sandahl Bergman. The parody elements are reminding me of movies like Stephen Sommers&apos; &quot;The Mummy&quot;, Harold Ramis&apos; &quot;Bedazzled&quot; and J.

      "reviewBody": "&quot;La femme publique&quot; does not allow traces of subtlety. In fact, in fantasy or in the mixture between these two poles, everything is said or shown in excesses.\n\nTo the unsuspecting, it is the warning: the work of the Polish director Andrzej Å»uÅawski is neither rest nor invitation to the contemplative gaze, nor does it want to be analytical. It allows, however, many reflections and moments of pure poetry, but its main characteristic is the disturbing, provocative, rebellious and critical figure about life and consequently about man.\n\n&quot;La femme publique&quot; was made in 1984 with inspiration from the novel &quot;Demons&quot; by Dostoevsky. Scenes of this same healthy play used in a film that is being made within the film itself or what would be the main story &quot;La femme ...&quot; this use of metalanguage, which often complicates the understanding of the work, yields, in Counterpart, a valuable game that even equates the audience with the protagonist of the story, the dizzying Ethel (ValÃ©rie Kaprisky).\n\nShe equates in the sense that Ethel is a young aspiring actress who can not differentiate acting and reality, to the point of assuming the figure of a dead woman whose murderer is the abusive and displaced director Lucas Kesling (Francis Huster), add to this plot the A figure of Milan (Lambert Wilson), a Czech immigrant who is manipulated by the filmmaker (Lucas) to commit a political assassination. Among these three characters that form a love triangle that is never realized or wanted to be performed, we accompany the fears, insanities, challenges and impulses as archetypes of a fictional world mirrored to the real.\n\nAt various moments in the film, we feel as if we are as lost as Ethel, and as his character, there is no one who can give us hands, on the contrary, whenever someone arises we are attacked either verbally or physically, which establishes A very crazy game that makes us embarrassed, because when this game is fictional (that is being shot during the main movie) such aggressions are even well received, but when they reveal themselves in the reality of the lives of those actors, human beings, it is an aggression Even though there is a strong backing that we are watching a performance within the other, but again, as it is mirrored in real life, it is a madness and aggression common to human life.\n\nWhether it&apos;s a recording set, a movie day, or the end of the movie, where actors like a theater revere the public&apos;s applause. In all these moments that mix reality and fiction, the palette of tones used in &quot;La femme publique&quot; does not allow traces of subtlety. In fact, in fantasy or in the mixture between these two poles, everything is said or shown in excesses. Because the traits are so gross, the moments of failure and the uncertainty of which world we are, soften this drama. It is interesting to note the theatrical references that accompany the director Andrzej Å»uÅawsk, not only of theatrical authors, but in reference to theatricals like Brecht, with his political theater with ruptures and fragmentation of the scenes, besides the &quot;I&quot; narrator where the figure of the actor is Sometimes the intermediary of the author&apos;s ideas. Another theatrical reference is by Antonin Artaud is his theater of cruelty, where the actors look for in real situations and emotions to bring them and to revive them in the stage, like the young actress Ethel of the film, however, that is lost when mixing Reality and fiction.\n\nAlthough relatively narrow, ZuÅawski weaves his own tale of political violence with Dostoyevsky. Kesling explains that he wants to adapt the novel because it is &quot;a prophetic tale about those who try to change the world through violence,&quot; and strangely it becomes the incarnation of Stavrogin and Verkhovensky. ZuÅawski selects key scenes from &quot;Demons&quot; to include as the film within a movie and most of them have to do with political content. The scene at one of Verkhovensky&apos;s meetings is brilliantly filmed as a sweaty game on an indoor tennis court, where it is stated that &quot;murder, blackmail, extortion, bombs&quot; will be added to his agenda, and a list of people to be killed must Be drafted immediately.\n\nThe camera in the films of Å»uÅawski is chained in scenes, advancing in the arrows and actively seeking the actors, most scenes of &quot;Femme Publique&quot; is struck by low and daring angles that make Kaprisky a species of totemic goddess or a lost soul in means To vertiginous and cavernous European buildings, spiral staircases and dilapidated columns. But this is also his most sumptuous film in terms of lighting, courtesy of the celebrated director of photography Sacha Vierny.\n\nNo longer the acting of the actors is the height of the film, but ValÃ©rie Kaprisky with its Ethel dominate the scene. If at the beginning of the film we have the young actress with lots of magazines of famous actors, the same happens with the consecration, even if fantastical of Ethel, stamping another pile of magazines, becoming the actress and woman publishes. Ethel&apos;s eroticism, through her body, her dance and her beauty, which is eternalized in this film and will surely be in the public&apos;s memory for a long time.",

Robbins Barstow&apos;s narration (from 1995) is better than competent and he handles the camera much more skillfully than your average amateur. The best thing about the home movie is the view we have of mid-1950s America: the clothing and customs, pre-jet airline travel, side trips to Universal Studios, Santa Catalina Island, Hollywood Boulevard, and Knott&apos;s Berry Farm in Buena Park. Living in Orange County, I have been to Disneyland countless times in the last 55 years and it is a thrill to see what it looked like a couple of years before my first visit.",

The adults and 12 year old were bored; the two youngsters were thrilled! Hence the score of 6.\n\nOverall, this was a harmless movie featuring a few humans and many trained dogs. It was sugary and nice - there was no real threat anywhere in the film of something bad happening (thus it is kid-safe for very young kids). And they&apos;ve reduced the idea of foster homes down to a concocted McNugget of a concept. My younger kids didn&apos;t even follow that theme at all.\n\nWhat they did follow, and what I found most redeeming, were the numerous cutesy dog tricks and toys. The creators of the film did a nice job inventing clever ways to mechanize the caring for dogs (think the breakfast scene in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang). That was fun. And the dogs were cute.\n\nFor me the drawbacks were these: Slow start, unfunny &apos;comic&apos; characters - like the foster parents and dog catchers, and a lame plot.\n\nBut ultimately - we had a nice outing, and you will too. And you will emerge from the film MORE likely to go get a dog of your own.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;That Darn Cat&quot; is a makeover of the Disney film with Haley Mills. This time around, the world is darker, the main character is darker...and the cat is darker.\n\nChristina (&quot;Addams Family,&quot; &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;) Ricci is the main character for our story. She&apos;s a psychopathic, Gothic creature with black all around. She moves to a new town, finds a new cat, finds a new mystery, and solves it (I wasn&apos;t expecting that). Along the way is Thomas F. Wilson, better known as Biff from &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; and Michael McKean--who does a bunch of nothing considering how funny the guy usually is.\n\n&quot;That Darn Cat&quot; fails on a lot of levels. It&apos;s watchable, and probably should be seen once on TV, but I wouldn&apos;t go out of your way to see it.\n\nChristina Ricci is fine as the title character; but I found that the whole moody, Gothic thing was a bit overdone--whether it was on the script like that or not, it was overbearing. They kept stressing to the audience, &quot;This girl is dark,&quot; but I think I got it the first time.\n\nDean Jones, from the original &quot;That Darn Cat,&quot; makes a few cameos in this flick. Whatever happened to him? The last I remember him in a film without being a cameo was &quot;Beethoven&quot;...\n\nThomas F. Wilson does seem to prove he can act out characters other than Biff, Griff and Buford Tannen, but if I were him I wouldn&apos;t quit the day job just yet--a film like this isn&apos;t going to get him back in the acting arena.\n\nThe film&apos;s gags don&apos;t exactly work all the time. Sometimes they work a little bit, but on the whole, this film is a pretty big mess that should only be seen on television when nothing good is on. \n\n2/5 stars -\n\nJohn Ulmer\n\nP.S.--Be on the lookout for cameos galore, including &quot;Cheers&quot; man John Ratzenburger.",

It&apos;s a simple story easy to understand and easy to watch The fighting is good although more could have been shown but what was shown was very enjoyable. Big Angelo is a champ no matter who he is up against he will accept the challenge! scorpion is awesome! Reviews i have read have been harsh as far as i&apos;m concerned for a lower budget film it really is superb! I would recommend this as A Must watch if you enjoy fighting films.",

      "reviewBody": "One night a New York City cop on the beat (Joe Bologna) goes into a liquor store and holds it up just to see if he could get away with it, and he does. The next day while caught in a traffic jam at the Long Island Expressway/Cross Island Parkway interchange, he brags to his partner (Cliff Gorman) about it, and from that point on, it&apos;s all about the money for the two of them. All to the cool mellow &apos;70&apos;s soundtrack by Michael LeGrande, Jacques Wilson and Candy Tate.\n\nUsing a cops standard salary, and the economy as an excuse to justify it, they decide that if they&apos;re going to end their crime spree, they should make a hit so big, they won&apos;t have to rob anyone anymore. But the question is who? And the answer comes in the form of a round-up of some mobsters from New Jersey lead by crime family boss Pasquale Aniello (John P. Ryan). After they make bail, the two cops decide to approach the boss under the guise of an offer to pull a job for them. As it turns out, the mob wants to get them to rob some bearer bonds from a financial firm on Wall Street during a parade for the Apollo 11 Astronauts, then make an exchange with the mobsters in Central Park. The firm they rob cooperates with them, but as it turns out, they&apos;re not entirely so squeaky clean either.\n\nThis movie was released in 1973, but was shot in 1972 and evidently takes place in 1969. This skewed time-line seems to be the biggest flaw on the movie, not to mention a 1972 Plymouth Fury NYPD Special suddenly becoming another car a couple of times. The familiar landscape to those of us from the New York Tri-State area especially during that era, makes it worth seeing. I actually remember catching the end of this on some weekend afternoon on WNEW Channel 5 during the scene where Joe Bolonga and Cliff Gorman are hassled by a bunch of bicyclists in Central Park and Joe throws a middle finger at them... UNCENSORED!! This was from back in the day when local TV stations existed and were willing to show obscure movies at odd hours. The movie has been on my mind from time to time ever since. I&apos;m glad I got myself a copy."

Great performances, great story. Very uplifting and emotional while touching on many societal issues. Refreshing to see there are still films out there that are grounded by real life tragedies that happen in our country every day and being brought to the attention of the people. I was very impressed at what what attempted and achieved with this movie. Didn&apos;t feel forced or self-indulgent. It really seemed like the film makers were truly trying to bring to light the stories of woman that go through situations similar to Apple&apos;s. And I also read somewhere that they had real women from shelters acting in the film. I personally just think that&apos;s so awesome to have people that have struggled in those circumstances be able to come in and help with the story being told. My hats off to the makers of Gimme Shelter. Definitely worth checking out",

After a few drinks one of them remembers an old game - Dead Mary - and the suspense begins.\n\nThis could have been a rather entertaining horror flick, but leaves you disappointed. The characters were okay and the story line had potential, but: no blood to talk about, no really scary scenes, no sitting on the edge of your seat and especially no Dead Mary! Trying hard to stay awake for an ending that could possibly have saved the movie from sucking totally turned out to have been in vain, &apos;cause the ending was the biggest disappointment of them all. Not only are you clueless of what it means, but also frustrated to bits &apos;cause you&apos;ve wasted almost one and a half hours on this crap! Considering myself to be quite a genre knower I believe this is one of the worst, or should I say BORING, horror flicks I&apos;ve seen. It didn&apos;t even make me laugh...",

Her character was great, especially with all the not so nice things she did and said, but then in the next sentence she would praise Jesus.  I also got a kick out of all the weird characters bubble boy meets on his trip to Niagra Falls.\n\n This movie was so much better than a lot of other comedies.  I guess all the controversy over the fact this movie makes fun of people who really live in bubbles is what killed it at the theater.  If I&apos;d known this was actually worth watching, I would have seen it a lot sooner.\n\n FINAL VERDICT:  Remember this is a comedy. Don&apos;t take it so seriously.  This movie is silly; it is not trying to be offensive.  Just take it for what it is worth and you will laugh and have a good time.  This is definitely worth the 90 minutes it takes to watch it."

The lighting in certain scenes particularly in the Aldini party is so poor that you wish that the film had made it to DVD so that we could witness a clearer picture. What saves the picture and makes it interesting is the storyline and the acting (even though McGoohan goes off the deep end, acting wise, towards the end of the film. Alexis Kanner is very good and gives a subtle yet strong performance and Patrick McGoohan cannot do better as the burned out, cynical radio talk show host. This film deserves a remake with todays story lines it would be a better film.",

This incident demonstrated for the first time that you could gain a world stage and the world&apos;s attention by committing an atrocity. The press has played a tacit role in terrorism since that time. Terrorists are looking for media coverage and know that the best way to get that is by executing attacks at prominent events or on large population centers.\n\nRe. the film, the fact that the German security forces were unprepared is no surprise as there was no precedent for this type of incident in the past. Sadly, many countries including most western countries are quite prepared now."

This documentary did a great job of exploring Luis Resto and while it set out to vindicate him it wound up making him more guilty for what transpired. While he was the one throwing the blows I think Panama Lewis and deceased Arty Curly where the real ones at fault here. I am not excusing Luis Resto in the least, but I think he was used and manipulated by others. While guilty I find him less so than the others and also a victim. This movie abounds with victims not the least of which was Billy Collins and his wife and daughter. His father was portrayed as something of a money grabber as well but I do not know if that is true. He lost not only his son, but one of his prized fighters. Highly entertianing, not for the faint of heart but I recommend it to any boxing fan especially anyone who remembers the fight and might not recall all of the sordid details of what took place.",

The production might not always be as well-made as in other movies, as well as the acting. Nonetheless the movies tell important lessons about friendship and the struggles of becoming a teenager. I want to show them to my kids later, as the movies are fun and there is still something to learn from them. Give them a chance.

Several favorite Blackmore&apos;s Night songs are done very well here: Soldier of Fortune, Ghost of Rose, Once in a Million Years. The arrangements and musicianship are very tight, with Richie Blackmore showing off his amazing skill with a variety of stringed instruments, and the other musicians playing a mix of period instruments (recorders esp.) and more modern ones (drums, keyboards) with great flair. Blackmore&apos;s wife Candice Night has a tremendous voice and sings the lead vocals beautifully, although her stage patter is a distraction. Talk about shut up and sing... \n\nThe setting is gorgeous: an authentic German castle town famous for its annual Medieval Fairs and many of the audience are in period costume as well, giving the whole concert an irresistible festival air. The camera keeps moving to highlight all of the performers, but the editing has a nice seamless look that calls little attention to itself. The concert makes for an enjoyable evening for anybody who likes this kind of music, and the disc is well produced and looks good.",

      "reviewBody": "The first thing you&apos;ll immediately notice about &quot;Hoboken Hollow&quot; (or at least I did) is the very, very extended cast list. The opening credits just don&apos;t stop introducing new names - among them a couple of very familiar ones like Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen - and you promptly realize what this movie will lack are one or two actual leading characters. &quot;Hoboken Hollow&quot; is based on true events that probably did involve a lot of people, but perhaps writer/director Glen Stephens should have just focused on the kidnapping and torturing of hitch-hikers and homeless people instead of also wanting to narrate a dozen of redundant sub plots. The tale of the so-called &quot;Texas Slave Ranch&quot; basically revolved on a family of deranged hicks forcing random travelers to labor on their ranch, but the screenplay finds it absolutely necessary to throw in story lines about real-estate issues, soldiers with post-Iraq traumas and demented family relations. It also never feels as if the movie is inspired by true events. It&apos;s your average modern &quot;torture-porn&quot; flick with a lot of disgusting scenery and villains with terrible dental hygiene, but there never is any atmosphere of suspense or genuine morbidity to detect. And, now that we&apos;re being completely blunt and honest, this film will probably not even satisfy the real gorehounds and sick puppies among us. There&apos;s a fair share of carnage and repulsiveness on display, but the sickness-factor never approaches that of other &quot;Torture Porn&quot; flicks like, say, &quot;Hostel&quot;, &quot;Saw&quot; or &quot;Wolf Creek&quot;. The rape sequence is quite unpleasant to behold (as rape sequences always are), but the actual torture footage is limited to shots of the victims getting poked with an electric shock device and getting dragged behind a car. Glen Stephens may perhaps be a little over-ambitious, but Â especially during a handful of isolated moments - his directing skills definitely show a lot of potential and he most certainly has a talented eye for appropriate casting. The aforementioned &quot;bigger&quot; stars Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen only appear in small roles, but some of the other villains are aptly cast like C. Thomas Howell as the nastily grinning Clayton and Mark Holton (who played the titular role in &quot;Gacy&quot;) as the slightly mentally unstable Weldon. Other remarkable B-movie names in the cast include Lin Shaye (&quot;2000 Maniacs&quot;), Robert Carradine, Dedee Pfeiffer and Randy Spelling. &quot;Hoboken Hollow&quot; is an overall weak and unsatisfying movie, but it&apos;s not entirely without interest for tolerant horror fanatics.",

And, in terms of the fantastic cinema of Japan, this is one of the more serious science fiction creations of the period, although containing many inaccuracies that would be glaring to anyone with the slightest familiarity to the work of George Pal. \n\nThis film features creative and interesting FX that vastly outshine most of what the US was producing at this time, and might even have the most complex miniature sets and sequences of anything produced by Toho during the classic period. There are large scale space ship dogfight sequences that anticipate Star Wars, which was done 17 years later. \n\nThe plot, while not profound, is sufficiently interesting and entertaining and the actors are good enough to make this an enjoyable escapist film. Thematically, this is classic Invasion Literature, with few new wrinkles thrown in...definitely straightforward, Honda doesn&apos;t give us anything ambiguous or subversive to chew over.\n\nAny fan of old-school scifi and Kaiju films is liable to enjoy this one very much, it&apos;s just an impressive spectacle.",

      "reviewBody": "Cannon Movie Tales are film adaptations of classic stories which were made in the late 1980s. Because the first, &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot; received mostly mediocre reviews (though it wasn&apos;t bad) the rest were never released theatrically, debuting on video instead. &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; is one of the lesser ones. It was directed by David Irving , who also directed &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot; and the worst one, &quot;The Emperor&apos;s New Clothes&quot;. The script meanders all over the place, introducing two &quot;Elves&quot;(who stop the story dead in it&apos;s tracks every time they appear) and a silly subplot involving the lack of available spindles which only serves to introduce a tacky and irrelevant &quot;production number&quot; which is, by far, the worst of all the songs. The acting, by Morgan Fairchild (the Queen) and Tahnee (daughter of Raquel) Welch, is bland to the point of somnambulence. Only Sylvia Miles, as the Evil Fairy makes much of an impression, and she has only a few scenes. Most of the singing voices are dubbed, including Fairchild and Welch, who can&apos;t possibly have had a worse singing voice than the off-key substitute (Linda Lopresti) used for her songs, (or CAN she?) The sets and costumes evoke the proper mood,which, unfortunately, the script and direction consistently undermine. Producer Menahem Golen reportedly loved fairy tales, so how could he let them get away with this? It is watchable, but what a disappointment.",

      "reviewBody": "Just like to respond to Howard Morley&apos;s comments. The dam&apos;s raids were urgently needed, and it took only a few months to form 617, train them and attack the dams. Quite a feat I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll agree. The film nicely conveys the struggles and the friendships of the crews, put together from the best of the Commonwealth fliers. Even if the screenplay does take some rather large liberties with the story.\n\nAs to Guy, he was killed in 1944 on his way back from acting as Master Bomber on a raid over Germany. His Mosquito crashed in Holland, killing him and his navigator. To this day there are no explanations for the crash. Guy should not have been flying at all, but he was so desperate to get back in the air that Bomber Harris gave in and let him. A tragedy. Of the crew of G-George (Guy&apos;s ship on the raid) none of them survived the war. The crew crashed whilst trying to bomb the Dortmund-Ems canal later in 1943.\n\nThe film is a fitting tribute to the raid, and the massive losses of 617. Of the 19 ships to go out, 11 came back. Of the 77 crew lost on the raid, only 1 survived. This is why the dams were not bombed again. And the problem with the Sorpe was that it was an earth damn, the bombs were not very effective as with the Eder and Moehne.\n\nHow do I know all this? My Great-grandmother was a Gibson.\n\nWatch the film and marvel."

Even though it has a PG 13 rating, it does not diminish the dark tone or seriousness of the movie. Captive State is a post alien invasion movie which deals with the aftermath of the aliens as an occupying force that infiltrated the government and controls society. This is a bleak setting with most of the populace living in poverty and squalor and is focused on the underground opposition trying to overthrow the occupying force. The acting is good with a lesser known cast with John Goodman as the lead. The special f/x are good, but this movie is more about the story and the characters fortunately. Captive State is based on The French Resistance in WW2, but the film brings this in a sci fi setting, with plot twists and a gritty style brings to mind lots of great classic dystopian science fiction and that is certainly not a bad thing in my book.",

The audience, which was rustling noisy junk food through the previews, fell silent very quickly.\n\nJackie Weaver as the Matriarch of this crime family was amazing.\n\nIt felt a little &quot;talkie&quot; until about half way through, but there is tension right from the beginning that carries you through. Every character is connected to every other as if by springs quivering with tension or compression and the movie really delivers holding the resolution to the final frame where everything shifts into a new alignment.\n\nI really enjoyed Animal Kingdom, it does not glamorize the life of these crims the way Underbelly or Sopranos does, and the cops reflect the dirty history of the Melbourne&apos;s finest too (Guy Pearce reprising his role in LA Confidential as a rare Mr Clean). Overall I think David Simon (The Wire) would approve of Animal Kingdom.\n\nAnyone who has wondered how murderers can be loved by their Moms (isn&apos;t that most everyone?) should see this movie, it isn&apos;t a TV experience it really works well on the big screen.",

(fill-in-the-blank: cellphones, video games, electricity, automobiles, aeroplanes, etc., etc.)\n\nThe thing we all know is, that not having these things, one can&apos;t&apos; miss not having them.\n\nI grew up in the late 60&apos;s, early 70&apos;s (shh!), and I thought we were the coolest, most &apos;futuristic&apos; we would ever be.\n\nSaturday mornings for me involved grabbing a bowl of cereal (they were all named &apos;sugar&apos; - something, i.e., Smacks, Pops, etc., and whilst the recipes for those cereals haven&apos;t changed, they removed the &apos;sugar&apos; from the name - but not the product) and plonking down to watch the fantastic shows of Gerry &amp; Sylvia Anderson, in particular, Thunderbirds, and l8r, Captain Scarlett.\n\nPeople writing reviews here now are constantly mentioning the effects,, good, bad, etc., but, the thing is, I know when I was a kid - and I was a damn smart kid - I didn&apos;t even think about the quality of the effects, I just thought the shows, the adventures were cool.\n\nAs most &apos;Fandersons&apos; know, there were 2 Thunderbird movies made - this one, and Thunderbirds are Go!\n\nI 1st saw this film in the late 70&apos;s, when I was a late teen, and I watched it because I wanted to reconnect with my childhood.\n\nI was riveted.\n\nI&apos;m now in my early adult years (A-HEM!), and I just watched - for the 1st time since the late 70&apos;s - Thunderbird 6, and I had a blast with my heroes of my youth.\n\nLike many of you, I am in awe of the hard work and craftsmanship which went into building the intricate models and then filming them, and not because I want to &apos;shatter the illusion,&apos; but, rather, because I am just amazed at this talent - I try to spot those shots where live action and model work are intercut, as well, and there are quite a few where I am left scratching my head; &apos;was that a model, or was it live?&apos;\n\nIncredible.\n\nThe gang - the Tracy Clan, (plus Brains &amp; Tin-Tin), as well as the glamorous Lady Penelope and Parker are all here for what amounts to a 90 minute long Thunderbird episode, but, it never feels padded, and unlike many movies &apos;costing many, many times the budget of this, you actually see where the budget was spent.\n\nAs the saying goes, &apos;no expense was spared,&apos; and it wasn&apos;t.&apos;\n\nThe sets, the special effects - you see where the money for this love letter to the kids (now adults) and their kids, and theirÂ, well, it&apos;s a love letter to us from the fabulous Anderson&apos;s.\n\nI did hear though, that Lady Penelope was supposedly &apos;difficult&apos; to work with on the set, but, in truth, it was she wanted to make sure her 6-wheeled Rolls was fine-tuned, and, I guess Gerry &amp; Sylvia had to pitch in, since &apos;Lady P&apos; is such an important part of Thunderbird lore.\n\nFor all those of us who never fully grew up, Thunderbird 6 is a lot of fun, and I think it&apos;s something I&apos;d share with any kid today, as times may change, we still love to explore with our minds, and the sky IS the limit with the Anderson&apos;s,.\n\nThunderbird 6 are GO!"

There is a disclaimer, in fine print, that the DVD will only play on DVD &quot;Play only&quot; devices, and may not play on your PC. WD cheaped out on this product. The story is filled with fine foods, kitchen antics, and rapid fire funnies. It was filmed on location all over Europe. The grizzly murders,are shocking. The many characters are played broadly, but then this a comedy. Well worth your time.",

      "name": "A delightfully fun little movie",
      "reviewBody": "This was notably the directorial debut for filmmaker Norman England, who has otherwise seemingly spent a lot of time in the industry in one capacity or another. Just as the modest production values and practical effects betray the low budget, the post-production effects also indicate the comparatively scarce resources, and are furthermore easily dated to the 2000s. Please note that none of this is specifically a mark against the movie - I find it irksome that &quot;low-budget&quot; is commonly held to mean something is inherently bad. Practical effects will always be preferable to digital wizardry, and those here look just swell in my book; where digital wizardry is less than perfectly seamless, whatever the reason, that&apos;s not inherently bad, either, and sometimes it&apos;s quite fitting for a piece. These are worthwhile observations to make, I think, just as other facets (like the soundtrack) further date the flick, and still it&apos;s all just part and parcel of a silly, fun-loving romp that&apos;s just here for a good time. And you know what? I think &apos;The idol&apos; is excellent!\n\nClocking in at under one hour, England and Kaneko Jiro&apos;s story is fairly simple as a toy figure of extraterrestrial origin finds its way to Earth and into the life of nerdy collector Ken, and strange things begin to happen. Most every element of the production similarly shows its age and limited financial backing, or possibly the relative inexperience of those contributing. Yet whatever reflections we might make about the look and feel, the fact is that this little feature is quite well done exactly as it is, and moreover, it&apos;s utterly delightful! The cast is unfailingly charming and ably meets the needs of the tiny tale, with special commendations for primary star Sasaki Jin, and Hayase Erina. (Do also note a small appearance by effects maestro Yamazaki Takashi.) I actually very much admire England&apos;s direction, and Takaoka Hiroo&apos;s cinematography; some small moments are unexpectedly smart. Likewise, the screenplay is kind of brilliant, with some wonderfully clever ideas in the narrative and scene writing, and some meaningful themes woven in. &apos;The idol&apos; may be a low-grade picture of no particular renown, and it would be easy to pass it by, but that would be a mistake in my opinion.\n\nI can see the love and hard work that was poured into these fifty-three minutes, not to mention the skill and intelligence, and for as splendidly entertaining as it is, there is also a welcome earnestness underlying the outward ridiculousness. Scrutinizing the more fantastical visuals is beside the point when they look as good as they do: while the bulk of the title is very down to Earth, with lovely work from all to bolster the verisimilitude, where the props, costume design, sound effects, tangible creations, production design and art direction, and even computer-generated imagery are sparingly employed to more whimsical ends (chiefly at, well, the end), I for one think the result looks terrific. The rock and pop may be easily dated but the tunes are still catchy, and I like Otani Kow&apos;s complementary score. Really, from top to bottom the film may not look like much, but the heart and sincerity is undeniable, and I fully recognize the love and care that went into it to make it both highly enjoyable and softly substantive. What more could we ask for?\n\nDon&apos;t let the unassuming appearance put you off. This is a really good time, with fine work from all involved to bring it to life, and as far as I&apos;m concerned it is a tremendous success. Diminutive in size and scope, the result is actually a blast to a degree that no few bigger and longer movies can only wish they could achieve. I find &apos;The idol&apos; to be an unlikely gem of a mini sci-fi comedy, and I&apos;m happy to give it my high and hearty recommendation!",

At this school all the little students wear uniforms that make them look like miniature Austin Powers&apos;. They also accompany the soundtrack with insipid songs that tell you what you are looking at. Whether you understand Italian or not, it soon gets on your nerves. \n\nThe couple decide to visit a Swiss sexuologist who uses a gay translator as a go-between. Paolo (Manfredi) does not seem to be having any problems down below, so it must be Maria (Melato)&apos;s fault. He buys a special bed, she tries to commit suicide. Maria prefers old wife&apos;s tales over cold scientific facts, making her imagine a pregnancy that is not really there. It takes her a long time to tell Paolo the truth. Too long in fact (for him and for the viewer), since they are already throwing baby showers and decorating a room for little &quot;Andrea&quot;.\n\nI suppose actress Mariangela Melato was more popular with women than with men, as she got to play more female friendly parts than her contemporaries. Instead of having to spend the whole film being just a love interest or a object of lust, this large eyed, slender woman actually got to put forth a feminist standpoint (occasionally). There is also some typical early seventies social commentary on pollution, and Nino Manfredi shows he plays a nice guy really well. Still, neither the characters nor the viewer get a satisfactory feeling of closure. Like the similarly themed &apos;Maybe Baby&apos; (2000), the movie simply ends.\n\n5 out of 10"

I also have to admit, I did not know Lucio Fulci did sequels ... that also surprises me a little bit. But then again I am not a scholar of his, so ... if you are and this offends you, it is not meant to and I apologize.\n\nAway from what we know or didn&apos;t, the movie is quite the adventure, with the dog being in the middle of it. Most of the time quite literally. I love how he is being used ... or rather how he drives the story. Animal lovers rejoice ... somewhat. Well made thriller with a lot of humor in it.",

It&apos;s touching, sad, and frustrating to watch as Walt keeps throwing himself at Johnny, and is constantly rebuffed. Walt, who is the caregiver to just about everyone he meets, spouts life philosophy and seems to enjoy the thrill of the chase in the gritty side of town. At the same time, it&apos;s refreshing to see a film from 20 years ago treat gay characters and relationships with respect, and to give them &quot;normal&quot; lines without resorting to stereotypes. Oddly, Ray Monge, who plays Roberto, a friend of Johnny, is the only one has has had more than one or two roles listed in their career, and he has just four roles listed. Some neat little touches, like the bottle on a string that pulls the door closed like a spring, Walt greeting everyone on the street, and the driving lesson gone wrong. Interesting interview with van Sant on the DVD from janus/Criterion, where he explains how it was made from Curtis&apos; story. A little offbeat and rough, but fun to watch.",

It&apos;s a fevered performance on which the whole film rests. Easily worth a watch.\n\nBut it also demands a lot from the audience. For one, there&apos;s an undercurrent of dread that&apos;s there right from the start and it&apos;s hard to watch Ford&apos;s mercurial character drag his family to the far ends of the jungle essentially to reboot civilization (a myopic one, at that). All I could think of was my family in that situation (hell, no).\n\nI&apos;m not going to lie, this is a hard movie, rife with misfortune; on occasions shocking, infuriating and exhausting. But I was glued to my seat until the very end, primarily because of Ford&apos;s deteriorating mental state. That&apos;s a house of horrors unto itself. This is a well-directed movie but man if it&apos;s not wearing.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is a perfect example of the great comedy art of TotÃ². As always the story offers opportunities for the brilliant improvisations of the great comedian. As always, it is very difficult for those who don&apos;t speak the language to seize all the nuances and subtleties in the dialogues. The story, however, is quite original in itself: it is all about a couple of unwary thieves who go on from one theft to another, until one of them finds -within the swag- a letter of appointment -from a local politician to one of his countryman- that recommends the Turk himself (the victim of their theft) for a job at a wealthy trader&apos;s shop. The story unfolds between misunderstandings of all kinds and is based on the unawareness of Toto&apos;s character that the letter assignment tacitly assumes that the bearer is supposed to be an eunuch ... Dialogues at this point become kind of pyrotechnic, and the comedian is triggered in a series of puns and jokes that can bring down the ceiling. In the end, the deceit will come to light, but the devilish petty thief will find once again the way of breaking the rules by turning the situation to his advantage and of solving all the intrigues that threatened the happiness of the other characters. Among the pretty actresses in this movie we can admire the late wife of TotÃ²&apos;s, Franca Faldini; there&apos;re also the right-hand men Carlo Campanini, the unfailing Mario Castellani, and -as a real treat- a very young Aldo GiuffrÃ¨, who will be -later on- impersonating the famous Alcoholic Union Captain of the unforgettable &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;. Altogether one of my favorite films of the period of TotÃ²&apos;s artistic maturity, though still soaked in a fair dose of naivety, which leaves a pleasing aftertaste of old times in your mouth. In one of the scenes, when the eunuch is attending the women on the &quot;forbidden-to-men&quot; side of the beach, and he&apos;s telling his adventures in exotic lands, the women ask him how many wives do they have over there. He answers of course they have many ... up to 50 and more! ... Wow, go the ladies ... But you have to reckon - he continues - that it implies also 49 mothers-in-law ... Why only 49? ... asks one of them, a young woman ... Well, you see ... averaging, you certainly will find at least one orphan among 50 ladies ... These were the kind of unearthly things TotÃ² could conjure up, out of his magician&apos;s hat: 1953! Can you recall what other comedians around the world were proposing in those days? ... Bye, Pino.",

Whichever and whatever it is, it recounts a lecture tour/poetry reading tour by Georgian nationalist poet Akaki Tsereteli (1840-1915). He was prominent enough in Georgia to be known just by his first name, and he was called &quot;King of the Georgian Poets&quot; by his admirers.\n\nNot much of this movie survives; estimates are that a third of it has been recovered and restored. So we get one or two close-ups of the man, a medium shot of children dancing around him, and then a lot of long shots of touristy things seen long the route, like unusual rock formations and 11th Century churches.\n\nDirector/cinematographer Vasil Amashukeli does several pans for the scenic stuff. They are slow and jerky, as if he was dealing with a very heavy camera and no tripod. Or the effect may be due to the very fragmentary nature of what has survived and its restoration.",

      "reviewBody": "THREE WORLDS is a stunningly dramatic film directed by Catherine Corsini who co-wrote the story and screenplay with BenoÃ®t Graffin in collaboration with Antoine Jaccoud and Lise Macheboeuf - a film that approaches several poignant subjects that all weave together to make this a study in human responsibility from birth to death. The acting is extraordinary, the pacing exactly on mark, the cinematography by Claire Mathon enhances the themes, the subtle musical score by GrÃ©goire Hetzel underlines the tension, and the lessons it presents and drives home make is one of the more important social statements before the public today. And additional credit should be given to Film Movement for bringing it to our attention.\n\nAl (the very fine RaphaÃ«l Personnaz) is an attractive young man who has risen from the lower stratum of French society to become the co-owner of an automobile firm owned by the shifty but wealthy Testard (Jean-Pierre Malo) and is due to be married to the Testard&apos;s daughter Marion (AdÃ¨le Haenel) in 10 days. Out celebrating one evening with his friends and fellow workers Franck (Reda Kateb) and Martin (Alban Aumard) Al is the perpetrator of a hit and run accident, critically injuring a Moldavian pedestrian, a scene that is witnessed by the pregnant Juliette (Clotilde Hesme), a woman struggling with her own problems of relationship with the baby&apos;s philosophy professor father FrÃ©dÃ©ric (Laurent Capelluto) who calls 911 to the scene. Al is terrified of his actions, but is convinced by his friends to ignore the situation: after all, the victim is merely an illegal immigrant. Juliette is wrought with empathy, discovers the victim&apos;s name, meets the victim&apos;s wife Vera (Arta Dobroshi) and the two women bond. Al is so disturbed by his action that he visits the hospital where the victim is in ICU and is seen by Juliette who then sets about to find Al to ask him to do the right thing - turn himself in to the police or at least give money to Vera who is without funds to pay for her husband&apos;s care. The plot becomes more complex as Al and Juliette are drawn together - Juliette is the only person with whom he can share and admit his guilt. Juliette is then placed in a position of intermediary between the critically wounded husband of Vera, Vera&apos;s Moldavian &apos;family&apos; and Al. How the situation resolves - including the consequences of Al&apos;s moves with his boss and his finance and his encounters with Vera and her &apos;family&apos; and the death of Vera&apos;s husband forms the closure of this powerful film.\n\nThere is a scene in a classroom where Juliette&apos;s husband is teaching philosophy that quotes Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher known for his existential and phenomenological explorations of the &quot;question of Being&quot; who FrÃ©dÃ©ric quotes as saying &apos;the only thing we truly own is our death&apos;. It is a poignant moment that allows the rest of the film&apos;s themes to gel. This is a superb film worthy of wide attention. \n\nGrady Harp",

Michael Moore for example. Sometimes they are SO much better. this film, directed by Don Boyd and produced by Charles Sturridge and Nick Fraser, is an example of documentary at its very best. a combination of innovative smooth film-making (albeit impressionistic at times) and very sensitive, probing storytelling. It looked ravishing and was brilliantly edited.(Kate Spankie) it worked on so many levels and i enjoyed every moment. (a bit short maybe - apparently Don Boyd shot 100 hours of footage!). i saw it on a big screen in Brussells with many other women. They loved it.",

Director Kathryn Bigelow has followed the hunt from 9-11 to the tension filled raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The movie is based on the true events. There is a relevant question of how true to the events is the movie. Unlike most movies, this is actually an important question.\n\nMost of us have no hope of knowing the true facts that actually happened. This movie is certainly a possible reality. Some of it is probably wrong. They&apos;ve probably changed some of it to not reveal CIA trade craft. Others looks different than what&apos;s been reported on the news. However it is overall following the story already laid out for the public.\n\nThe hunt for Bin Laden can meander and not follow a straight line. It doesn&apos;t really built like a normal movie. Bigelow is still able to maintain the tension throughout the movie. The last 40 minutes is where this movie truly excels. The raid in Abbottabad is incredibly tense. The Hollywood flashiness is mostly removed. It takes its time. It&apos;s done almost in real time. It has the intensity of realism. It&apos;s shocking how real the raid looked.",

The movie has good twists and action, I really loved the acting from Jasom Statham who is a really good actor! If you are an action movies fan then you shouldn&apos;t miss this movie... and don&apos;t think this movie is an all action movie, the story is well written and the twists are well made. I&apos;d say go for it if you don&apos;t know which movie to watch!\n\nThe movie starts with Jason Statham out of the force. So then they had to get him back because of a bank robbery and the bad guys asked for him. Something bad happens in the Bank, then the cops are after the bad guys looking for them. You will have to keep a close eye at the movie, it&apos;s a good action thriller that you will not expect to be as good as it is!! and after this movie i&apos;ll proudly say i&apos;m a huge fan of Jason Statham (Snatch, Lock Stock and two Smoking Barrels, Transporter, Transporter 2, Cellular, CHAOS), this guy is just amazing!",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, a piece of literature written by William Golding and originally published in 1954, is still a very famous novel, and is often studied in schools (many can say that&apos;s where they became familiar with it). Nearly a decade later, the first movie adaptation of the book saw the light of day. Adaptations of novels can be excellent, while others may generally be disappointing. This 1963 adaptation of William Golding&apos;s famous novel turned out to be sort of a mixed blessing.\n\nA large group of English schoolboys find themselves stranded after a plane crash, without any surviving adults. Shortly after the crash, two of them meet for the first time. One of them is Ralph, and the other&apos;s real name remains unknown. The other boy tells Ralph about his undesired nickname, Piggy, and unfortunately, that is what he is called from then on. Ralph and Piggy don&apos;t see any other boys around, so Ralph uses a shell (or a conch) to call them. With all the boys gathered, Ralph is elected as the leader for the time they are stranded, and it is soon discovered that they are on an island. Ralph tries his best to keep the rest of the boys civilized, and tells them that a smoke signal must be kept going in order for them to be rescued. However, a rivalry soon begins between Ralph and the power-hungry Jack, and many boys end up on Jack&apos;s side, creating a group of savages! \n\nThe first thing you may be wondering about this movie is how faithful to the novel it is. Quite a bit of detail from the story was removed for this movie (which often happens with adaptations of novels), so if you&apos;ve read the book, remembering some parts that you found really interesting, and you&apos;d like to see how they&apos;re done in this movie, you may be disappointed to see that some of them are not included. However, apart from that, I would say the movie tells the original story very well, but it definitely has some other problems. The cinematography is pretty amateurish, and the cast is, well, not terrible, but not great. Personally, I found some of the movie dull, so I had trouble getting into it at times, but also found certain parts interesting or somewhat moving (though not as much so as I was expecting).\n\nThis &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; adaptation definitely hasn&apos;t impressed every admirer of the book, which I can understand. I was a tad disappointed myself (certainly not as much as some people, but still a tad disappointed). However, many other admirers of William Golding&apos;s piece of literature like this movie. For fans of the book who haven&apos;t seen this movie, if you want an adaptation that is faithful to the book (despite the unsurprising fact that the story is shortened), and you can get over the shortcomings I&apos;ve mentioned, I recommend this movie. You just might not want to expect a work of genius.",

The lighting, or lack thereof, is an appropriate starting point I suppose.  You can&apos;t see anything that&apos;s going on in this flick.  It&apos;s awful.  The lighting guy (assuming there was one) should be shot.  Next stop: inane dialogue.  What in the hell was up with the brainless dialogue and the delivery of said brainless dialogue?  It&apos;s pathetic at best.  And the music...nevermind. Just stay away from this one.  I am now dumber after witnessing the dreaded terror of the Alien Dead."

The noise that the little girl&apos;s doll made was silly and funny, but overall the gore, the plot, and the scenery (of the haunted house especially) was just breathtaking. The movie may be a little boring to you at times but not a whole lot.  The movie does look like it has a cheap setting because it is a foreign film, but it is a must-see and it is better than most american made gory films. My rating is 8.5 out of 10 stars."

      "reviewBody": "Disney today has gone through multiple changes throughout its history. There&apos;s the classical period, the slump period, the renaissance period and the rise to super studio power in the late 2000s. However even during the 1990s when Disney was breaking records in its animated films, they also were breaking records in flops in another type of film. Those films were in live-action, many of which were derived from cartoons from decades before. For those cases, Disney had made some pretty bad films. Mr. Magoo (1997), George of the Jungle (1997) and Inspector Gadget (1999) being relatively the last bunch of theatrical releases to be made, for the most part signaled the end of such cartoon live-action adaptations. But even for Disney, nothing would stop the studio giant from making a little extra cash even after that. Some years later, Disney would release sequels to some of these movies and for the poorly adapted Inspector Gadget (1999), he too got his own. The question is, is it worth a watch?\n\nEhhh,...in some respects yes because there seems to be improvement. Then again, there really was no need to begin with because a sequel will not make up for the mistakes of the first. With a script written by the director Alex Zamm (Chairman of the Board (1998), Tooth Fairy 2 (2012) and Jingle All the Way 2 (2014)) and two other writers, the adaptation part of the film is more faithful to that of the original cartoon. And for some viewers, that may be all they need because the entirety of the movie does feel more cartoonish than that of the first movie. When Dr. Claw (Tony Martin) escapes from prison, it&apos;s up to Inspector Gadget (French Stewart), his niece Penny (Caitlin Wachs) and newly activated member G2 (Elaine Hendrix) to bring the evil mastermind to justice. The idea is as routine as ever but it again sticks to the formula that made the cartoon what it was. Also what makes this film more faithful than the one before is that most of Dr. Claw&apos;s face is kept concealed from the audience. It was a big gripe people had with the 1999 film.\n\nAs stated in the plot prior, much of the cast from the first film have been replaced or rewritten out. The only actor who didn&apos;t get replaced was D.L. Hughley as the Gadget Mobile; because people loved him the most? Also there&apos;s no mention of whatever happened to Joely Fisher&apos;s role as Brenda who played Gadget&apos;s love interest in the first movie. French Stuart as Gadget looks more like his cartoon counterpart than Matthew Broderick. Caitlin Wachs taking over Michelle Trachtenberg&apos;s role performed okay but nothing special. As for Claw, Tony Martin&apos;s portrayal Vs Rupert Everett is not hilariously funny but it&apos;s alright. Elaine Hendrix as G2 was okay even though her role was very contrived. It&apos;s pretty obvious what she serves as to Gadget. If there&apos;s one thing that stays true through this film is that almost every actor chews up the scenery around them. Almost every scene is super hammy. It&apos;s not bad occasionally or maybe for one character but even the less important characters are biting at the corners of every frame.\n\nWith that being said, the comedy isn&apos;t that funny either. Thankfully, Disney toned down the inappropriate humor from the first film but didn&apos;t bother fix anything else. The one liners are formulaic and predictable but they do at least sound more believable being delivered from Stewart than Broderick. Dr. Claw also has a bunch of stock henchman that do act like the cartoon but here just feel silly. Of all things, why would Dr. Claw hire a single ninja? Also sometimes the dialog doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense due to certain characters having knowledge that goes unexplained. How would one specific character know how a mechanical device works if the villain didn&apos;t even give the obligatory exposition to them? The stretch of the imagination only goes so far. Seeing Dr. Claw make a weapon out of 3 or 4 non-connective items is one thing, but knowing how it works without even being told? Yeah,...not buying it.\n\nEven with this mediocre writing, there is still some visual integrity. The special effects to this entry are adequate for its budget even though they are not as polished as the first film. However considering it was 12 million Vs 75 million (estimated), that&apos;s not entirely bad. There are places where it&apos;s noticeably fake though. The cinematography shot by Geoffrey Wharton who is usually just a camera operator does okay here. There&apos;s no strange angles or up close facial zoom-ins so that&apos;s praiseworthy. Anything else though is just standard shooting. The musical score composed by Chris Hajian is okay too. Even though the sound is not as bombastic as John Debney&apos;s version of the first one, Hajian retains the Inspector Gadget theme and does what he can to make it sound acceptable for a DVD sequel. The overall product is still messy but some may like it more than the original film.\n\nHaving its cast mainly replaced, the actors are a lot hammier, the comedy is still predictable and the effects do look somewhat cheaper. However some of the writing does follow the cartoon more this time than the first movie and although not everything makes sense it feels more like an extended cartoon episode. So that kind works in its favor.",

      "reviewBody": "On his first day at a new school, Cameron falls for Bianca Stratford. However not only is she popular and beautiful but her father has forbidden her to date until her older sister does too.  The problem is her sister, Kat, is negative, bad tempered and unfriendly and certainly undateable. Cameron seeks the services of school bad boy Pat who he arranges to be paid to date Kat and thus allow him to go out with Bianca - but things never go smoothly when it comes to love.\n\nI&apos;m not a big fan of teen comedies.  They mostly are lame, trading on the same old plots and clichÃ©s that have been around since Animal House and Porkies.  The recent trend has just seen classical texts adapted giving rise to some poor films like `She&apos;s all that&apos;.  The plot for this is basically `The Taming of the Shrew&apos; updated - most of it bares little resemblance to the play but that doesn&apos;t matter - the core is interesting enough to stand on it&apos;s own.  It may not surprise you in terms of who gets which girl and it&apos;s fairly predictable in a romantic comedy type way but that&apos;s not it.\n\nNo - the film is funny, lively and pretty enjoyable.  The comedy is built around the central plot with lots of nice touches and characters that are genuinely funny, such Mr Morgan and the erotic drama writing headmistress. The jokes happily never stoop to the gross-out type and this helps it feel fresh and lively, rather than just scrapping the bottom of the barrel.\n\nAnother strength is that the cast are all very likeable and give good performances all round.  Compared to the horror or Prince and Lillard in `She&apos;s all that&apos; this was a dream cast.  Ledger is a real up and comer and he does well here - he doesn&apos;t over-egg his bad boy cake and his fall into love is believable.  Stiles is very cool and better than the teen roles she has had of late.  Here she rises above the `outsider&apos; clichÃ© given to her and does good work - again being a likeable and believable character.. Gordon-Levitt is OK but quite characterless compared to the main two roles, likewise Oleynik.  The bets roles are those on the edges and the three adult support roles really do well and are very funny -  Janney, Mitchell and especially Miller on good form.  Gabrielle Union is once again given a side role that doesn&apos;t play to her strength.  I like her and want to see her in bigger roles but here she is a `minority face&apos; in a predominately white film, just as she was in She&apos;s All That - maybe I&apos;m being a little paranoid but that&apos;s what it feels like.\n\nOverall I was taken by surprise as to how funny and lively this film was. It didn&apos;t sink to the gross out comedy of so many teen movies and had characters and actors who brought spark and energy to the screen.  It may be predictable but it works and the jokes and side characters just add to the sense of fun.  Not brilliant but compared to the mediocre bunch of teen comedies you COULD watch, this is fantastic!"

      "reviewBody": "I am vividly aware, as are most avid moviegoers, of the horror movie machine. It churns out Final Destinations, exorcism films, and at an even higher frequency, ghost films. At first glance, The Woman in Black appears to be yet another of these &quot;ghost films,&quot; where cheap scares, predictable plot &quot;twists,&quot; and horrible acting drag the viewer down into an hour-and-a-half maelstrom of mediocrity that can only end at the appearance of &quot;Directed by...&quot; \n\nAccording to most of the reviewers thus far, The Woman in Black was a letdown. So perhaps it is because I went into the film with no expectations that I came out of it impressed and very, very shaken. I do not plan to explain the plot to you (many have done this already and there is a synopsis which does a far better job than I could), but I will argue in favor of how successfully scary this film was. Yes, it contains ghost film elements we have all seen before, but they are cleverly and patiently arranged so that the viewer becomes totally enveloped in atmospheric dread. Sure, there are &quot;jump&quot; scares, but these are also complimented by many shots which unfold slowly and effectively. It sometimes reminded me of the 1961 film, The Innocents, if that gives you a better idea. Radcliffe is also a worthy focal point of the film, keeping most of the fear and anticipation unspoken throughout.\n\nI would not nominate this film for any kind of award, but it achieves what I believe should be the ultimate goal of all &quot;horror&quot; movies: to draw us in so close that when our fear manifests itself on-screen, it is already too late to turn away. It rates high as one of my favorite horror theater experiences, alongside The Descent and The Strangers.",

      "reviewBody": "Those of us who have followed Frederico Fellini and leading man Marcello Mastroianni in many of those classics of World cinema, including 8 and a half, will be rather surprised and maybe shocked to see him starring in this scattergun crime thriller.\n\nDirected without much flair and featuring many quite loosely shot car chases and lively crime-sprees and shoot-outs, the cast to many of us Brits will be spearheaded by the relentless macho dominance of Oliver Reed. He&apos;s the brutal head kidnapper, jumping at the opportunity of the chance kidnapping of business head Mastroianni, who really only wants to rush off with his mistress for a weekend of hanky-panky (hence the title.)\n\nThe version on TCM (TV) was dubbed - and not too badly at that. I&apos;m sure Reed&apos;s voice is as was though but with an &apos;accent&apos; - how accurate it is and how insulting it would be to Europeans, I do not know. I&apos;m presuming that they had to dub him into Italian for its home release. \n\nThe film skips along briskly, featuring many of the things we associate with Italy, largely through aforementioned films by Fellini and the like. Namely, scavenging paparazzi in pursuit of story and scandal, jostling with the Police on the chase. The price of capitalism and trappings of wealth all questioned through the dialogue. The whole feel seems to be par of the course of its era for many adult crime thrillers, both from Hollywood and the UK. \n\nIt&apos;s the first time I&apos;d ever encountered the film, let alone on TV. The number of reviews and votes here on IMDb shows it&apos;s quite rare and it&apos;s unlikely I&apos;ll get to see it again. Not that I&apos;d particularly want to but am kind of glad I did.",

Talking about the actors: Although we have at least one great actor here, the overall performance is sometimes not really good. And by the way, any kind of nudity that might be or might not be in the movie, didn&apos;t make any difference in my rating/review. (a nod to a friend of mine, in case he&apos;s reading! ;o)\n\nBut apart from the (sometimes) overacting, the other two flaws are the (holes in the) script and the odd editing! So it&apos;s not too bad (there a few really good scares here), but overall it&apos;s not more than mediocre!",

The third film is a surprisingly fast-paced for most of the time, with plenty of black arts in practise with gory and gruelling results. We get to see maggot-infested bodies and food bowls, exploding spellcraft victims, hilarious and stupid dialogue (and dubbing) and exotic locations in the jungles of Indonesia (I think, since this was a co-production between a few Asian countries.) The film is made with an ultra-low budget but that&apos;s why it is also so enjoyable and smile-inducing, and the effects are certainly not as bad as they could be. I&apos;d like to see the two original Shaw films, but in itself, Queen of Black Magic is a welcome addition to the library of weird and wild cinema beyond any limitations or taboos.",

      "reviewBody": "In a post-apocalyptic future an outpost turn to a stranger to battle a motorcycle gang over a location where water, the most precious substance is located.\n\nDirected by Giuliano Carmineo Exterminators of the Year 3000 (Il Giustiziere della Strada) is no doubt a Mad Max 2 copy-cat, but is was certainly not first or last. Released in 1983 the same year as a flurry of others including Escape from the Bronx, The New Barbarians, Endgame, 2019: After the Fall of New York to name a few. While it suffers from the usual co-Italian production issues of the 80s, clunky dialogue, lapse in logic, choppy editing, dubbing and sound design, what it does have is great practical stunts and car chases accompanied by a catchy notable (of the time) soundtrack from Detto Mariano. Also Alejandro Ulloa&apos;s cinematography captures some interesting subterranean, flatlands and rugged terrain locations. Carmineo camera work has a flair and roughness that gives this offering charm along with the low budget constraints that forces him to be dangerously inventive during the action setups.\n\nThe cast do there best with Dardano Sacchetti, Elisa Briganti and JosÃ© Truchado&apos;s script. I&apos;ve never heard any one say &quot;mother-grabbers&quot; before. Robert Iannucci makes for a good lead as Alien. Alicia Moro is notable as Trash. Actor Fernando Bilbao as Crazy Bull does his best Vernon Wells&apos; Wez impression. Venantino Venantini&apos;s small role as John offers screen presence, with child actor Luca Venantini as Tommy (and his a little pet hamster) doing a good job.\n\nOverall, in filmmaking they say &apos;never work with children and animals&apos; - this has both. If you can swallow 1970s and 80&apos;s vehicles in a future set in year 3000 you&apos;re in for a good time."

This concentration camp survivor looking like individual goes by the name, no big surprise here, of Harry played by a emaciated looking skin and bones, a body that&apos;s perfect in escaping from straight-jackets and handcuffs, Adrien Brody.\n\nTogether with his partner in crime Greg &quot;Handsome&quot; Evens, Michael Henderson, Harry kidnaps both Frances Hannon, Laila Robins, and her pet Pooh,played by Duke the Dog, as she was out walking him outside her luxury apartment house one afternoon in Midtown Manhattan. Held for one million dollars in ransom money Harry demands from Frances&apos; millionaire art collector husband Clark, James Naughton, that if he doesn&apos;t get the cash by 6:00 Am the next morning she&apos;ll be dead; Dying from suffocation by being buried alive in some unknown location outside the city limits.\n\nThe movie starts to get really strange when NYPD lady Det. Madeline &quot;Maddy&quot; Foster, Maura Tierney, is put on the case. With the police and Det. Foster casing out the money drop at the Queens Cemetery, where Harry Houdini just happens to be buried, Harry-the Psycho-leaves himself wide open to be captured by walking right into the trap that the police set for him. After a French Connection style car case thorough the city Harry is finally captured and put into police custody. It&apos;s then when we finally realize what exactly Harry&apos;s motives in kidnapping Frances, and her pet pooch, really were! They turned out to be just as crazy and unpredictable as he is!\n\nWe also get to see Det. Foster&apos;s dark and secret life as a S&amp;M freak that she&apos;s been keeping from her boss in the NYPD as well as husband Capt. Tim Foster, Terry Kinney. This strange and destructive lifestyle is quickly picked up by, who&apos;s very obviously into S&amp;M himself, Det. Foster&apos;s captive Harry! With that knowledge in mind Harry does everything he can to get under Det. Foster&apos;s skin making her job, in finding the buried alive France&apos;s Hannon and her Pooch, much harder then it already is.\n\n***SPOILER ALERT*** We soon get to find out just that the not all there upstairs Harry really wanted to get himself caught in order to prove that he, like his hero Harry Houdini, can escape from any situation he finds himself in. Like being locked up in a jail cell in a New York City police station! Harry also uses his knowledge of Let. Foster&apos;s hang ups, as being into S&amp;M, to cause her to lose her cool by hinting to her hubby Capt. Tim what a crazy freak he&apos;s married too. In the end Harry like most nut-cases like himself overplayed his hand in thinking that he&apos;s, not the NYPD, in control of what&apos;s going on in the movie. That leads to Harry ending up just where he put Frances, in a pine box, with him not worried about suffocating to death because of lack of oxygen because by then he wouldn&apos;t really need it anyway!\n\nP.S Earlier in the film there&apos;s a big chase scenes under the Brooklyn West-End elevated subway line that starts at the 62nd Steet station. It&apos;s that very same subway station where the exciting car chase in the film &quot;The French Connection&quot; ended with NYPD Det. Popeye Doyle gunning down his attempted assassin Frog #2 after chasing him down, after he derailed the hijacked subway train that he commandeered, and trapping him there!",

The differing ideologies of Richard &quot;GNU&quot; Stallman and Eric &quot;Open Source&quot; Raymond are also explored. Anybody who has been following Linux for very long, reading websites like Slashdot and Eric Raymond&apos;s &quot;Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; essay will probably already know most this.  However, for those people, the film does offer a chance to see and hear these Linux icons talk--putting faces and voices to people who might otherwise have been just words on a screen.\n\nDespite its Finnish origin, most of this documentary is in English--either the naturally-spoken English of most of the Linux personalities, or a heavily-accented voiceover narrator--with Finnish subtitles.  Only a few of the interviewees (Linus Torvalds&apos;s parents, employees of Chinese Linux corporations) are untranslated (since, after all, the show was originally aimed at Finns)."

      "reviewBody": "I am a stalwart defender of the Euro War sub genre from 1967 - 1970 or so. In the wake of the success of THE DIRTY DOZEN, GUNS OF NAVARONE, THE LONGEST DAY and THE GREAT ESCAPE a number of Italian &amp; Spanish distributors contracted their producers and directors to churn out about 60 - 75 (the precise number is not clear) of WW2 themed potboiler quickies using the same sets, casts, locations, technical crews, and directors as their Spaghetti Western industry. And the best of the examples -- or at least the most watchable/enjoyable -- have the same cartoonishly throwaway feel as a Spaghetti Western. COMMANDOS, FIVE FOR HELL, HELL IN NORMANDY, DESERT COMMANDOS, THE WAR DEVILS, SALT IN THE WOUND: They may not have been particularly well-made or socially relevant (what would German collaborators really have to say about WW2 anyway, except maybe they weren&apos;t as awful as the Nazis?) but are enjoyable escapist fantasy fare aimed straight at the bloodthirsty 12 year old boy in all of us who likes watching stuff get blown up real good. They were Spaghetti Westerns with tanks + machine guns instead of horses + six shooters, and while many were downright absurd they do have a certain charm about them that is very reminiscent of &quot;playing army&quot; as a kid out in the sand lot near the lake house with your cousins. The stories are disposable, the plots re-usable, and the films for the most part unremarkable, made for little or no money, meant to be shown on a double bill one week then gone the next, replaced by 2 more just like it. The Italians may not have crafted particularly memorable films, but you have to admit that they kept busy, and for the most part the Euro War phenomenon resulted in fast paced if somewhat derivative &amp; formulaic efforts that nonetheless had a certain entertainment value that sadly was lost on North American audiences. Aside from COMMANDOS and FIVE FOR HELL they are obscure, unheard of, and incredibly hard to find other than a few crummy public domain releases of tattered, worn full frame TV prints that were rescued from various trash dumpsters after the local TV movie matinÃ©e years ended.\n\nOne of the films you won&apos;t find, however, is WHEN THE BELL TOLLS. I have been criticized for being &quot;lenient&quot; when it comes to evaluating Euro cult genre cinema before, and the war films in particular, but this time I won&apos;t mince words: This movie SUCKS. Even the presence of Brad &quot;Zambo&quot; Harris cannot add much interest, beyond noting that the film features a performance by Brad &quot;Zambo&quot; Harris (one of my favorites of the genre actors) as a priest. He appears in the bookend segments of the film, of which the first (running about 15 minutes) is the only part of the movie with any genuine interest. The rest is utterly excruciating, and not even in a good way. The film was directed by Luigi Batzella aka Paul Solvay, who also wrote and adapted his story for the screenplay and thusly has nobody else but himself to blame. Batzella would later go on to bigger &amp; better things as a sometimes brilliant director of erotic Euro Horror -- his &quot;Nude for Satan&quot; and especially &quot;The Devil&apos;s Wedding Night&quot; are two of that genre&apos;s finest efforts, and little of the promise seen in those movies is evident here. There is perhaps an autobiographical nature to the film, which is all I can think of to explain what a slogging, indulgent, and uninteresting mess of a narrative it attempts to tell. I have sat through it twice and both times failed to understand what the point of it was. Like the good Sgt. Slaughter points out, the movie consists of a series of seemingly random, unconnected set pieces that appear to be parts of different movies, and are so ineptly staged and executed as to make one wonder if this may have been some kind of a put-on or tax dodge.\n\nFrom what I could make of it, the story is about a would-be priest who encounters atrocities at the hands of the Nazis, goes insane, wanders the countryside moaning and screaming and gabbering like a madman, eventually meets up with a group of Spanish or Italian partisans, and then dies. Just how the film gets from point A to B to C is confused, as if large sections of a longer movie are missing, or perhaps a misguided attempt at surrealism was intended. Much of the middle section of the film was shot with some sort of a colored filter on the camera lens, suggesting that it&apos;s either supposed to be interpreted as a flashback or what this insane cleric is witnessing -- Either way it doesn&apos;t make any sense and after about an hour becomes so annoying as to be distracting. The film opens and closes with Father Harris reminiscing about his former colleague with one of their former Nazi foes, a device which might normally have worked to explain what it all means but here only has the effect of reminding us how cool it *WOULD* have been to see Brad &quot;Zambo&quot; Harris taking on the Nazis single handedly &amp; cracking skulls with Gianni Garko or Enzo Girolami. Coulda shoulda woulda. It&apos;s also odd to note that Batzella and Harris would re-team in 1976 for the infamous THE BEAST IN THE HEAT -- which recycles much of the battle footage from this movie, and others -- perhaps the most notorious of the Italian Nazi Exploitation Trash sub genre, and what is amazing about it is that it&apos;s actually a better movie than WHEN THE BELL TOLLS once you get down to it. Which wasn&apos;t an easy feat to pull off.\n\nDefies any kind of a &quot;star&quot; rating system: Anyone who manages to find a copy and watches it all the way through deserves some kind of a medal."

Faye &quot;Milano&quot; Dunaway is a reporter for the New York Herald sent to Israel to get some first page stories and makes the shocking experience that the stories she stumbles into can&apos;t be written down, published or even defined, the social psychology of the constant conflict being so undefinably complicated. If the ambition of the film was to get as near to a documentary as possible, it has succeeded, as it is the best possible and most convincing effort I have seen to pinpoint something of the overwhelming political, ethnical and human complexity of the Israel-Palestine problem. It is a constant war that has been going on since the partition in 1948 and gradually developed into something of a continuous nightmare of imminent danger and threats to your life wherever you go and whatever you do in Israel, and the moment you relax and allow yourself a moment off guard, something might explode and erupt in massacre and bloodshed, mainly victimising innocents. The whole history of modern Israel is nothing but a story of survival, which this film make shockingly clear. There is no tourism here, no sacred pilgrimage, no religion, not even any culture or traditions, but just plain journalistic facts revealing the whole stage of the Israeli drama of reality. Especially valuable condoning this character is the presence of Rabbi Meir Kahane, speaking his mind openly in the film, who shortly afterwards was assassinated by Palestinians (1990; the film was released in 1992).",

      "reviewBody": "My summary is not meant as harsh criticism--it&apos;s just a fact that this film has limited appeal to the average viewer. The average person out there simply doesn&apos;t care about terms like &apos;New Wave&apos; or artistic differences between directors--they just want to be entertained. So, if you just want to be entertained, you&apos;ll find this tough going and if you are a cinephile, you&apos;ll probably get more out of this.\n\nThe film is about the French New Wave movement--and in particular, FranÃ§ois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. While there were certainly other New Wave directors (such as Resnais, Rohmer and Chabrol), the film focuses in on these two for several reasons. First, they were among the most vocal and important New Wave directors--sort of like the prophets for the New Wave god. Second, their relationship, over time, changed--going from close friends and guys who respected each other&apos;s work to arch-rivals.\n\nThe documentary is filled with TONS of clips of New Wave films--not just of the two subjects but most of the New Wave directors (I say &apos;most&apos; because some, such as Melville, are omitted). For fans of the style, it&apos;s a great chance to relive memories of great films. What the film lacks, however, are interviews. While Truffaut died long ago, there certainly are many others who I would like to have heard from but the film instead is just film clips and narration. Because of this, it&apos;s all a bit frustrating. It&apos;s also a bit frustrating because the break between the two directors seemed a bit vague--as if a bit rushed and not explained adequately. I understood this section a bit better than most (having seen and reviewed a gazillion films), but just thought it could have and should have been more clear. Overall, interesting for some but also a bit short and perhaps lacking depth.",

      "reviewBody": "Let me start off by saying the Naked Brothers Band are not the Beatles.\n\nThis is not to say that they aren&apos;t reasonably competent musicians; the scene where Nat is jamming out with Cindy Lauper has to be seen to be truly appreciated. Though most of the &quot;live&quot; music scenes are actually lip-synced, the notes and rhythms being played are true to the sounds that the viewer hears.\n\nNo, the reason for the disclaimer is the reason this is a reasonably decent movie. If you are paying attention and you are a casual Beatles fan, you will notice the allusions run thick throughout. If you are a hard-core Beatles fan, you&apos;ll notice that the fictional &quot;Silver Boulders&quot; were modeled on the very real Beatles.\n\nThe plot line of the former should be familiar to anyone who knows the history of the later. Of course, in this version no one ends up getting shot and the band comes back together. But the pivotal events of both bands (up to and including the band&apos;s break-up precipitated by an Asian love-interest) happen to line up surprisingly well... Almost as if it were a mockumentary and not the serious documentary it actually is. The finale, a reprise on the roof of &quot;Crazy, Crazy Car&quot; (the Silver Boulders&apos; chart-topper), is a classic call-out.\n\nUnlike many other shows on the Nickelodeon network, NBB is a surprisingly smart take on tween entertainment. It has its detractors already, but this reviewer&apos;s gut feeling is that they weren&apos;t paying attention enough to notice the small flickers of genius underneath the rather more commercial silliness that makes this movie (and the soon-to-come half-hour spin-off) a viable market proposition.\n\nIf this show maintains its integrity (more likely than not, since it maintains its writing and producing teams intact: namely, Polly Draper, mother of the show&apos;s stars Nat and Alex Wolff), it could turn out to be a surprise. Placed against its competition, mostly cute middle-school sit comes or the insipid star vehicles infesting the Disney Channel, NBB comes out on top. It&apos;s honest, amusing, at times a bit saccharine, but mostly surprising.",

      "reviewBody": "A dialectic is established here across time and space. &quot;Here&quot;, in 1974 present time, a Parisian bourgeois family is watching TV in their cosy livingroom. &quot;Elsewhere&quot;, in 1970, Godard and his Dziga Vertov company is in Palestine making a documentary about a strife that goes back in centuries and is expected to blossom into a revolution. I won&apos;t say I&apos;m glad the documentary was never completed, but I&apos;m glad that what started as political rhetoric four years later was allowed to be reflected upon in the aftermath of that political rhetoric, what it addresses and what it fails to, and how the artistic voice is shaped in that gap.\n\nI will preface this by saying that I admire in Godard not the sentiment to formulate the political rhetoric, but the conviction to formulate it in harm&apos;s way. It&apos;s one thing to play out a little reenactment of a revolution in the safety of the Parisian countryside, as he did in Week End, and it&apos;s a different thing altogether to leave behind your life and film in Fatah&apos;s stomping grounds. All this coming from the same filmmaker who years earlier was in position to make a film with Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance. I applaud the breach and the reclusiveness. When Godard said &quot;fin du cinema&quot;, he was only talking for himself, but he meant it, at least at the time.\n\nI know Herzog can&apos;t stand Godard, but a film like this reminds me of him. How he took a camera across the world to make small essayist pieces that would never be exposed to a big audience, the sense of adventure and exploration and the openness to the possibilities of making a film that &quot;catches life unawares&quot;. Herzog probed the universe and the human soul, sought truth above and below reality, in the ecstacy that liberates from it. Godard is an intellectual, I see in him a filmmaker sadly anguished inside his own head. His folly, indeed the folly of the intellectual, is that he needs a cause to be passionate about. If inspiration doesn&apos;t come from the heart he will seek it in the outwards. Godard found it in the revolution. What fascinates me with Godard then is watching him struggle to break free from the confines of his head. I see a lot of conceit in his expression, but I am intrigued by the struggle to express it. With, and often without, regard to expectations, his own and those of others.\n\nThe beauty of Ici et Ailleurs for me is that Godard self-examinates. Another reviewer aptly put it that &quot;no one questions the political image like Godard&quot;. Here, he plays tricks with the image and the word, he connects the Middle East struggle back to France, to Hitler, to the October Revolution of 1917. But what is more apt for me, what I appreciate here, is that Godard begins to question the political image of Godard, by extention the concept or conceit of &quot;cinema verite&quot;.\n\nNear the end, as we see on screen a group of Palestinian guerillas huddling together to devise strategy, all of whom would be dead in a few months (we see their dead bodies), Godard ruefully laments they didn&apos;t say anything. The female narrator interrupts and says &quot;you, you could have said something&quot;.\n\nThis doesn&apos;t so much question the person, because whay could Godard have said to sway a band of armed guerillas, but the art. Dziga Vertov imagined a cinema that &quot;caught life unawares&quot; in the hope that, through the artifice of a cinema narrative, a truth could be surmised. What happens though when in the pursuit of that &quot;kino-pravda&quot; (cine-truth) we only observe but don&apos;t participate? Does the filmed image carry moral complications and is the camera complicit in what it sees? Food for thought."

The two plots aren&apos;t exact, but they&apos;re similar enough to suppose that the writer must have seen the old Chaney flick.\n\nIn any case, DARK STORM is a poor excuse for a film. Half of it is a silly sci-fi outing, with random balaclava-wearing goons going around hassling pretty female scientists and extras getting killed. The other half is a disaster movie, with dark matter storms destroying buildings in Seattle and Romania, of all places. One of the storms destroys a high rise in scenes uncomfortably reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks. Needless to say, the CGI effects are horrible and the acting equally bad, particularly from a slumming-it Baldwin, who really should know better...",

Sure, it&apos;s full of sex and naked people, but it also manages to be erotic and sensual at the same time. It&apos;s certainly not the commercialized absurdity that you&apos;ll find late night on certain premium channels. More than that, though, is that it&apos;s a decent psychological study of a man who&apos;s completely divorced himself from reality. Like so many celebs of our time, money and success has allowed him to distance himself from whatever parts of reality that make him uncomfortable. Emily&apos;s naive and honest approach manages to reach him. His speech near the end, before the final &apos;scene,&apos; is really impressive, and Mikey really is a great actor. Sure, Ms. Otis leaves something to be desired, but she&apos;s working in a role where her lack of comfort helps the part. Emily is out of her element, just is the actress playing her is, and even if this makes her transparent, it also makes her believable. Jaqueline Bisset is wonderful as always. All in all, if you watch this film without fast forwarding from sex scene to sex scene, you&apos;ll see a fairly human story mixed with a sexual journey that I think Zora Neale Hurston would have appreciated.",

The credits of &quot;Ferien mit Piroschka&quot; say that motives of Hartung&apos;s novel were used again, but this is just not true: the makers only used the name Piroschka (and gave it to a doll!) and probably hoped to use Hoffmann&quot;s film as a recommendation for their own. They came up with an incredibly &quot;dis-charming&quot; film, a hotchpot of romance, farce, German arrogance (tourists in Hungary), Nazi presence in Hungary, the cold war etc. etc., without all this ever being an unity. It is badly acted, directed and edited, with GÃ¶tz George in another of his bad parts and director&apos;s wife Tordai a very boring female lead. Nice gypsy music and dances cannot save the viewer from getting drunk on plenty of Hungarian wine to endure this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Writer/director Satoshi Miki offers an amusing tale of a vapid housewife who is rescued from the monotony of feeding a turtle for her tanshin funin husband by being recruited as a spy for an unstated foreign power. Life gains meaning as she strives to hone her until now taken-for-granted ordinariness.\n\nJuri Ueno as Suzume Katakura keeps it fairly reigned in, reacting with gasp of incredulity to the slightly surreal mayhem unleashed around her by the assembled well-known comedians. There is a dancing barber, a secret ramen genius, a tofu-making small arms expert, and her friend Peacock, the quirky, charismatic YÃ» Aoi, who wants to live in Paris with a Frenchman and a view of the Eiffel Tower. Aoi is a great talent and it is slightly disappointing that she is under-used here. Perhaps that is deliberate, to prevent her overshadowing Ueno.\n\nThe comedy is quick-fire and this is a series of loosely connected sketches rather than a compelling narrative. Production values are low and reek of micro-budget movie-making, but the comedy is funny so all is forgiven. The star here really is Miki&apos;s script and sense of comic timing (though more visuality and less narration would have been welcome). And a relief to see a J director with a sense of economy - the 90-minute running time is just right. Pleasant fare for those who share the director&apos;s light, frothy sense of humour.",

The power of this movie comes mainly from its inherent defense against accusations of biased reporting of events, peoples&apos; facial expressions and appearances, words taken out of context and revisionist history. This power was due entirely to the fact that there was no script, no actors, no makeup artists, no retakes and special effects. This movie was cinema veritae. Joe McCarthy, Roy Cohn, Ray Welsch and all the others shown were themselves speaking their thoughts and feelings without varnish.\n\nFor those who wondered how Hitler ascended to power, between McCarthy and J. Edgar Hoover, it could have happened here, Those of us who understand this have a special obligation to protect this country for those who don&apos;t see, can&apos;t see or don&apos;t care. Freedom is very vulnerable. The movie demonstrated this.",

Quickly, the strange locale, the constant winds, and the appearances of a strapping handyman sends two of the sisters to distraction. Gripping drama from Powell and Pressburger has moments of sly humor, incredible beauty. Some of the close-ups (as when Sister Superior Deborah Kerr remembers fox-hunting in her youth, or when Sister Ruth discloses her desires of the flesh) are fascinating, almost surreal, and the finale is a wind-whipping frenzy of emotional overload. A few characters--such as Sabu&apos;s General and Jean Simmons&apos; young tart--are not expanded upon and simply evaporate, but the film is still a stunner, depicting need and survival with colorful, melodramatic flourish. ***1/2 from ****",

There were some really charming parts about the cycle of life showing animals that have caring and dedicated Mothers. I especially enjoyed the Snow Monkeys and the Brazilian Capuchin Monkeys. They were pretty cute and crafty in how they kept warm and fed. Another favourite part of mine were the Elephants marching towards water and the rock climbing goats.\n\nDaniel Craig has a nice voice for narration and the scenery was breathtaking. I don&apos;t watch a lot Documentaries like this one, but I enjoyed it.",

      "name": "Surprisingly decent genre offering from The Asylum",
      "reviewBody": "Not sure what makes this Western genre offering from The Asylum so surprisingly decent. My guess is pure mathematics. When it doesn&apos;t have to spend money on special effects from bargain-basement CGI house Tiny Juggernaut, The Asylum can devote those same dollars to scriptwriting, direction and location scenery.\n\nThis is essentially a mockbuster of the new &quot;True Grit,&quot; with Barry Van Dyke unconvincing in the Jeff Bridges role and cutie pie nobody Sage Mears in the Hailee Steinfeld part, rewritten here as an alcoholic milf who hires Van Dyke to help her seek revenge against the bad guys who raped her and murdered her husband and children.\n\nIt&apos;s not his fault, but Barry looks so much like his father Dick, it&apos;s hard to take him seriously as a rough bounty hunter. You half expect him to burst into &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; in every scene.\n\nAnd because he must have some sort of contract that says he appears in every third Asylum movie, Greg Evigan shows up as an old, fat, useless sheriff who only serves to remind us baby boomers how old, fat and useless we&apos;ve gotten since &quot;My Two Dads&quot; too.\n\nIt&apos;s true the weaponry here is anachronistic and the money shown in the poker game scene is too modern. And yeah, pretty much every cowboy in this movie rides his horse like it&apos;s the first time he&apos;s ever been on one. But really, even the most authentic of Westerns have always been revisionist fantasies. The Asylum isn&apos;t asking too much when requiring we take this one with an extra grain of salt.\n\nWhy? Because ultimately, it works. For some reason, &quot;6 Guns&quot; works as a whole to create a harmless cowboy flick that&apos;s better than you would expect from the king of direct-to-DVD cheese. After all, this is the company that gave us &quot;Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus,&quot; so I think we need to count the few blessings The Asylum throws us.",

With fake computer grade and attendance records, Ferris has it made.\n\nThe scene where the principal hitches a ride on a school bus after having been &quot;torn up&quot; by Doberman watch dogs is worth the ticket price (Oh Yeah!).

      "reviewBody": "On the first day of his school holidays, young Lucas (Ben Keyworth) accompanies his blind mother Miriam (Fanny Ardant) to the West London clinic where she teaches a knitting class. At the clinic, talk is of the vicious razor attack on one of the regular visitors by person unknown. Lucas&apos;s mother introduces her son to her pretty blind friend Rose (Clare Holman), with whom he forms an infatuation. The lad accompanies Rose to the studio of photographer Tony (Paul McGann), where she is to have her picture taken with her blind fiancÃ© Jim (Jeremy Flynn).\n\nLucas wanders off and sneaks into a house, where he plays with matches and half-inches a telescope; through the bedroom window, he witnesses a second brutal razor attack on another blind woman. The chief superintendent in charge of the case is Lucas&apos; father Frank (James Fox). Does his son hold the key to the identity of the slasher? Is the creepy window cleaner at the clinic (Struan Rodger) responsible for the attacks? Could it be Tony the photographer, who puts lipstick on graveyard statues? Or is leering locksmith Tom Miller (David Thewlis) behind the crimes?\n\nKeeping schtum about what he has seen, Lucas continues his stroll through the neighbourhood, stopping at the local cemetery to visit his secret hideout in a mausoleum and to feed his canine pal Toby, after which he explores a railway tunnel. At the nearby station, a third victim feels the cold steel of a cut-throat razor. That night, Lucas sneaks out of bed to visit the graveyard where he spies on his neighbours with his telescope; there, he disturbs Tom Miller, who is also doing a spot of peeping. Lucas is chased by Miller, but escapes when Toby comes to the rescue.\n\nLucas continues to spy on the locals, peering through a window at shutterbug Tony, who has convinced Rose to pose topless for him. As the lad watches, Tony approaches Rose with a razor and starts to cut her legs; Lucas rushes to her rescue, stabbing the photographer in the eye with one of his mother&apos;s knitting needles. At which point the film pulls an about-face, yanking the rug from under the viewer&apos;s feet...\n\nThe movie cuts to Lucas in his bedroom. He is wearing glasses with thick lenses due to a condition that could lead to a total loss of sight unless he undergoes an operation (which could also leave him blind if it is not a success). His mother is no longer unable to see, and she is pregnant. Rose is now his sister, who is about to get married to Tony, and she can also see. His father is a florist.\n\nEverything we have seen up until this point has been through the failing eyes of an &apos;unreliable narrator&apos;: a frightened, confused young boy facing a very uncertain future. The razor maniac terrorising the blind doesn&apos;t exist, and is most likely a manifestation of the boy&apos;s fear of going under the surgeon&apos;s knife. All of the menacing characters - Tony, Tom and the window cleaner - are, in reality, very friendly.\n\nAs his operation draws nearer, Lucas continues to slide deeper into an imaginary world where he is surrounded by the blind, and the only way to protect himself is with his trusty knitting needle. When a scared Lucas sees Toby at the window, he imagines the dog as a snarling rabid beast and stabs it in the head with his needle, and when his mother arrives home from hospital, Toby&apos;s fragile mental state puts the life of his new baby sister in danger.\n\nBlurring the lines between reality and the imaginary, Afraid Of The Dark is an intelligent, challenging watch that keeps the viewer on their toes. The mid-film switcheroo seems to be a sticking point for some, but I loved the way the story suddenly changed without resorting to clumsy exposition: it&apos;s a brave move that has to be applauded. The second half of the film is a tense character study of very troubled boy, and Keyworth is superb in his role - utterly chilling as he covers up the crime of killing Toby, and then sets his sights on baby Tess. The film&apos;s finalÃ© sees the infant being rescued before Lucas can do her any harm, followed by the operation on the boy&apos;s eyes, which is declared a success. Post-operation, Lucas appears to be back to normal, his fears having evaporated, but when he is giving sister Tess a cuddle at the end, it&apos;s hard not to think that the worst is yet to come...\n\n7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for the cameos from Hilary Mason and Catriona MacColl, both of whom had previously played blind characters in cult horror films: Mason in Nicolas Roeg&apos;s Don&apos;t Look Now (1973) and MacColl in Lucio Fulci&apos;s The Beyond (1981).",

      "reviewBody": "It was different and refreshing when I first watched it. If I wrote a review the very moment I saw the film, I would have given it a 9 out of 10. Now, after almost half a year, the feeling has passed and I feel the film is very overrated.\n\nEllen Page does give a very good performance. It can be seen she cares about the role and she gives the role all her energy and devotion. Yet...is her performance Oscar worthy? That is up for debate. Like the film, her performance is good but forgettable.\n\nThe rest of the cast is solid. Jennifer Garner does her job rather well, and is there a more awkward kid than Michael Cera? He is born to play Bleeker. Nevertheless, Diablo Cody does not deserve her Oscar. Truthfully, her writing is shallow and empty. There are more deserving candidates.\n\n&quot;Juno&quot; is good, but empty. There is no deep or life-changing message within the film, and this film is just like the language within the film and the western culture: a fad. After the initial awe and surprise pass, it will not stand the test of time and will not be remembered.\n\nI would recommend Waitress, because it has more &quot;heart&quot;, or Knocked Up, because it is more funny. Juno is somewhere in between, and quite frankly, it remains there. It takes the quality of both films, but it does not exceed or stand out from either films.\n\n6/10",

      "name": "Dolph hits the high notes again with one of his best!",
      "reviewBody": "Dolph&apos;s latest film, and his third foray into directing, is once again one of his career best. Like The Mechanik, Dolph puts to bed some of the murkier days of his back catalogue, and proves, that the best man to help bring Dolph Lundgren back into the limelight, is Dolph Lundgren! Delving once more into a film with a theme of revenge, as in The Mechanik, there might have been a niggling worry, that re-treading that ground could breed familiarity. But what Dolph delivers is an action film in style, tone, and look, that is not only far removed from what he&apos;s previously done, but a film that just looks and feels fresh. There aren&apos;t many action films out there like Missionary Man, on a visual, tonal level.\n\nIn Missionary Man, Dolph stars as Ryder, a mysterious stranger who rides into town for a friends funeral. Pretty soon he&apos;s rubbing local oppressor John Reno up the wrong way. As the film progresses we start to see Ryder has other motives for being in town. It&apos;s a modern western and has some great western trademarks, including a fantastic climax. However though on paper the story has similar arcs as Dolph&apos;s previous directing effort, Missionary Man is such a contrast. It&apos;s a whole different style of flick, and with Dolph&apos;s increased level or creative control since his last directing gig, it&apos;s a more complete vision.\n\nAs director, Dolph really has a great visual eye here. What&apos;s great about the film, is that beyond the choice of super-16, it feels as if Dolph is in complete control. He&apos;s constrained by a tight budget certainly, but he spends it brilliantly, and really creates a great atmosphere. Dolph, his DP Bing Rao, and steadicam operator, George R Niedson combine to create a visual delight. There&apos;s some great shots in this film, and it has a feeling of being a graphic novel brought to life, particularly with some almost picturesque still shots. Dolph has gone all out here. At times it feels quite arty, and considering this is a DTV film, and a Dolph Lundgren film, that&apos;s quite something! The choice of super-16 is one that can be fraught with peril. There&apos;s a graininess to it, and the way it picks up light and colour can sometimes make a film look bad if not in the hands of a capable or inspired DP. Of course not only is the film well shot, but given it was shot on super- 16, there was the advantage of it being mastered directly onto HD. This also allowed for easier digital grading, as well as ensuring the film looked crisp. I mean this sucker has a great transfer. Dolph makes full use of the grading tool, and gives the film an almost monochrome look. The de-saturated picture adds to the foreboding atmosphere, and is also ably helped along by the low key and effective score by Elia Cmiral (Ronin, The Mechanik). Elsewhere Dolph knows action, having worked with the likes of John Woo, and he delivers here. There&apos;s short punctuations of violence throughout the film, before the inevitable, and just downright badass showdown. Dolph just goes Terminator on some biker dudes and it rocks the action Kasbah! As actor, Dolph does well here too. He&apos;s no Olivier, he knows it himself, but he plays to his strength, playing the Eastwood style man of few words, but immense badassedness (not a real word, but should be!). Parallels with Clint will be made of course, both being movie tough guys who made the jump from actor to writer and director. Dolph will not likely have the success of Clint, but he&apos;s the straight to video equivalent I guess, and there&apos;s no great shame in that anymore. Dolph&apos;s got that tough guy charisma. Nowadays what we lack in cinema is action stars, with the sheer hardness and tough as nails presence that Clint, Bronson, Arnie, Sly, and the likes of Seagal and Lundgren, used to deliver. We&apos;ve not had any new action men come along who had the same presence, merely pretenders like Vin Diesel and The Rock. There&apos;s also been thesp&apos;s like Matt Damon, who while magnificent as Bourne isn&apos;t gonna settle down into the handing people their asses genre. You do have to, with the odd exception, have to look in the direct to video market for a good old school hardass action flick, and visit the old guard like Dolph and Jean Claude.\n\nThe remainder of the cast are mixed. Given the films budget, the support cast isn&apos;t great. The incidental characters, probably including locals given a place on screen, aren&apos;t great. Thankfully though the important roles are well filled. As Reno, Matthew Tompkins makes for a good bad guy. Also starring is August Schellenberg a very good actor who fans of Free Willy will likely remember, and he adds a bit of gravitas to proceedings. Young actress Chelsea Ricketts is superb, and surely has a bright future ahead of her (the kid who plays her older brother isn&apos;t great to be honest- but his role is insignificant). John Enos III stars as the lead biker and Ryder&apos;s main foe, and though he only comes in toward the end of the movie, he does a great job.\n\nOverall, while the film won&apos;t win originality prizes, it feels fresh because of the style. It&apos;s just a good old fashioned R rated action film, proving big set pieces and oodles of CGI do not make a good action film (*cough* Transformers!! *cough*). Dolph is getting more assured behind the camera with every film, while also showing a versatility to switch style and tone. All three of his films have been markedly different, but Missionary Man stands out as something that is perhaps his most unique work. Action fans will not be disappointed. I&apos;d love to see Dolph given a bit more money to play around with. ****",

      "reviewBody": "I barely remember reading Harold and the Purple Crayon as a kid, but the memory came back after watching the newly released movie of the same name. This follows up the book. Harold (Zachary Levi), now grown up, is still having adventures with his two friends Moose (Lil Rel Howery) and Porcupine (Tanya Reynolds), drawing whatever came to his mind with his magical purple crayon, kind of like Green Lantern. One day, the old man (Alfred Molina) who narrates their lives suddenly stops, giving Harold the idea to draw a door to the real world. Thus begins a typical &quot;fish-out-of-water&quot; story involving a naÃ¯ve hero, a single mom named Terri (Zooey Deschanel) who hits Harold with her car, and a desperate librarian/author named Gary (Jemaine Clement) who just wants to be recognized. This takes a bit to get going but it definitely grew on me as it went on. It&apos;s cute and heartwarming for the whole family. The actors knew what movie this was, especially Clement, who is very fun to watch. This movie came out at a very bad time, failing to compete with much bigger movies and absolutely bombing in the box office. Saying that, I highly recommend taking your kids to see HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON.",

      "reviewBody": "I have been looking forward to &apos;Australia&apos; for a long time. Though the experience from &apos;Australia&apos; isn&apos;t as magical as Baz Luhrmann&apos;s spectacular &apos;Moulin Rouge&apos; nor is it as well executed (on the technical side), but I still found it very enjoyable. &apos;Australia&apos; works on multiple levels. The film is a mixture of adventure, action, romance and detailed history (like in any larger than life epic movie). All of them are put well together in the film. Luhrmann&apos;s vast imagination and creativity is very evident in his portrayal of the aboriginal culture and how that&apos;s where the heart of Australia lies. To move the story further, Luhrman shows the conflict of the aboriginals with the Europeans and its chaotic result. The film introduces plenty of historical themes and serves as a thumbnail. Yet, Luhrmann does not shy away from experimenting with the magical side of his film. The main story itself is very formulaic but enjoy it like you would see a Hollywood blockbuster and roll along.\n\nThe Australian landscape is dazzling to look at. It&apos;s a country that has always fascinated me and arises my desire to go there and such movies only remind me of that feeling. Mandy Walker&apos;s cinematography is fantastic allowing landscape itself to serve as a key character (for obvious reasons). The lighting could have used some betterment, especially in the action scenes where they used blue screen filter (it was painfully obvious). I also felt that the CGI was overused and at times it does interfere with the natural beauty in the background. The soundtrack is awesome as its a mixture of spiritual beats and old classics.\n\nAt the centre of &apos;Australia&apos; is an Aboriginal child of mixed race, Nullah, who is played by a likable Brandon Walters. Even though Walters doesn&apos;t exactly get it &apos;right&apos; with scenes that demanded him to display complex emotions, he does very well with the comic scenes and does not go over the top by &apos;being cute&apos;. A vivacious Nicole Kidman is absolutely marvelous as the strong-minded Sarah Ashley. She displays her knack for comedy, is superbly restrained in the emotional sequences and shares a wonderful chemistry with her co-stars. Hugh Jackman&apos;s Drover may have been inspired by Harrison Ford&apos;s Indiana Jones, Paul Hogan&apos;s Crocodile Dundee and the dozens of famous Clint Eastwood characters. Jackman pulls off the part quite naturally. He and Kidman are magic on screen. The supporting cast is commendable. I liked the actors who play the colourful characters at Ashley&apos;s ranch. Jack Thompson provides some brilliant comic relief. Bryan Brown has a strong presence in a limited role and David Wenham is menacing as the evil Fletcher.\n\nLuhrmann&apos;s attempt to entertain and amuse the viewer seems genuine and the man has done a lot of research and enlightens the viewer of Australia history. Forget these &apos;Titanics&apos; and &apos;Pearl Harbours&apos;. &apos;Australia&apos; reminds us of the time when people enjoyed grand movies such as &apos;Gone With The Wind&apos; and &apos;The Wizard Of Oz&apos;. Through the numerous references, this movie pays tribute to many of the classics that have made a place in the history of cinema. Yet, this enchanting movie stands on its own."

      "reviewBody": "Follow-up to Salt and Pepper where Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. played two very middle-aged swingers running a night spot called Salt and Pepper. This time around the two get into trouble for repeated problems and ask Lawford&apos;s lookalike brother(yes, he plays him as well) for money. Turns out he is a Lord and owns the family castle given up by Pepper so long ago. Also turns out he is involved in smuggling diamonds and is a double agent, etc... Lawford&apos;s brother is killed and Lawford as Pepper assumes his brother&apos;s role and hilarity is to ensue - NOT! While I believe this to be a more engaging and slightly more amusing vehicle than the original Salt and Pepper, it really doesn&apos;t have a lot going for it. Jerry Lewis directs his buddies Davis and Lawford and with his special brand of humour. We get Davis trying to be Jerry Lewis in several scenes: a scene with him seeing how everything is huge in his new bedroom at the castle where he looks and everything looks so huge. I have seen Lewis pull this same thing countless times. Davis; not sure if this is a compliment or not, is no Lewis; however. He just doesn&apos;t have the same lunatic spirit though he has some scenes which are slightly amusing. Most of the time he does come off as being very flat because the material is so tiresome and over-used. The brightest spots in the movie are Lawford&apos;s as he pulls off playing the two brothers really rather well. The plot is ridiculous. Are we really to believe that these two over-the-hill guys are hip swingers? Davis of course sings a few tunes including the somewhat catchy &quot;One More Time&quot; as the opening and end credits roll. For me the only fascinating aspect of the film is the addition of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in brief - and I mean BRIEF - cameos. In one scene Davis finds a wooden secret panel in the castle that has behind it , down some steps, a laboratory with Cushing standing, a woman on a gurney, and Lee bearing fangs. Cushing has a brief line or so as does Lee. Their screen time is embarrassingly slight. Why Lewis didn&apos;t given them a bit more time amazes me as THIS scene is the opening scene in this film&apos;s theatrical trailer! Unfortunately Cushing and Lee maybe have 30 seconds of screen time. But if you are a completist in either&apos;s filmography, you will have to endure One More Time at least once.",

PIXAR really outdid themselves with the hyper-realistic CGI in here, and the simple story of a blue umbrella falling for a red umbrella in a sea of indifferent, monochromatic umbrellas. The subtle expressions of their surrounding environment can really captivate future animators who&apos;re looking for something to build off of.\n\nUnfortunately, it&apos;s slightly awkward to watch in a theater, as it comes before Monsters University, and it makes me feel as though some people may have walked into the wrong movie. I really want them to enjoy it, but because of its placement, it&apos;s hard to do so.\n\nI&apos;m sure PIXAR had good intentions placing it before Monsters University started, but with a bunch of kids coming in to watch MU, I don&apos;t think it will garner much positive attention. I, for one, like it, but parents of rambunctious kids may not find it funny when their kid starts to act out from boredom. Maybe those kids will appreciate this short in the future, but not today.",

But the rest of the cast is great also, and this one is another success that only UK is capable of making. Surprising among the ensemble cast is Naomi Watts, that strikes in another metamorphosis (accent included). Always sporting a smile on its face, it seems like a paradox that there could be so much comedy to be taken from a movie that could be called &quot;Four Funerals and One Wedding&quot;, but you&apos;ll understand when you see it.",

      "reviewBody": "Dan Ireland&apos;s film The Velocity of Gary* (*Not his real name)is both moving and involving, painting a honest depiction of unconventional love in an almost abstract, fantastical way. I tracked this film down (not an easy task here in the UK) as a loyal follower of the great Thomas Jane and was not disappointed when I finally got to watch it. Jane plays Gary, a hustler in New York who falls under the loving wing of Valentino, an adult film actor played by Vincent D&apos; Onofrio. Both have an immediate attraction to one another (sexual? paternal, in Valentino&apos;s case?) but things are complicated by the presence of Valentino&apos;s shrieking girlfriend Mary Carmen (Salma Hayek). A brutal yet genuinely loving emotional triangle is formed, then tragedy strikes as Valentino is diagnosed with AIDS. Adapted by James Still from his own one man play, this is raw, passionate stuff, and not to everyone&apos;s taste. But to those who want to taste something a little different, I highly recommend the picture. Two factors keep the interest throughout: 1) Jane. His performance is honest, brave and utterly believable. He has to be the best working young actor in American film at this point in time. 2) The films original score by Peitor Angell is as moving as its source material. The films theme (though it only appears during the opening credits and during a festival some time later) is a beautiful piece of film composition. This is an intimate little flick which, whilst never exactly &apos;feel-good&apos;, highlights the gift of life and making the most of it."

      "reviewBody": "No one here yet has commented much on the artistry of this film. It was adeptly shot, with a raw, on-the-fly style that caught fascinating shot after shot of Iraqi civilians and daily life (for techies, it was shot on a Panasonic 24P camera, and was almost certainly transfered to film). The editing and music are aggressive, maintaining an energy and attention span befitting the young filmmakers. Yet this is no MTV hack-job. The filmmakers catch the emotions of the film with simple beauty, such as the running storyline of Frank being reunited with his family, and showing their love, customs, and feelings. There&apos;s a smart balance between these moments and the ideological chaos that envelopes the family and the entire country.\n\nOthers here have given good synopses of the film, so I won&apos;t add more to that other than to say the structure is intentionally meandering. The filmmakers in the &quot;extras&quot; section of the DVD discuss how they wanted to portray an emotional journey through Iraq from many perspectives, rather than to give a linear tale neatly guided by a voice-over. Don&apos;t look either for an intellectual dissection of the Iraqi situation from the filmmakers -- but expect a dozen or more dissections from those on-camera, ranging from idiotic (a U.S. soldier who thinks we&apos;re there just because we like to go to war and test weapons every few decades) to insightful. And the insights come from all sides, which tells us something we should have remembered from Vietnam: the real problem is not good vs. evil, but rather the clash of two civilizations with a complete lack of understanding for each other.",

The only weakness of this film is its somehow tv like atmosphere and the reason is that Farhadi was new in cinema and before that had directed and written lots of TV masterpieces. Actually this film was one episode of his tv serie &apos;the story of a city,&quot; but because af its really dark and bitter story, he didn&apos;t get approval.",

His wimpy little voice commands no authority in this role.\n\nAll in all, the movie was fun but I can definitely see why it did not get a big U.S. release since &quot;Eagle Eye&quot; is probably still in everyone&apos;s mind and the miscasting of actors for the most important roles didn&apos;t help either.",

      "reviewBody": "While I disagree with many of the reviews--and the low overall score for this film, I do understand as it is not your typical take on a vampire film. This is a story of relationships; vampires only play a small part in the film, but reflect the confusion and choices we make when choosing how to live and who we choose to spend our lives with. What would your choice be if you had to choose for eternity? More realistic than most films of the genre, the main characters struggle with tentative connections that are sharply forced when an accident causes an irrevocable change of plans.\n\nThe back and forth indecision of the characters and the uncertainty over the morality of their choices underlies the majority of the film and in this sense was both satisfyingly realistic and annoying. Most films in any genre have boy meet girl, they fall in love, and then do whatever it takes to be together for ever. You won&apos;t find this kind of romance here and sometimes it simply becomes irritating--if refreshing.\n\nPersonally I found the ending unsatisfactory, but more unpredictable than most films of this nature. As a result of this ambiguity some viewers will not like this film, but if you can empathize with a pair of young people thrust into a different world that seems to force a forever-after choice, you&apos;ll--if not enjoy, then appreciate the storyline. The acting was low key but decent and the dialogue pretty realistic--while nothing about the music or cinematography stood out, that&apos;s actually the sign of a decent film.",

      "name": "Violette and Dr. Hannibal Lecter can be an adorable couple!",
      "reviewBody": "It is an atrociously unlawful act depicted in Chabrol&apos;s sensational melodrama, the based-on-a- true-story type (a murder case in 1933) which would usually generate a slew of horrific feedback in the social news commentary, about an adolescent girl poisons her parents in order to back up her gold-digger boyfriend to elope together. \n\nWhat makes the film so gravely provocative is the entire scheme of Violette (Huppert) seems so juvenile and wanton, the viciousness is inexorable and beyond any logical solace. Violette is a lackadaisical, apolitical and promiscuous teenager, although at the age of 24, Huppert is unbecoming to pass for the role, but Chabrol adroitly restyles Violette with a more precocious patina, the dexterous transition between the good girl veneer when she is with her parents and the motel-hogging and man-hunting hussy potently incites Huppert&apos;s chameleonic escapade, each and every single frame zooms in on her unprovoked aloofness and obtrusive sex appeal. She is perpetually indulging in her own pathetic realm, sneers at her parents&apos; clumsy intercourse and disgruntled at their ordinary petit bourgeois trivia, she is in an impetuous situation to find an egress, but the man in her dreams is a major disappointment as viewers all being well- informed in advance, it is money he is on the lookout for. The affair is doomed to futility, in some sense Violette knows it fairly well, but it is the defects (the egocentric selfishness, deep- rooted misanthrope and diabolic cruelty) in her character blind her sight, poison her mind and abet her into carrying on the abhorrent action. \n\nAfter the murder plan goes as expected and the lousy gas-accident cover-up, Germaine, the mother (Audran) survives the poison, it is not a detective story after all, instead, it is an awkward moment of facing the truth, but Violette&apos;s vituperative accusation to her late father (Carmet) in order to justify her motive shatters all the expectation if there is any mercifulness left in her, she is an archetype of the malevolent side of human nature, an anomaly which defies all the logical interpretation, she and Dr. Hannibal Lecter can be an adorable couple! \n\nStÃ©phane Audran, whom I just appraised for her delicate performance in BABETTE&apos;S FEAST (1987, 8/10), is astounding here as the overbearing but doting mother of Violette, she is the one we can mostly project our compassion on, yet, we might also prompt to question her tutelage, perhaps she is at least partially responsible for the decadence of her sole daughter, how Violette&apos;s double act (constantly stays in motels and hangs out someone the parents have never met) can blatantly evade a mother&apos;s instinctive nature is a shade bemusing, not to mention the intaking of unknown medicine for the sake of hereditary syphilis, at least verify with the doctor first (and in this case, both parents are too unmindful)!\n\nNew to the canon of Claude Chabrol, the pick of VIOLETTE may not be the optimum starter, the disrupted narrative never fully register any excitement barring a bitter aftertaste and shocking values of the subject matter, its foremost merit is to grant Huppert a stage to unleash her glacial pulchritude, which one can appreciate from every unyielding close-up on her, and comfortingly augurs an eminent career for her as crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of the French cinema, her screen magnetism is inherent.",

Gone is the military-focused, ship-bound storyline to be replaced by a generic &apos;government conspiracy&apos; style tale, with lots of driving around and chatting as a couple of protagonists evade the generic bad guys.\n\nThe special effects are very limited and consist merely of a couple of &apos;electricity&apos; effects which they really shouldn&apos;t have bothered with, as they&apos;re not very good. The hero duties are fulfilled by Nicholas Lea, who certain cult fans may remember playing Krychek in THE X-FILES, while the likes of Michael Pare and Malcolm McDowell prop up the cast. However, like a lot of low budget Canadian sci-fi movies in recent years, it&apos;s really not worth bothering with.",

      "reviewBody": "I must say that when I first saw Jump London I was a bit unsure about what exactly it was, but I was very interested. With Jump Britain I was sat at home, beer in hand and ready to see what would happen. I have to say that I was highly impressed. Unlike the first one, which was more targeted on the big moves and impressive moves, this one seemed to delve more into the philosophy and why they did what they did. I was also pleased to see that other members were joining in with Sebastian and his friend. I was a bit unsure when it was just the french, but when I saw people from the UK joining in I was tempted to give it a go myself.\n\nThe big shots in it were very impressive, the Stadium roof top had my heart in hand, and the walk across the bridge made my own fear of heights seem like a walk in the park. WHat impressed me the most was the street level moves they did. From my understanding of the documentary it was about fluid movement between the moves. It was gymnastic sort of stuff, but with a heavy Urban feel. I would have been put off if it wasn&apos;t for the fact that they guys who were doing it where far from your stereo typical thin gymnastic. These guys were either medium build or built like a boxer. It was great to watch and spurred me into trying to find more information about it.\n\nI found a site called urbanfreeflow.co.uk which has a huge community and un-beknown to me had over 7000 active members and also covered Europe and even as far around as the USA. I hooked up with some guys and girls from Birmingham and a week later I was at a jam (its what they call it) with 20 odd other people. I highly recommend the site and trying it yourself, it was bags of fun. Ache a little bit though.\n\nI personally felt that Jump London was made to show what parkour could do when you got really good at it, and that Jump Britain was a deeper look into why its done and by whom. It also opened my eyes to this new adventure called parkour and made me give it a go.\n\nAfter seeing this on channel four, I have since seen articles popping up all over the place, Addidas have just released a new trainer that is specifically for parkour, MTV had a segment on it, BBC news, ITV, FHM, all sorts really. From what I can gather its really hitting it big, and its mainly in the UK. They guys that run urbanfreeflow.co.uk where the actual people that were in the documentary. Its really scary to think that anybody can actually do what Sebastian makes look so easy, with enough practice.\n\nI highly recommend that people give it a go. ALso if you haven&apos;t seen it, I would suggest you try too. I found very entertaining while at the same time, it made me think very differently about how we move through the world today.\n\nMy final thought is that although some of the big shots in Jump Britain wern&apos;t as impressive as the ones in jump London, the low level street stuff made up for it ten fold. I would have actually preferred it have more street movement that the big shots. But all in all it was fantastic and highly enjoyable to watch. A big thumbs up."

      "name": "Harry Block: &quot;Six shrinks later, three wives down the line, and I still can&apos;t get my life together&quot;.",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1996) is Woody Allen&apos;s angriest, busiest, most neurotic, most complex, most personal with the funniest one-liners film that effortlessly moves from past to present, from reality to the world of imagination, and from funny bits to contemplation on serious and personal subjects so rapidly that you have to watch closely in order not to get lost in all these worlds. Allen plays Harry Block, a famous writer suffering from the writer&apos;s block and also from inability to survive in real world, to be happy and to make the people in his life happy, &quot;Six shrinks later, three wives down the line, and I still can&apos;t get my life together&quot;. Harry can&apos;t get his life together but he can write and he has put himself and all people he knows including his wives, friends, girl-friends, and his sister into his last novel. His art imitated life so closely that real people recognized themselves in the fictional characters very easily and now Harry lives through the nightmare of confronting near everybody he has ever known as well as the fictional characters, offended, infuriated, and insulted, who all rush in anger to face him: &quot;You have no values. With you it&apos;s all nihilism, cynicism, sarcasm, and orgasm.&quot; \n\nBy its structure,&quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; reminds the earlier film by one of Allen&apos;s favorite directors, Ingmar Bergman, &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;. As Professor Borg, Harry Block travels by car to upstate New York, where his college that expelled him as an undergraduate now wants to honor him as a world renowned belletrist. He travels by car with three unlikely companions, a hooker, a friend with bad heart, and his 9-years-old son whom he had kidnapped from school. As in &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;, Allen&apos;s film provides sincere, intelligent, and emotional contemplations of life&apos;s disappointment, regrets, and losses but at the same time, it is hilarious as only Allen&apos;s films can be. One of the best scenes of the film is Harry&apos;s descent on the elevator to air-conditioned Hell where in the ninth circle he meets the Devil who looks very much like Billy Crystal. Another wonderful scene concerns a married couple where after thirty years of happy uneventful marriage a wife learns some interesting eating habits from her husband&apos;s previous life. I can go on for long time. As often in the case of Allen&apos;s movies, with the modest running time of 96 minutes, &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; is expertly shot, boasts an amazing cast (Billy Crystal, Judy Davis, Bob Balaban, Elisabeth Shue, Demi Moore, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tobey Maguire, and Stanley Tucci just to name a few), and is in my opinion one of the most interesting and personal Allen&apos;s films.",

      "reviewBody": "During the World War I, in France, the middle-aged, bearded trader of furniture Henri-DesirÃ© Landru (Charles Denner) is married with four children. He spends a few time with his family since he has a secret life. He publishes advertisements looking for lonely wealthy women and seduces them with his politeness. Then he travels with them to a house in Gambais, where he kills them and burns them to the ashes in his stove. Then he returns home with money claiming that he earned in business trips. When he meets the beautiful Fernande Segret (StÃ©phane Audran), she becomes his mistress. He kills at least eleven women until the day the sister of one of his victims recognizes him. But the police need to find evidence but there is no body.\n\n&quot;Landru&quot; (1963), a.k.a. &quot;Bluebeard&quot; tells the true story of the French serial-killer Henri-DesirÃ© Landru, known as Bluebeard, by Claude Chabrol. The dark story is entwined with funny scenes to break the gruesome behavior of Landru. The part of his trial is too long and could be shorter. The cinematography is very beautiful as well as the actresses. It is another great film by Chabrol and worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Verdadeira HistÃ³ria do Barba Azul&quot; (&quot;The True Story of Bluebeard&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "This remains my favorite of Lynch&apos;s &quot;difficult&quot; films of the last decade, which include &quot;Lost Highway&quot; and &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; Absolutely no one can establish a mood of dread like Lynch, and this film is superlative in this respect. Images, sound design, and Sheryl Lee&apos;s near-miraculous performance all contribute to something much closer to a Horror Film than the genre with the actual namesake.\n\nIt seems that many fans of the Twin Peaks TV series were very disappointed with this film. I read over and over how &quot;peakies&quot; feel the movie lacks the &quot;quirky, off-beat, kinda funny&quot; tone of the TV series. Well, step back and consider something: the central themes of the movie AND the TV show are 1.) father-daughter incest, 2.) drug addiction, and 3.) murder. I guess we&apos;re all pretty desensitized, what with TV shows like &quot;Law and Order&quot; and Jerry Bruckheimer movies all purporting to give us action and thrills that are gritty and hard-bitten.\n\nLemme tell ya, that stuff ain&apos;t gritty and hard-bitten. Rape victims on TV shows are paper-thin stereotypes compared to the Laura Palmer of &quot;Fire Walk With Me.&quot; Why? Because Lynch shows us the HORROR, the inescapable, fenced-into-a-corner hysterical inevitableness of a young girl who can&apos;t cope with her father&apos;s abuse of her, who then turns to drugs and increasingly can&apos;t cope with those either, and who finally sees the true tragedy of her life before it&apos;s even finished playing out. The wings disappear from the picture.\n\nWhat &quot;Fire Walk&quot; offers in its portrait of evil and abuse is the full gamut of emotions, not just fear and anger (though there is plenty of that), but also aching, aching sadness, loneliness, abandonment. Lynch did a fairly good job of conveying this within the confines of a TV show with commercials (remember how the first half hour of the pilot was just people crying?), but in the movie he really gets to go town.\n\nIncest and drug abuse are absolutely devastating. This movie is absolutely devastating, and so touches the truth."

It was great to see Robert Englund again, he always does a great psycho. The movie was funny and gory ... sure the plot wasn&apos;t Oscar caliber, but anyone looking for that is going to the wrong movie. If you want to see a good horror movie, the real &apos;guts &amp; glory&apos; kind, this is the movie for you. I feel confident in recommending this movie and plan on picking up the DVD (especially since the version that was screened hasn&apos;t gone to the ratings board yet, so the DVD will probably be the only place to see this exact version).",

      "reviewBody": "With Love from Beirut: EuroSpy Adventures with Frederick Stafford\n\nRemembering the terrible explosion in August 2020, you cannot watch this film without a lump in your throat. Because here, too, the glamorous Beirut is to be reduced to rubble and ashes by a bomb. Richard Blake, the Interpol agent 505, is supposed to prevent this. The superhero is played by Frederick Stafford (1928-1979), who can only be seen here in his second film. The handsome businessman was discovered at his wedding party with Austrian film star Marianne Hold. No joke! In &quot;Topas&quot; the charmer was supposed to make it to the leading role of Hitchcock. Such an unexpected, picture-perfect career demands respect.\n\nFrom the moment he arrives in Lebanon, the Interpol agent is on guard and lets an unsuspecting tourist (Harald Leipnitz) act as a target for potential opponents. Together with Assi Bobby O&apos;Toole (Chris Howland) and the attractive photographer Denise (Genevieve Cluny), he tries to identify those behind the impending attack. A curious chambermaid (sexy and sassy: Renate Ewert), a shady Arab (Willy Birgel! Exactly him! The guy from &quot;Blaufuchs&quot; (1938) with Zarah Leander) and a lushly built nightclub siren (Gisella Arden) cross his path path marked by many fist fights. An Inspector Bernard (Pierre Richard) from the local police is also investigating the matter. In between, her lover goes to the Roman ruins of Baalbeck. After all, a bit of sightseeing is part of it!\n\nThe fun was produced by Wolf C. Hartwig (who of course also wanted to benefit from the EuroSpy wave of success) and the Italian producer Mario Siciliano.\n\nThis was to be the last film for the enchanting Renate Ewert (1933-1966). She was found dead by her friend Susanne Cramer in her Munich apartment.\n\nThis film is certainly not the most successful example of the EuroSpy wave. But it&apos;s definitely worth seeing because of the main actor, Frederick Stafford, and the beautiful shots of Beirut and the surrounding area. Passable entertainment is guaranteed!",

      "reviewBody": "Within the Pixar Dominated, Slapstick Permeated, Cookie-Cutter animated generation we currently live in, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga&apos;Hoole, Directed by Zack Snyder (&quot;300&quot; &amp; &quot;Watchmen&quot;), breaks this pedestrian mold through its Captivating Visuals, Engaging 3D, and its Lord of the Rings-like Odyssey.\n\nBased on a series of books written by Kathryn Lasky, this mythological story centers on dreamer Soren (Jim Sturgess), a young owl enamored with stories of &quot;The Guardians&quot;, a clan of warrior owls who hail from the Tree of Ga&apos;Hoole, and protect the weak from an evil army called the Pure Ones. When Soren and his brother, Kludd (Ryan Kwanten), are kidnapped by these Pure Ones, the stories become reality. Soren escapes and hunts for the Guardians to save the owl kingdom from the Pure Ones, while Kludd slowly becomes one.\n\nLegend of the Guardians is a milestone for animation and a 3D visual masterpiece. Under the direction of Snyder, Australian company Animal Logic (Creators of &quot;Happy Feet&quot; &amp; special FX for &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;) have achieved something incredibly remarkable. The interaction of air and digital feathers work in a harmony that makes Avatar look like an old computer game. The landscapes are absolutely breathtaking, Monsoons are shimmering and talons glistening, this brings out the best in Snyder&apos;s heavily artistic directing style, and has adorned this movie with graceful battle scenes, beautifully blended with his signature slow motion shots at the perfect moments.\n\nWith its comparisons to films like &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;, &quot;Watership Down&quot;, &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, with clear shades of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Guardians is not your run-of-the-mill animated movie with a fart joke every 10 seconds. The movie takes on a much more serious disposition which fits perfectly with its thematic flow. It is important to note, the film deals with issues such as courage, unity, loyalty, faith, sacrifice and betrayal tackled by Snyder with understated maturity. Though the story moves at a fairly quick pace, you will be immersed in what develops, as the writers did well to implement essentials to the storyline with comprehensible dialogue.\n\nWith that being said, Guardians is an engaging and relatively intense movie from start to finish. Thus, successfully separating our mindset of &quot;Animated&quot; and &quot;Kid Friendly&quot; being synonymous with each other. It is inspirational, breathtaking, humorous and educational with all the essentials of an all in all great story and movie. The kids and adults will both learn, while at the same time be visually enraptured by the animation&apos;s beauty. Don&apos;t be remotely surprised if you see sequels as it certainly has the legs to do so...or should I say wings (Note to self: Refrain from the bird puns..)",

      "reviewBody": "Bassam Al-Thawadi had made Bahrain&apos;s first feature film. The movie is his second effort after Hajiz, al- (1990) and this one is a production of Bahrain Cinema Company.\n\nThe movie stars Fatima Abdulrahim as Fatima, and she&apos;s trying her best to act here. Fatima has a vision hunting her for a long time. We get involved more and more with her while we get closer and closer to the story. The movie is about 87 min. which may be short but again it was maybe more than enough for the movie and the story to be told. Bassam Al-Thawadi&apos;s seems to be more of a nice storyteller than being a director. He wrote the story of the movie (as well as the script along with Fareed Ramadan) which is a good thing to have a movie written and directed by the same filmmaker.\n\nAli Al-Gurair plays the character of Ali, who is the ex-husband of Fatima and a work partner, as both works in the TV with the director Bassam Al-Thawadi giving a very nice cameo appearance as the boss of TV. Ali Al-Gurair was good as usual, funny as usual or maybe this time a little more above than that, and tried hard to stay in the character the whole time.\n\nAhmed Mubarak is a real highlight point in this movie, playing the character of Ahmed, as it shows he was the real supporting acting engine. He might have some over-the-top points, but along with the other performances, it made the movie so funny. You can&apos;t hold it not laughing at least few times during this movie, as my favorite joke involves the beautiful great actress Nicole Kidman!\n\nThe cast is very short to not mention, including some more cameos and few other actors like Ahmed Aqlan playing the character of Khalid, the brother of Ahmed. He gives a very average performance but his drug-addicted friend Ameen, played by Ameen Al-Sayiq, was an above average performance. I don&apos;t know enough about saving the best things for last, but that&apos;s what I&apos;m about to do. Juma&apos;an Al-Rowayai was the best performance in the movie. He&apos;s gifted and he proves it everytime he gets a chance lately.\n\nThe Cinematography was good in many ways, which Ahmed Al-Thawadi takes credit for, as it helped the movie to be more of a thriller. I definitely wished for better and costly cameras to give more to the movie, but that doesn&apos;t mean that this one was bad in anyway.\n\nWhat was the main center of many conversations is that this movie used Dolby sound technology which helped giving the atmosphere to the movie.\n\nThe movie&apos;s highest point is probably the score done by Nawaf Kamal, I guess, if I remembered the credits correctly. It was a bit short, and most of the time the director depended on the silence and special sound effects instead of the music to develop his thriller.\n\nVisitor (2004) means alot to every Bahraini. Maybe even so every Arabic filmmaker since it may give the green light for many other projects, or may mean more dieing hopes. I wouldn&apos;t like it much if compared to the best movies of the genre or the greatest movies of all time. But after all, this movie meant another positive step bringing us closer to our film dream, and that what it meant to me. So thank you Bassam Al-Thawadi.\n\n5/10",

After thinking a little about it, I believe the problem was the pace of the ending. I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow, and then the ending developed very fast. So, I would say the ending left me disappointed.\n\nI thought that the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! Also, the different relationships between the characters seemed very real. Furthermore,I thought that the different plot lines were well developed. Overall, it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it.\n\nIn conclusion: Good Characters, Great Plot, Poorly Written/Edited Ending. Still, Go See It!!!",

Universal ideas like friendship and loyalty are some of the themes. \n\nFinally a movie the whole family can watch without being afraid that there&apos;s something some kids shouldn&apos;t see.\n\nThough it the main part plays in Leibzig the inside of the boarding school was filmed in the &quot;Landesschule Pforta&quot;, a school which once was a monastery. The old bathroom they show is not in use anymore though... just as a secret way to get away from the teachers and visit people in other rooms...",

It was good to see Iron Maiden and Judas Priest contrasted to current bands such as Slipknot to show how the spirit of the genre is thriving. Tony Iommi, Dee Snider and Ronnie James Dio all give standout interviews with Dio&apos;s digs at Gene Simmons being especially revealing. It was also great to see &apos;80s curiosities Accept and Quebec&apos;s own Voivod being represented. The segment contrasting the grunting, leather-clad bands such as Man O War with the lace-wearing bands such as Poison and Cinderella was unexpected and fascinating. Showing the closeted Rob Halford performing in full cruising gear for a rabid hetero audience was quite poignant. I especially like how the film stresses how the music let its fans dream, cope and find solace. Those like myself, whose interest in metal may have flagged in the intervening years would do well to view it and remind themselves what all of the fuss was about.",

There are lots of drama movies out there whose theme seems to rust off compared to this one, and I proclaim to be heart-touched. Le Chiavi di Casa or also known as The keys to the house, had made the most authentic impact to our modern lives. The story runs with to main characters of Gianni (Kim Rossi Stuart) and Paolo (Andrea Rossi), whose relationship are embraced by new encounter of a father and son relationship. Gianni who haven&apos;t met his son since her wife died of giving birth to Paolo had found a chance to finally meet him. Paolo on the other hand who suffered a mildly intricate condition of being handicapped attempts to forge as well a connection with his father he never met before (and I never imagined that Andrea Rossi did really suffered a real life Muscular DystrophyÂwhich fitted him in the role, and thanks to the part of Gianni Amelio who earned and molded Andrea&apos;s confidence). The eloquence of the story showed the archetypal impact between a young father who haven&apos;t seen his son and tries to build unyielding relationship with a son by ways of bidding his entire life to the only family he gotÂPaolo.\n\nThough the original copy of this movie sold for an expensive rate of price in our place, I would really love to spend my time watching movie with explicit sincerity and magnificence. Le Chiavi de Casa had proved not only my money but as well my time and heart worthwhile.",

Seven long years that left too many scars.\n\nEvery now and then i will hear someone of my family talking about the suffer of those years although they rarely talk about what they&apos;ve been through.\n\nIndeed those who don&apos;t know, who are lucky (or not) enough to come from countries that never experienced that kind of horror will judge the movie based on script, lighting, acting etc. Those who know will feel the movie evoking all those feelings of deep sorrow and pain.\n\nMovies like this should always be made. It is another way to maintain memory of the fallen alive and to make sure that...never again (as the movie tells us in the end)",

      "reviewBody": "This coming-out story of 12-year-old Billy is set in rural New Zealand in 1975. Actually, it&apos;s more of a Bildungsroman, because it&apos;s no secret to anyone that Billy is gay. His family and friends accept him for who he is, but he&apos;s having problems at school.\n\nWe follow Billy as he shows us his home, family and childhood friends (mainly tomboy Lou) and his school life, where he is bullied and struggling with his dislike of rugby.\n\nWe follow him as he experiences his first relationship with fellow &quot;pufter&quot; Roy and his first crush on older and completely unobtainable Jamie (played by a sexy young Michael Dorman).\n\n&quot;50 Ways&quot; has an incredibly strong sense of time and place. I can&apos;t remember any movie that so successfully reconstructs the 1970s. The clothes, the haircuts, the town scenes, the homes -- it was all spot on. There was even a fondue dinner. Am I imagining it, but did the cinematography somehow reproduce the quality and texture of photographs from the 1970s? Movie goers are also treated to almost two hours of beautiful New Zealand landscape.\n\nMain seems to have directed this movie using a group of rural New Zealand children. The line between fiction and documentary is a thin one. The child actors in this movie appeared only in this movie and almost nowhere else. How often do you see real children acting out a graphic gay coming-of-age movie? How did Main accomplish this? I think this would have been unthinkable in puritan America, wouldn&apos;t it? For this reason alone, the film is remarkable.\n\nThe realism is astonishing. This is not a phony after-school special school. These are not American movie children. These are children without guile and sophistication, without internet, without MTV. Main shows us children and school life as they really were, with all its complexities, difficulties and awkwardness. Sure, the acting was occasionally amateurish, or the dialogue a little forced, but for the most part I felt like I was watching a real group of New Zealand children ca. 1975.\n\nAndrew Paterson, Harriet Beattie and Jay Collins -- I&apos;d like you to thank you for playing in this movie. You did a great job. Your characters will remain with me for a long time.\n\nI found the film to be moving, engrossing, relevant. I thought the movie had good character development and a few interesting plot twists. The complex and problematic relationship between soft Billy and tough Lou was the core of the movie. We outgrow our childhood friends as we discover ourselves.\n\nMain doesn&apos;t sugar coat what it&apos;s like to grow up gay. It&apos;s a rich and full look at every aspect. Billy&apos;s hopeless and awkward crush on Jamie felt true. I felt really sorry for hapless Roy. Billy&apos;s difficulties with Roy and Jamie reflect core relationship issues that reverberate throughout every gay man&apos;s life. The struggle with &quot;rugby&quot; (and what that represents) is also familiar. Adults play a very minor role in this movie. Isn&apos;t that also accurate for gay teenagers? What I particularly liked was the way that Main explored how we come to terms with those dreaded words (&quot;pufter&quot;, &quot;faggot&quot;, &quot;queer&quot;, or whatever). &quot;What does that really mean?&quot; And &quot;Yes, that is what I am.&quot; Dealing with those words is a big part of growing up.\n\nAt times the director introduces some whimsy, mostly based on the theme of Billy&apos;s imagined fantasies of a television show similar to Lost in Space. Billy identifies with Lana; Lou identifies with Brad. It&apos;s difficult to know what to make of such a deliberate and in-your-face use of cheese in a movie like this. I have to confess I was also into these shows when I was a kid. Or perhaps I have a high threshold for cheese. I think it&apos;s accurate to make a television show the centre of a boy&apos;s imagination in the 1970s.\n\nI see the movie has not got a strong score on IMDb. However, I wouldn&apos;t let this dissuade you from seeing it. Gay movies tend to get inexplicably and undeservedly low scores. Worth seeing!",

      "reviewBody": "Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but the obvious way to unscramble Szindbad is to think from a socialist perspective. When pre- socialist cultures are depicted in socialist cinema they are meant to look inferior to the society of present day. Szindbad is situated in the 20&apos;s Hungary, and shows us the pointless lifestyle of the upper class. Szindbad is a handsome and well- mannered dandy whose position in the society enables him to live his life without working.\n\nAs far as socialism is concerned Szindbad is a most extreme example of a bourgeois leach living on the blood of the people. Throughout the film Szindbad struggles to find meaning for his miserable life. He moves from one woman to another as if he was searching for something. Yet he understands the emptiness of his life which can be seen in his cynical attitude towards the women he makes love to. Apparently Szindbad has never loved.\n\nSzindbad is offered to the viewer as an example of the meaninglessness of life before the revolution. After, no one has to be unsure about their place in society. In the end Szindbad understands his life as a movement towards the ideal woman, which can, of course, never exist.\n\nAs a film, Szindbad is visually pretentious and slowly paced. I&apos;d like to think that some of it is due to the director reflecting the era and characters in his filmmaking. In any case it is slightly overlong. It is not a bad film, but a difficult viewing for us western viewers, mostly because the cinematic language differs from the (Hollywood) one we are used to."

Gopal (Deepak) loves Sapna, but the barriers of suspicion and fear are hard to break through. While the story is unusual and interesting, acting of the principals is good, direction, development of the plot is poor. Keeping a finger on the FAST FORWARD button is a good precaution for when you come to the bits that (1) have little to add to the storyline or (2) just a waste of time.

It&apos;s not long before discoveries are made, secrets are uncovered, and hell-on-Earth begins.\n\nSort of.\n\nThose accustomed to the Director&apos;s earlier work might find this movie a bit slow-building. It&apos;s suspenseful, but not in Fulci&apos;s usual, ultra-gory way. Oh, there are some bloody deaths, even decapitation, it&apos;s just not as continually visceral as his other films. DEMONIA&apos;s true mayhem is reserved for the finale.\n\nStill, the story is solid, and the characters are interesting, especially Liza (Meg Register) and Lilla (Carla Cassola), the town medium.

      "reviewBody": "Like Freddy Krueger, Micahel Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Chucky, Pinhead has become a pop culture icon the years. He first appeared in Clive Barker&apos;s novel &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot;, which was later turned into the 1987 hit movie HELLRAISER, which was written and directed by Barker. The success of HELLRAISER lead to three theatrical sequels, comics, and action figures. In the eighteen years since its release, the cult status HELLRAISER as grown bigger and bigger. Knowing they have an audience of die-hard Pinhead fans, executives at Dimension Films insist on cranking out a new direct-to-video sequel every few years. None of them are particularly any good, but I just like the legion of other Pinhead fans, watch them with the hope that one of the sequels with be as good as the original HELLRAISER. This year saw the release of two direct-to-video sequels. The first was HELLRAISER: DEADER, which was better than the average direct-to-video release, but still not nearly as good as HELLRAISER was. The second direct-to-video sequel featuring Pinhead to be released in 2005 is HELLRAISER: HELLWORLD, a film so lackluster that makes all the other direct-to-video Hellraiser sequels look like cinematic gold. &apos;HELLWORLD&apos; is yet another horror flick that seems to have been inspired by Wes Craven&apos;s NEW NIGHTMARE. However, while NEW NIGHTMARE was a clever and original horror picture, HELLRAISER: HELLWORLD is anything but. The premise seems dated and it is not nearly as clever as the filmmakers believe it is. The plot is just one of the many faults with this poorly edited, dreadfully acted, and misdirected failure. Like HELLRAISER: DEADER, &apos;HELLWORLD&apos; was long delayed and it&apos;s not hard to see why. It&apos;s sloppily put together and for something that is supposed to be a horror thriller, lacks tension altogether. On the plus side, the make-up and effects are decent, some gratuitous nudity is thrown in, and Lance Henrisken is good in his role. The best thing that can be said about it is that it is not quite as bad as HELLRAISER: BLOODLINE. With any luck, this will be the last Hellraiser sequel. If there is actually yet another sequel, hopefully Clive Barker will be involved. The franchise as lost its steam. It&apos;s time for Pinhead to finally die. My rating: 4/10"

Well instinct and a little knowledge can be a great thing. Both actors were great in this film. Set in Manchester and in area where social and community decline is evident. The story begins with a boy , like millions of British lads , playing football.\n\nFootball is the means in which he escapes from decay and bullying. A Man City fan in a school filled with Man Utd supporters.This is the hard luck kid of the ages. His mum is a single parent and he is not impressed with the new boyfriend.\n\nThe story is probably from a Scorcher cartoon , Billy&apos;s boots.The usual rivalry with a lad whose Dad is rich and uses his wealth and importance to further the prospects of his spoilt bully of a son who is Jimmy&apos;s chief tormenter and probably every boys nightmare at school, because he pulls the girls and is considered the best footballer in the school.\n\n The story is one of imagination and inspires belief. Misfortune and mistakes may hold people back , but in this film , it is that which makes the characters human. Achieving a dream which is against the odds (appearing at Man City) and finding love as well. Both Jimmy and Ma.\n\nThe musical score in the film was superb. Happy Mondays , The Charlatans and Stone Roses tracks keep the story and background flowing.\n\nThis was a great film , I even rate this film, better than Billy  Elliot. The acting ,  subject and the music made this film unforgetable. Sadly , I saw this film on video not on the big screen. Again the British Film Industry is let down in the marketing department.\n\nGreat film 10/10"

You might describe &quot;Lotna&quot; as his &apos;War Horse&apos; as it&apos;s about a great grey mare employed by the Polish Army during the Second World War. It&apos;s a visually impressive, (he shot it in a mixture of sepia and colour), near-epic account of men in battle with some scenes heavily influenced by Russian cinema, both from the period and from silent cinema. It may be no masterpiece but for some reason it&apos;s virtually been forgotten, a fate it definitely doesn&apos;t deserve. Four films in and Wajda was already proving to be a world-class director and there are moments here as fine as anything in his canon. Difficult to see now, it&apos;s worth making an effort to find.",

      "name": "Forgotten gem",
      "reviewBody": "Here we have the movie that Jean Renior considered his favorite of all his American efforts. It&apos;s truly a forgotten gem from this great director.\n\nIt involves the Tucker family, a hard-working but poor clan who toil in the cotton fields as day workers. The family is led by Sam, played by Zachary Scott, accompanied by his lovely wife Nona played by Betty Field. They are accompanied by Beulah Bondi&apos;s ornery Granny Tucker, two small children and a frisky little dog. They represent the best of America&apos;s hard-working poor, with Sam and Nona truly being dedicated to each other and their family.\n\nWe are introduced to them as they pluck cotton beneath the burning sun, hauling huge sacks stuffed with the crop. Suddenly an elder member of the family falters and he is quickly aided by his nephew and his wife, Sam and Nona. Sam takes his uncle&apos;s load of cotton, telling him that he&apos;ll finish his row. Nona Tucker stays with the old man as he languishes in the fields, flies buzzing around him as he sweats and wheezes. Sam soon rushes back after delivering his cotton, and Nona informs him that his uncle &quot;isn&apos;t doin&apos; too good.&quot; They give the old guy water, and urge him to hold on, but with his dying breath he tells his young relatives, &quot;...grow your own crop.&quot; This advice Sam truly takes to heart, and soon asks his sympathetic boss to let him farm a piece of land on a kind of rent-to-own deal. Sam and Nona&apos;s experiences making a life on this fallow piece of land are the focus of the movie.\n\nTruth be told, I&apos;ve always found talented Betty Field to be one of Hollywood&apos;s most unsung and under-appreciated actresses. She seems to generate some vague aura of tragedy, with subtle underpinnings of a quiet sexuality. Her voice has a low register, which also can have a beautiful clear resonance that is unique and memorable. Betty Field was the main reason I was so excited to finally be able to view &quot;The Southerner.&quot; And I certainly was not disappointed! Her Nona and Scott&apos;s Sam are extremely believable as soul mates and married lovers, and there is a certain erotic electricity in there quiet scenes together.\n\nZachary Scott&apos;character is earnest, sensitive and ultimately heroic, and his presence lends a quiet soft-spoken American spirit to the proceedings and he voices a soft Southern accent to perfection. His Sam Tucker is intelligent, brave, and determined, and the movie really gives him the opportunity to demonstrate his strength and prowess. Scott is wiry and strong, and his performance is athletic and inspiring. One can easily believe him to be the kind of man who would inspire the love and dedication of his wife and family. His obvious intelligence, goodness and his determination help make his long and difficult journey extremely involving. After a major catastrophe, when Sam experiences dark feelings of hopelessness, Zachary Scott truly conveys the reality of a common guy who questions all his decisions and abilities.\n\nJean Renoir&apos;s ability to capture the distinctly American essence of these characters is remarkable for a director from Europe. He certainly has a fascination and love for the land, and uses the landscape to reinforce the emotional high points of the film. In one remarkable scene, when the couple&apos;s young son battles an illness, Nona runs from the family&apos;s house into the freshly plowed field, crying as her husband follows her. She throws herself down onto the dirt and hugs the soil as she weeps, and confesses her innermost feelings. Renoir seems to almost turn the dirt and mud of this field into a third character in the scene.\n\nBut yes, there are a few elements in &quot;The Southerner&quot; that must disqualify it from masterpiece status. One disconcerting thing was the Hollywood makeup on Betty Field, who was never without mascara and lip gloss even when picking cotton or burning brush off a field. She certainly looked lovely, but also inappropriate for the movie. And the expert character actress Beulah Bondi has some moments where Renoir allowed her to perhaps play it a little too broadly. She&apos;s much of the comic relief in the film, and serves this purpose well, but her crotchetiness does begin to grate somewhat. And unfortunately the superb Blanche Yurka is underused as Sam&apos;s mother, and she appears so suddenly that it seems some of her scenes must have been cut. Percy Kilbride plays a thankless role as Yurka&apos;s suitor, and his screen time could have been used more efficiently.\n\nBut other supporting player deliver wonderful little turns in the film. There&apos;s Charles Kemper as Sam&apos;s rotund best friend and city slicker, Tim. He&apos;s likable and warm, and the narration that opens the film is his. He is perhaps the polar opposite of Sam in appearance and philosophy, and lends a voice to the advantages of city living. Then we have J. Carroll Naish as a terse and bitter neighbor who supplies much dramatic impact in his scenes with good guy Sam. The deliberate and thoughtful interplay between these two characters is packed with tension and foreboding. Norman Lloyd as Naish&apos;s nasty lowlife farmhand gives a unique performance and seems to bring an almost animalistic quality to his character. Also Dorothy Granger is both frightening and sad as a drunken barroom floozy who doesn&apos;t run from a fight.\n\n&quot;The Southerner&quot; could probably be considered &quot;The Grapes of Wrath, Lite.&quot; But to view it that way certainly underestimates its own power, and its relevance even today. Stripped to its essence, the movie could be the tale of any close-knit family who struggles to survive and to flourish in an uncaring world. Renior&apos;s talent, with the help of a great cast, makes &quot;The Southerner&quot; an impressive portrait of the struggles and rewards of American farm life. It has the ability to resonate in the memory because of both its Hollywood artistry and its gritty Southern strength."

Like in a thesis, he exposes his point of view based in his study of the theme along the time. The reconstitution of the witches in the Middle Ages is amazing. The last part with the comparison with the hysteric women is funny in 2010, but it was the reality in 1921. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;HÃ¤xan - A FeitiÃ§aria AtravÃ©s dos Tempos&quot; (&quot;HÃ¤xan - The Witchcraft Through the Time&quot;)\n\nNote: On 16 Aug 2018 I saw this film again.",

      "reviewBody": "The plot: A man seeking to resurrect his dead lover runs into a shady occultist who claims to be able to help him.\n\nNecromentia is clearly one huge homage toward the works of Clive Barker -- Hellraiser, in particular. As a huge Barker fan, I was both excited and a little disappointed. The film is grotesque, gory, and beautiful, but almost everything in it is directly &quot;inspired&quot; by Clive Barker, making it a bit less original than I might like. Still, it has some truly striking visuals, and some scenes that you might remember long after the movie ends.\n\nNecromentia is slow-paced and atmospheric, and people who are more used to modern, MTV-style filmmaking might end up being bored. The budget is clearly very low, but I thought they did an excellent job with what they had. Sure, some of the set design was a little underwhelming at times, but I was not nearly as disappointed as many other people seem to have been. There are many twisted and disturbing scenes, some of which end up with a very absurd, surreal vibe. Although not really a candidate for &quot;most disturbing movie ever&quot;, it still deserves an honorable mention.\n\nThere some original ideas here, but the themes are as old as dirt, and, admittedly, becoming a bit clichÃ©d in horror movies. If you&apos;re looking for something more than a Hellraiser clone, I can understand how you&apos;d dislike this movie. Despite its issues, I still enjoyed it, and I think that other Barker fans may, as well.",

Keith Richards is especially cool during this era, and many would agree that the band is pretty much at their peak here. Great rock and roll music, originally released in quadrophonic sound.  Recorded live in Texas, with all on-stage footage and no backstage or interview shots whatsoever. The biggest problem is that you CAN&apos;T BUY THE THING!!!  Why has this never been released officially on VHS?  Where&apos;s a new remastered DVD?  Most likely Allen Klein is to blame somehow for this great footage not being (legitimately) available, but let&apos;s hope that someday we can actually go buy an official release of this classic.  Stones fans HAVE to see this thing, but casual fans may want to stick with &quot;Gimme Shelter,&quot; which you can at least go buy/rent.",

      "reviewBody": "At a time when horror films constitute silly teenagers blindly wandering into danger and unnecessary gore, &apos;The Others&apos; is like a breath of fresh air. It goes back to the roots of the horror genre, employing an eerie atmosphere and mysterious characters to conjure the chilly backbone of the film.\n\n&apos;The Others&apos; is set in the Forties and revolves around staunchly Catholic Grace Stewart, who lives in an old mansion located on the island of Jersey with her highly photo-sensitive children ten-year-old Anne and six-year-old Nicholas. The house is almost permanently entrenched in darkness, in deference to the children&apos;s condition, and Grace&apos;s husband is lost in war, only enhancing the sense of gloom to the story. One morning, three servants mysteriously turn up at the door of the Stewart mansion, despite Grace having not yet advertised the posts, to replace the previous servants who had suddenly left their posts a week earlier. Anne then begins to maintain the house is haunted, her deduction supported by the fact locked doors left ajar, closed curtains suddenly being found opened and furniture moving when there&apos;s no-one in the room. Grace, deeply ingrained in her religious belief that ghosts don&apos;t exist, initially refuses to believe her daughter but soon she questions her faith as she can&apos;t deny there is something ominous about the house...\n\nNicole Kidman gives an excellent performance as the almost cold and aloof Grace, who does love her children dearly even if she doesn&apos;t always show it openly. Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy, as the three servants, are suitably mysterious by showing they seem to know more than they let on, leaving viewers questioning their motives from the start. But it is the young child actors, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, who steal the show as Anne and Nicholas. Despite their age and inexperience, both children given first-class depictions of their characters, showing their isolation thanks to their medical conditions and their reliance on one another despite typical sibling discord at times. Mann, in particular, excels in portraying the stubborn nature of Anne and her precarious relationship with her mother. It is a shame this child never continued her acting career because she is a credit to young British acting.\n\n&apos;The Others&apos; is a subtle horror films for those sick of cheap Hollywood horror flicks and are seeking interesting characters and an intelligent plot. While there are no special effects or buckets of blood in this film, in the tradition of &apos;The Exorcist&apos; and &apos;The Devil&apos;s Backbone&apos;, it instead relies upon more old-fashion methods of frightening the audience, which are far more effective. The story is well-paced, leaving the audience guessing what is happening and what the characters&apos; motives are right to the end.\n\nThis film has to be one of the best horror films I&apos;ve ever seen and puts many films in the horror genre to shame. I highly recommend it to those who appreciate the value of suspense and a good fright.",

So many facets are perfect: Loy at her peak of gorgeous, wry sophistication; the Deco sets; Powell&apos;s gentle irony; the relationships of various characters and the consistency of dialog; even the physical pranks were great--and I don&apos;t like slapstick all that much! This film reminded me of Shop Around the Corner. It wasn&apos;t as good, that&apos;s a tall order, but there was something bigger going on in this movie than just the usual romantic farce. I have to admire the writer&apos;s and director&apos;s ability to pull off a romantic comedy between two such diametrically opposed people. The heroine is the quintessential control freak; the hero, as laid back and tolerant as a hippie of the sixties. No one apologizes for their quirks, which is refreshing, and neither of them had to change all that much to make the ending work. And as far as acting goes, Loy and Powell don&apos;t hold back any punches (literally!) whenever the two characters collide. It is amazing to watch them knowing how they were reacting to Harlow&apos;s death during shooting. I love finding old movies, and this one is buried treasure.",

A $32,000,000 chase turns into the American thriller of the year! .There are no rules and no holds barred when Popeye cuts loose!\n\nIn this highly rated film there is noisy action , suspense , thrills , violence and being extremely entertaining . Gene Hackman as the rebel and non-conformist Popeye is magnificent , he won a deserved Academy Award . His nemesis , Fernando Rey as the drug smuggler , plays perfectly his role as the cunning and elegant villain . Furthermore , a splendid support cast , such as : Roy Scheider , Tony LoBianco , Marcel Bozuffi , among others . The movie contains one of the best car chases ever shot with another prize for the professional film editor (Greenberg) and one of the most gripping pursuits between Popeye Doyle and Alain Charnier. Aproppiate and realistic cinematography by Owen Roizman , Friedkin&apos;s usual cameraman (The Exorcist) and adequate music score by Don Ellis . Interesting screenplay by Ernest Tidyman , an expert writer on thrillers and action movies (Shaft) . This is a great film , professionally directed by William Friedkin and followed by a nice sequel Â¨French Connection IIÂ¨ by John Frankenheimer and again with Gene Hackman and Fernando Rey. Rating : Above average and well worth seeing , as it is an authentic classic movie .",

He works at a golf course and looks for advice from the regular members. Meanwhile a rivalry is developing between a new member of the golf club and a prideful legacy member. The kid is about to be caught in the middle of the rivalry.\n\nThis movie is directed by Harold Ramis (National Lampoon&apos;s Vacation) in his directorial debut and stars Chevy Chase (Three Amigos), Rodney Dangerfield (Back to School), Bill Murray (Stripes), Ted Knight (The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Brian Doyle-Murray (National Lampoon&apos;s Christmas Vacation).\n\nThis is easily the greatest golf movie ever created. It contains a fun storyline, unique characters and randomly fun circumstances. The movie is perfectly cast and Murray, Chase and Dangerfield are brilliant. Every scene with the gopher and Murray is legendary and Chase&apos;s dry humor is perfect. The soundtrack is also magnificent.\n\nOverall this is a classic 80s gem in every way - look, feel, cast and content. There&apos;s nothing to not like about this picture. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",

Some time is spent showing the medical section working on wounded soldiers, as well as the treatment of German prisoners, and even a few moments of battlefield casualties.\n\nHistorically, this film is priceless, a glimpse at the Great War while it was still in full swing, and a treasure trove for history buffs and military enthusiasts. This was released one month into the battle, which would continue for another 3 months. Although rather arbitrarily divided into 5 chapters, there&apos;s no narrative,per say, and will be of little interest to most viewers. However, it is listed as one of the 101 War Movies to See Before You Die.",

      "reviewBody": "An academic returns from abroad to join others in celebrating their mentor&apos;s retirement. But after he&apos;s interviewed on television, he&apos;s found in his hotel room, having apparently committed suicide. The old professor&apos;s retirement party continues nonetheless, amidst songs, pyrotechnics, harassing helicopters, circus performers, random violence, TV monitors, naked women, and fragmentary philosophical arguments.\n\nIt&apos;s always hard to know with Miklos Jancso just how much meaning is lost on non-Hungarian audiences, but sometimes the ideas are universal enough and/or the camera choreography is riveting enough to transcend that. Here...not so much. As usual, there is definitely visual stimulus in the long, elaborate shots weaving through actors and actions that don&apos;t seem to have much purpose beyond being part of that photographed pageantry. The plot, such as it is, is a sort of murder mystery that escalates into full-scale carnage. Yet this too feels like a pretense for the stylistic acrobatics, particularly since Jesus himself (played by none other than a late-arriving Bela Tarr) is able to &quot;resurrect&quot; all the fallen victims without much effort.\n\nAs to just what all this meant as political metaphor in 1987 Hungary, it beats me. Perhaps the near-farcical chaos is representative of a state system that was on the verge of collapse, whether it knew it or not, though that or any other interpretation is somewhat weakened by the banality of the way in which comely young women (but never men) only seem to be here to shed their clothes-not so unlike a drive-in sexploitation movie, a genre that this director otherwise has absolutely nothing in common with. Jancso is never without interest, but I can&apos;t say this is the movie that would make a convert out of you, or would provide a good place to start with him.",

      "reviewBody": "The entire movie, an artful adaptation of one of Joyce&apos;s &quot;Dubliners&quot; stories, takes place on the night of January 6 (Epiphany), 1906. Most of the film takes place at an annual party given by three spinsters (two sisters and their niece), where a group of upper-class Dubliners gather for an evening of music, recitations and dinner. While there is very little plot per se, the interaction and conversation among the group reveals much about Dublin in the early 20th century when the stirrings for independence were just beginning. The cast, all talented Irish stage actors with the exception of Anjelica Huston, are universally wonderful, and one actually feels he is a guest at the gathering himself. The poignant final scene, between Ms. Huston and the amazing Donal McCann, reveals much about the marriage of the characters. There is poignancy mixed with humor and insight, and for those who like quiet, thoughtful movies, &quot;The Dead&quot; is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we make a ritual of watching this wonderful movie every January 6th. After many viewings it never fails to move me, and each time I glean something that I&apos;ve missed before.",

      "reviewBody": "The title translates into &quot;the great temptation&quot;, but do not be tempted to watch this ridiculous doctor&apos;s drama. It is about a student of medicine who practises as surgeon. While at first it is already not clear why he does this at all (Dieter Borsche has such an innocent face), later it is not clear why his conscience bothers him. Could it be that Borsche was starting to be aware of the silliness of the drama out of which the only way to get out was to give himself up? If so why did not he report the writer and the director as well for bad taste? Did I ever see so much honour on celluloid?\n\n Not only for content the film is unbearable, it is poorly written and directed too. The problems in the other sanatorium are never solved; we only hear Paul Bildt saying that he has been going through the same procedure (court trial). The story moves from A to B to C and back again, without any structure. An extremely bad scene is the scene in which during a party doctor Borsche first has trouble with his conscience (was it the liquour perhaps?); this should have been the dramatic turn, but it is badly directed and edited as if the editor was doing open heart surgery.\n\nMy conscience was bothering me for having to endure this film against which no anaesthesia will help.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie serves as a precursor to Sammo Hungs Iron-fisted Monk, with the great kicker Casanova Wong in a similar role as a shaolin monk-kicker extraordinaire. Sammos mentor Huang Feng is the director, who was responsible for some early classics such as HAPKIDO and WHEN TAEKWONDO STRIKES, both starring the ultimate high kicking femme fatale Angela Mao and both featuring and choreographed by Sammo.\n\nThe plot concerns the lead villain Chen Sing (dubbed the Charles Bronson of Asia) scouring the country for various martial arts manuals to further his evil deeds. James Tien is the student of Wu Tang who trains to stop him. there are many plot twists along the way which I wont go in to.\n\nThe movie starts brilliantly and excitingly with Sammo in full on villain mode sporting a beard and some killer weaponry, searching out the good guys. Two excellently choreographed fights follow, with Kam Kong displaying superb bootwork and Chien Yuet San some intricate spearplay. The choreography here is up there with Sammos later, masterful work such as MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER and ODD COUPLE. However, as the plot takes over there are some long, boring passages. But just wait until the ending! Casanova Wong kicks into gear alongside none other than Kwon Young Moon, as the two take on numerous villains and finally Chen Sing. Seeing these two go into action alongside each other is a joy to behold, not just for the fans.\n\nCasanova is known for his more high profile roles in movies like WARRIORS TWO, in which he performs one of the most incredible kicks ever seen on screen. But here his abilities are in my opinion given the best showcase. In one shot he performs 7 kicks, lightning fast, without his foot touching the floor, with excellent technique! It has to be seen to be believed. James Tien also performs the best action I&apos;ve seen from him, having a good weapons duel with Chen.\n\nThe production values are decent, what you would expect of a Golden Harvest film from this time, and there is good use of locations. Sammo has one of his best villainous roles, as does Chen. If you are a fan of any of the performers this is a must-see, as the action is definitely up there with the best of the 70s kung fu movies.\n\nThe Hong Kong DVD has excellent cover art, but unfortunately the print ain&apos;t that good. At least its subtitled with a letterboxed presentation. Get it Yo!",

This is a lot better then Nosferatu (1979). That is one awful Dracula movie. This is a Dracula sequel. There are a lot of Dracula sequels. And most of then a great film. This is one that is great.

There was plenty of potential conflict in the opening scene but outside of that I soon lost interest in her character and the other characters she met along with way.

The actors are doing their best here with a subpar script. It was great to see Uma with her crew. That remix on her song was really fun. She barely has anything to do here. Cinderella and Pronce Charming we also wonderful to see together, even though it was extra lovey lovey. I also enjoyed their teenage counterparts.\n\nHonestly, I could see a version of this story working with these same actors. They just needed a better script!",

      "reviewBody": "I eventually tracked down this movie only after I had read RenÃ© Fallet&apos;s original and colourful novel. My main prejudice was always about Jean Lefebvre in the lead: he was never a good actor, only funny on the very narrow range of a weeping loser background character - supporting character actually demands real acting skills.\n\nI was also curious about Un Idiot Ã  Paris after watching some delightfully worded scenes posted on YouTube, or edited into that excellent documentary about the great dialogue writer, Michel Audiard et le MystÃ¨re du Triangle des Bermudes. Yes Dany Carel and Bernard Blier shine in a couple of Audiard trademark rants. Yves Robert is great also in another scene, but this one was actually in the book and is only a rare example of a fine adaptation work in the movie.\n\nIndeed these Audiard rants are simply out of pace in an already badly paced adaptation. The first few scenes, actually a narration disjointed in vignettes, introducing Goubi before he goes to Paris, are just a total failure. They miss the point of setting the countryside reference to the journey. Ironically Yves Robert is around for a couple of minutes as I mentioned, and he did know how to shoot the countryside to express what makes people free and happy there. As such the movie starts off with the ideas that countrymen are restless thick people whereas the point of the story is showing a poor naive character lost in the frantic Parisian merry-go-round.\n\nSerge Korber was never a good director either, and yet he was handed material with potential, starting with this movie and ending with vehicles for top stars de FunÃ¨s and Girardot - which bombed, prompting a somewhat disillusioned porn stint. The young director&apos;s assignment excuse doesn&apos;t stick since his name is listed as a writer too. A good example of a poor director&apos;s job is how Korber directed AndrÃ© Pousse in his debut as a rude cab driver. Audiard had chiselled a fine rant for his friend, the monologue is funny, but Pousse is simply given too little direction to make this look good.\n\nAbove all most of the harm comes from casting Jean Lefebvre as the lead. Whoever pushed the idea forward simply didn&apos;t understand that playing a dumb character requires a very talented actor (think Rain Man, Forrest Gump), not just one that already looks dumb. Bourvil comes to mind here but he was certainly too expensive. Fernandel was too old but the part here is not too dissimilar to the one he had in Le Schpountz - an obvious reference in the novel when Parisians on holiday talk Goubi into believing he would be a sensation at the Olympia concert hall.\n\nIt is difficult to recommend this movie. You can enjoy the best parts elsewhere, yet these Audiard tidbits do little if anything to lift the movie out of its utter mediocrity. To see Bernard Blier, Dany Carel wasted in this missed opportunity is really painful as the story hops along with other fine supporting characters including Yves Robert, Jean Carmet, AndrÃ© Pousse and Pierre Richard.",

Granted the title is really quite naff, the story is rather standard and didn&apos;t particularly surprise me and while I admired its ambition the dialogue is often quite weak and stilted. However, I liked Witchville. The production values are surprisingly not too bad for a low-budget movie, the sets and costumes look as though they were constructed with care, the scenery is beautiful and the effects are more consistent and less crude, the standout being the hellhound attack which did have me biting my nails. The sword-fighting scenes are efficiently done and nicely choreographed, the direction is competent and I too loved Jozefa&apos;s stylish entrances. The music is pretty tolerable too, while the acting while far from award-worthy is decent, especially MyAnna Buring. All in all, despite its weaknesses for me it is one of the better Syfy movies. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all Indian films - Pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps commonly associated with Bollywood film (ie tackiness, farce, wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western film themes/genres).  Pakeezah is indigenous to the Sub-Continent and authentic, almost Madam Butterfly-like in plot.  Characters are well-developed, direction, although sometimes unrefined by today&apos;s standards, perceptive and convincing.  The Urdu-speaking milieux at the time of Pakeezah were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age! The acting (particularly the &apos;looks&apos; and the dynamic between characters) are a delight to behold although the nuances may be lost on contemporary viewers or those not acquainted with the mores and customs of Muslim India.\n\nCoupled, with a captivating screenplay is a beautiful musical score, enhanced by the protagonist displaying eminent command of classical Indian dance (kathak).  As is the case with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she does not take her leave of the audience without the viewer feeling he/she has been party to a truly memorable cinema experience. Pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled.",

      "reviewBody": "There is SO much going on in this film, but it has rhythm, pace, a great soundtrack, and enjoyable, charismatic performances, that kept me engaged from the word go. The editing owes something to 60s Godard - lots of jump cuts in the dialogue scenes - and 80s Rohmer - anguished 30 somethings worrying about true love - and possibly, in its tour de force final sequence, a reference to La Jetee, which is also of course about memory, fate, and mortality. And then there is the rather bizarre Audrey reference which opens the film: as Nora steps out of a black car, clutching her morning coffee, clothed in black, her hair wound up on her head, the strains of Monn River sound. So far, so post-modern. This is is a film that is freighted with filmic, literary, theatrical (esp Shakespeare and the Tempest) and artistic allusions, but that uses these in service of a specific point: that these cultural references and allusions make the web of our being - that art is how we communicate to each other (notice that all the characters communicate through art - the gift Nora gives her father, the music Ismael dances to, the book the father writes - even the &apos;murder scene&apos; is filmed through a highly stylised mise-en-scene): that &apos;artifice&apos; can reveal the deepest and most moving of human emotions. It is a beautiful film that will move you and make you leave the cinema feeling transported. And Deneuve is just great! I love the bit where Ismael asks her if anyone has ever told her she&apos;s beautiful, and she gives a slight twist of her lips, sighs, and says, yes, she has heard that before. Just because something has become clichÃ©, doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not true.",

The film is one of Soviet cinema&apos;s first forays into the World War II spy thriller, which was to reach its climax with the &quot;17 Moments of Spring&quot; miniseries made in 1973.\n\nThe film is fairly typical of the Stalin era war films, with a a slight cartoonish aspect to the characters, but pleasantly there is lack of blatant communist/Stalinist propaganda.\n\nThe director, Barnet (who plays a Nazi general in the film), favors static wide shots which do not always translate well on television, especially if you are watching a mediocre transfer from an old print. The performances are pretty good, particularly Kadochnikov&apos;s. The plot does keep you on the edge although the end is a bit rushed, it almost feels as if Stalin commanded the editor to shorten the end by 50%.\n\nOverall the film is enjoyable for those who like old war flicks.",

The milieu is the porn movie business which Schneider&apos;s character works in, interwoven with the classical theatre world she would like to belong to.\n\nRomy Schneider got the Cesar award for her performance here; she pulls out all the stops to create this gifted but battered-by-life character. Pity that Zulawski couldn&apos;t craft a more balanced film around her."

However, I am being picky for there are enough stimulating lines of dialogue and provocative visuals to keep things moving and we have the two stars, on top form, as well. Fernando Rey is at his impish best, and if at times we are not too sure what is going on, he never seems to have any such doubts. At once creepy, half crazed and completely mad he slides, bounds and crashes throughout his many scenes. And Catherine, seven years after her amazing performance in Mr Bunuel senior&apos;s classic, Belle de Jour, she is back again giving her all for his son. She does wear red boots a lot of the time but I saw nothing significant in this to warrant the title but she looks lovely in them. In truth she looks lovely without them too and with and without all her clothes. Well worth a watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Honestly, this film gets a little more hate than it deserves. However, that only means this is a solid 3/10, not a 1/10. It has some really great shots and an interesting premise. That&apos;s all this film has going for it.\n\nThis thing is an absolute mess, and it is honestly only worth watching to see how bad Bergman&apos;s worst movie is. After about ten minutes of watching this hollow attempt at a Hollywood-style message film, you can see why the great auteur disowned it completely. If Bergman hadn&apos;t made this, it&apos;d be so easily and correctly forgotten. People give his &quot;Crisis&quot; a lot of flack, but this truly is the worst thing he ever directed.\n\nThe action sequences consist mostly of physics-defying car chases, nonsense grappling and gunfights that make Stormtroopers look like marksmen. The dialogue stops making any sense quickly and the message is some vague nonsense about some weird KGB/gestapo hybrid spy organization hunting down a refugee over a McGuffin. As much as the first half is watchable (if contrived), the second half of this movie will have you begging for it to just end. The plot utterly falls away and the final sequences on the boat in harbor are some of the worst in film history.\n\nI never would have watched it if I weren&apos;t a Bergman completionist. And even if you are too, save yourself from this total waste of time. It&apos;s no Manos or Plan 9, but it is absolutely worse than almost any real studio film of the time period.",

      "reviewBody": "The documentary genre is renowned for its creative filmic style and original brilliance the creators of said films bring to the screen.  In the case of BODYSONG writer/director Simon Pummell in his debut feature is left to delve deep into the realms of his mind where anything and everything is possible. Pummell brings his ferociously honest film to life via the avenue of Jonny Greenwood, from the band &apos;Radiohead&apos;, with his immense musical genius creating a score worthy of the greatest motion picture.\n\nThe addresses the common truths throughout all society and more importantly the human race as the name suggests BODY being the overriding theme of the feature.  All aspects of life are addressed and recorded vividly with no image censored leaving the spectator with a true sense of wonder and horror about the characteristics of the species depicted on screen.  The shear volume of information and constant moving images of &apos;us&apos; becomes a wanted tedium.  Repetition seems to have no grounds when up against some of the most beautiful events that can ever occur for example the explicitly shown growing and birth of a human child and the resultant joy of the given parents.  Only the most hardened soul could create disgust when viewing such magnificent beauty. One is truly in love with the idea of the human race and thus finds oneself deeply devoted to such a picture.  Common curiosity is above all the true reason for placing yourself into the realms of Pummells&apos; mind. This curiosity is convulsed with images that at the same time will deeply sicken most but also when realised as an entirety or as a &apos;human&apos; they become less horrifying and more of a pragmatically true representation of the human species as we knew and know it.  With all metaphorically decorative elements removed this film is showing you nothing more than human life, love, sex, death but in a way which truly mesmerises the soul.  Whilst showing the spectator the standard characteristics of the human species Pummell chooses to show feats of human brilliance from the ignition of paper with pure mental strength to the hilariously exquisite contorting gymnastics of a man and his dog.  Everything amazes solely because of the blatant and uncensored truth that is filmed. One cannot find in him a reason to criticise this feature due to its pure brilliance from the filmic techniques to the excellent score but more criticisms of the human race.  You may find yourself in total emotional disarray that one human can do such things to another, but the film is &apos;us&apos; and if we are like this then we must not blame the film for its grotesque frankness.  More importantly blame us for giving Pummell the resources and the imagery to work with when creating the picture. The character in this film is humans not one but all and the people playing the species do it with realism and fortitude.  Actors unconsciously playing a role that are generic to them, i.e. humans doing what they do best, being human.  All the characters in the film have a story they are real people and what makes BODYSONG so unique is that an Internet database was created alongside the film with the background of all the people shown in the feature. One is left with only a few words to persuade others to watch BODYSONG them being, IF YOU ARE HUMAN WATCH THIS FILM.",

      "reviewBody": "I was skeptical of this movie and did not plan on seeing it in a cinema, but then when the opportunity to view it in a small local theatre arose, I went for it. The advantage of the local theater that is in walking distance is that you can drink alcohol during the viewing. I managed 3 lagers and sadly that was not enough.\n\nTo be completely honest, there are things to like about this movie. Some of the jokes worked. The costumes, locations, effects and overall production value is very good. Ceasar and Cleopatra were fun to watch and carry the movie IMO. Why the bad rating you ask? I am sorry, but I cannot give any more points to a movie called Asterix &amp; Obelix which gets the main character so completely wrong. It is a fundamental flaw that I can&apos;t get past. Asterix is supposed to be a smart, funny and likeable character. What have we got in this movie? He doesn&apos;t want to eat meat (but does anyway) and doesn&apos;t want to rely on the magic potion (but does anyway). The Magic potion side of things could have been a setup to showcase his wit and have him outsmart his oponents, such plotlines were done before but no, he just takes the potion as a hypocrite and carries on. Oh and there is a pointless loveinterest subplot. Imagine seeing this movie as your first encounter with Asterix and Obelix, which it for many kids probably is. The character onscreen is a nonagreable pretentios whiny hypocrite. Why anyone would want to watch any movies with THIS charater is baffling.\n\nSo much money spent on this movie and they couldn&apos;t afford anyone to write a decent script? It becomes more frustrating when you compare it to the last Animated movie, the secret of the magic potion. If you go one step beyond that, you get the excellent Mansion of the Gods movie, which means that there still are people who can write an engaging Asterix story out there.\n\nThis movie actually does more harm than it would if it were not made at all. If it does well at the box office, more such trash will be made. If it does poorly at the box office, the producers will think that the IP is dead and it can hinder any further Asterix movies ever being made. If future movies are to be made in the same spirit I guess the lesser evil would be not to have any more movies.\n\nIf you are a fan, then avoid this movie. If you are not, I can&apos;t see how this movie would turn you into one. Just forget it.",

If at the video store you see a box with a creepy looking scarecrow holding a sickle and you read the back of the box, don&apos;t expect a masterpiece.\n\nI am a rabid horror fan...always have been. And yes, I tend you beat the hell out of most of them when I review them. Hell, I write these kinds of films (see TOWER OF BLOOD - that&apos;s one of mine). However, I appreciate the time and effort that is put into making these types of movies.\n\nSCARECROW is by far and large a bad movie. Laughable script, 1-dimensional plastic characters, poor &amp; sloppy direction...this one has it all.\n\nWhat saves this movie? The photography! The DP (director of photography) does an excellent job shooting this movie. Several angles and at times how the scarecrow is shot are really creepy. Kudos to him! Also, the editing ain&apos;t half bad either! What I did not like, besides the direction and plot, is the scarecrow! To me, horror films should not be comedic! That isn&apos;t&apos; to say that you can&apos;t have a good Comedy/Horror flick! Trust me, I&apos;ve been plenty - but done much better than this. That is, however not to say this was purely a Comedy/Horror...I think the director was trying to make a straight horror film. Did he fail miserably. The wise-cracking, somersaulting, gymnastics crap was ridiculous!!! With most movies like this, there was so much potential that was lost because of directors such as the one behind this mess. If you watch the making-of on the DVD, you will hear the director name-drop like there ain&apos;t no tomorrow. He says he draws his inspiration from some of the greats in horror history (Wes Craven, John Carpenter, etc.) and Dario Argento....wait, what? Yup, he even dedicated this film the the Italian Horror Legend! I wonder how Mr. Argento would feel about this? Now, Mr. Argento is on my list of all time greats, but I don&apos;t see the connection to his films to this one. Oh well! While the director is busy dropping these names, no where does he explain how they inspire him. Nor does he cite references to these greats filmmakers and what about them inspired him.\n\nOverall, a down-right piece of schlock which should not be taken seriously. Just enjoy some of the inventive death scene and gore! Don&apos;t walk away being upset cause you wasted your time...You knew what you were getting in to when you rented it!",

      "reviewBody": "I depise comedies, especially French comedies - I am French - except old Louis De FunÃ¨s, Bourvil and Fernandel films - and I hate those stupid movies where I need some one to tell me when to laugh.... But those 0SS 117 features starring Jean Dujardin, there are three of them so far- I LOVE IT. And I was at first very reluctant to imagine OSS 117 as comedies. You see, I saw the genuine OSS 117 when I was a kid, starring Frederic Stafford, which were not comedies at all. So I was afraid to watch those; but what a surprise after the first time I saw them. Here the peculiarity is not the story of course, it is so stupid, but that&apos;s precisely the purpose of this masterpiece. To, FOR ONCE, the film presents a hero who is very handsome, the most handsome man on earth, womanizer, great fighter, so elegant, but AND THAT IS ALSO THE EXQUISITE CONTRAST, a guy totally racist, sexist, childish, pretentious, antisemitic, without any education nor culture, idiot at a scale you can&apos;t even imagine. I could not stop laughing during the time I saw those movies. Jean Dujardin reminds Jean Paul Belmondo, for instance in LE MAGNIFIQUE, but Belmondo&apos;s character was less idiotic, or also Dean Martin in MATT HELM films. Anyway it is absolutely impossible to show a more dumb character on screen. Just enjoy this wonderful tribute to the sixties espionnage films period and more precisely the MATT HELM and FLINT film series starring Dean Martin for the first and Jim Coburn for the second."

      "reviewBody": "Robert Altman is an extremely divisive director in the sense that you either &quot;get it&quot; or you don&apos;t--and those who don&apos;t despise his work and take considerable pleasure in sneering at NASHVILLE in particular. But there is no way around the fact that it is an important film, a highly influential film, to most Altman fans his finest films, and to most series critics quite possibly the single finest film made during the whole of the 1970s.\n\nAccording to the movie trailer available on the DVD release, NASHVILLE is &quot;the damnedest thing you ever saw&quot;--and a truer thing was never said, for it is one of those rare film that completely defies description. On one level, the film follows the lives of some twenty characters over the course of several days leading up to a political rally, lives that collide or don&apos;t collide, that have moments of success and failure, and which in the process explore the hypocrisy that we try to sweep away under the rug of American culture. If it were merely that, the film would be so much soap-opera, but it goes quite a bit further: it juxtaposes its observations with images of American patriotism and politics at their most vulgar, and in the process it makes an incredibly funny, incredibly sad, and remarkably savage statement on the superficial values that plague our society.\n\nWhat most viewers find difficult about NASHVILLE--and about many Altman films--is his refusal to direct our attention within any single scene. Conversations and plot directions overlap with each other, and so much goes on in every scene that you are constantly forced to decide what you will pay attention to and what you will ignore. The result is a film that goes in a hundred different directions with a thousand different meanings, and it would be safe to say that every person who sees it will see a different film.\n\nIn the end, however, all these roads lead to Rome, or in this case to the Roman coliseum of American politics, where fame is gained or lost in the wake of violence, where the strong consume the weak without any real personal malice, and where the current political star is only as good as press agent&apos;s presentation. For those willing and able to dive into the complex web of life it presents, Altman&apos;s masterpiece will be an endlessly fascinating mirror in which we see the energy of life itself scattered, gathered, and reflected back to us. A masterpiece that bears repeated viewings much in the same way that a great novel bears repeated readings. A personal favorite and highly, highly recommended.\n\nGary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

Barsaat was so popular that skinny Raj Kapoor established RK Studios on the back of its success, so without this film it might have been a different movie story in the 1950&apos;s.\n\nHow to sum up a 3 hour film Â the famous love triangle â 2 brothers, Kapoor serious and Prem Nath out for a good time fall in love with the same woman, the beautiful 20 year old Nargis. The relationships have their ups and downs but ultimately alas! Cut into this are some iconic images of Nargis and many mesmerising songs from Shankar-Jaikashan in their debut, apparently all of them sung by Lata â although they let Mukesh in for a few minutes with Chhod Gaye Balaam (with some especially lovely moody photography here starting with Kapoor brooding at the piano). Favourite bit: Ab Mera Kaun Sahara with Nargis in a wistful and sorrowful vein and Lata displaying a marvellously steady vocal control.\n\nIf you have tears prepare to shed them at this unless you have a heart of stone or have seen too many modern movies! I&apos;ve not seen either Barsaat 1995 or 2005 but I don&apos;t think they&apos;re re-makes, in any case I shouldn&apos;t have thought they&apos;d be anywhere near as good as this was.",

In &apos;Snowman&apos; he recreates the can&apos;t-hold-that-loser-down-type in the best possible way. In a series of mishaps, Dorn, who only wants to peddle 3D-porn mags to Arabia, gets in possession of a serious amount of cocaine. Dorn is hunted by several gangster factions, among them some delilghtly freaky personnel. A good pal and a mysterious woman round the story up. The treatment of this formula is just slightly over the top, and the more entertaining. From a book by Joerg Fauser, the film is described as a &apos;free adaptation&apos;, but it keeps the books&apos; tone. Recommended !",

If you like old-school German comedies from the 60s-80s, you will be served a wonderful menu with great production values, good timing, original humor, and an abundance of recent and old guard stars of comedy.\n\nRick Kavanian&apos;s performance is gold, but also Nora Tschirner delivers perfectly in her former trademark role of the Clumsy Nerd. If you are a fan of either of them, go watch it.",

I won&apos;t bore you with the details of the risible plot because there are plenty of other reviewers who have done that. What they have not told you is that this film is a cheat. Yes a cheat. I don&apos;t care if you haven&apos;t paid a penny to watch it, if you watch it to the end, as I stupidly did, it will cheat you out of almost two hours of your life. You know that when a horror film starts out with a group of six, the monsters/ aliens/ zombies/ evil incarnations et al will pick them off one by one. Par for the course. Except in the final scene, we have one character turned into a zombie/ living dead figure another who submerges into a lake to escape the ridiculous Samurai warriors and a plaintive girl struggling up a beach with the warriors emerging behind her and.........roll the credits. Seriously, as the warriors approach her, it goes to black screen and then credits. So what happened to our hero who dived into the lake, the zombified character and the girl? Don&apos;t know. I am only writing this because I feel so angry that the film didn&apos;t even offer a cop-out ending. There wasn&apos;t even an ending! Did they run out of money? Did they become as bored as the rest of us and thought &quot;Hey what, y&apos;know everyone let&apos;s call it a wrap because there&apos;s a great cocktail bar near here and it&apos;s gotta be more fun than doing this.&quot; Cheats!"

I rate the movie as good, there was an interesting plot, the acting was good, and the tale had a good moral.\n\nBut I must admit I would probably have never watched it if it were not for Urmilla&apos;s rendition of Chama Chama. Simply spectacular, one of the greatest things ever. I rank it up there with Dola Re Dola from Devdas, and Rhamba&apos;s Pyaar Achcha Hota Hai from the film Pyaar Diwan Hota Hai.\n\nIn fact I work for a public library and recommended the library purchase both China Gale and Pyaar Diwan Hota Hai simply because I was totally blown away after seeing them on the Chart Busters DVD from Eros Entertainment. Both movies are OK plot wise, but these two are true show stoppers. So I literally would not have seen either movie except for these two songs!",

If said star chooses to make a low-budget non-commercial film, it warrants a free pass to the big dance based on risk-taking and &quot;independent spirit.&quot; So it is with Ellie Parker, a movie produced by and starring Naomi Watts (and directed by actor Scott Coffey) about the travails of a young actress searching for her identity in L.A.&apos;s shallow and artificial cultural wasteland. It is clear that it was made for industry insiders, who saw in it a painful mirror to their world. The rest of us enjoyed a few funny moments in a movie that had no apparent beginning, middle or end, no discernible plot, plenty of conflict but no resolution. I&apos;m sure there was a point in all that depressing futility. To make it worse, it was shot on a Sony HD cam, so the quality was maybe a tad better than my home movies.\n\nEllie Parker would be useful if one were trying to thin the herd of aspiring actresses. Maybe they should show it in high schools, kind of like Reefer Madness 50 years ago.\n\nBy the way, Chevy Chase has a small and rather cryptic role as an agent. (The audience wasn&apos;t sure if he was trying to be serious or comedic.) I love Chevy Chase, but unlike his old SNL partner Dan Akroyd, he should stick to comedies. He gives a really dreadful performance. But he was refreshingly funny at the Sundance Q&amp;A."

      "reviewBody": "During the course of the year before WWI, a series of tragic and suspicious looking incidents take place in a small farming village somewhere in black and white Germany. The culprit or the culprits behind the crime wave will not be too easy to find.\n\nThe doctor, the priest, the baron and the teacher who also narrates the film form the elite of the village. We get to know each one of them and a few other villagers along with children of this village, calm on the surface but deeply tormented by an undercurrent of brutality, envy, malice and apathy.\n\nThe children&apos;s natural path to maturity is blocked by strict religious morality, cruelly enforced by the priest, thereby inhibiting their personal observation of the world around them. The priest feeds children with guilt and sexual repression instead of love and punishes even their most innocent mistakes. Certainly this environment will make it easy for them to not only accept but seek ruthless authority later in life.\n\nAs might be expected, love in this town is restrained and uneasy, while incest and affairs are overlooked by villagers. The Baron employs half of the village in his farm, yet almost no one seems to be against feudalism, nor rise up against the accidents that happen in the workplace. Social justice is a stranger to town, yet villagers are entrenched in apathy.\n\nIf adults do not face up the truth, however this truth might be against their convictions, rise up and take charge, then who will? And according to whose morality? Isn&apos;t fascism with racism, in short Nazism, misdirected popular anger and an easy response to deep injustices within a society ? Haneke observes mostly psychological, educational and religious roots of Nazism while leaving economic aspects mostly in the background.\n\nVisuals of the film are very solid. The symmetry in the shots and the tidiness of the houses, even of those belonging to the poor farmers hint at the discipline and rigor Germans are well known for. Acting is top notch by the whole cast, especially children&apos;s faces beam just like in Bergman films. Directing was superb.\n\nHaneke uses a village and a narrator similar in essence to Lars Von Trier&apos;s Dogville, still these two movies are clearly different.\n\nDas Weisse Band has also some similarities to Cache, but just one notch less satisfying than his masterpiece which had a slightly more intriguing and fulfilling story. This movie is made more accessible by Haneke with his choice of more obvious tips, where sometimes characters talk directly about the situation. But in a time and age when people are battling too many problems and drug themselves with TV and easy payoffs who could blame Haneke? \n\nGiven the current global economic conditions and the fanaticism running high across all three major religions, this is a must-see movie for anyone caring about the future of our global village to avoid a Le Temps du Loup type of ending!",

      "reviewBody": "A sudden electrical storm hits a group of young friends out on a yacht for the day, capsizing it and leaving them drifting. When the large cruise ship Aeolus passes by, they are rescued and climb aboard only to find that the ship is deserted. They wander around the ship feeling more uneasy as they go, until someone wearing a sack and carrying a shotgun starts trying to kill them all.\n\nThe plot summary sounds simple enough not only do we know what genre territory we are in but we also know where it is all going to go and what it is going to do as it goes there. I actually sat braced for a slasher horror movie (not really my type of thing) and for the first thirty minutes things are quite scary, with the &quot;sack killer&quot; being creepy and threatening in the way all mysterious and creepy characters are in this type of villain (those who have seen the Orphanage will understand how creepy a static figure in a sack can be). On this ground the film works very well and the tension is palatable to the point where we can appreciate why Jess starts going crazy. The film then shifts the plot in a way that is very engaging and also very weird; it is best for me not to discuss it too much because it is all the better to try and keep up with it and then spend time afterwards thinking about it and talking about it.\n\nIt does have plot holes and it will not satisfy all viewers but I found that the open nature of it is all part of it and writer/director Smith does help us understand what is going on in the way he names the ship and also makes a point of having the story partially explained by the characters when they first board the ship and see its name. It doesn&apos;t totally make sense and some things are deliberately left unknown (or at least &quot;uncertain&quot;) but it is a great ride that mostly delivers on the way to a very downbeat ending (although you&apos;ll know that is not really the case when you watch it).\n\nIt is driven forward by Smith&apos;s direction making everything claustrophobic and thrilling, even as it becomes more confusing. Melissa George is a massive part of it to though. Her performance is great throughout and she is convincingly disturbed, weird, disturbed and numb as the script requires â her madness is both understandable and alienating. The rest of the cast are not quite as good but this is not really a problem because George and the script are really all that matters.\n\nTriangle is a film you will hear about from people who have seen it and, despite its flaws, it will have stuck in their mind. Hopefully they will not tell you too much about it because the twisty mind-funk is all part of it. It is flawed due to plot holes though but it is hard to really dislike the film for them â particularly when you realise that any problems you have with how the story ends are more to do with how/where the film starts."

      "reviewBody": "After their daughter&apos;s strange behavior alarms them, the discovery of her demonic possession being the cause of it all sends to parents to a local priest and attempts an exorcism to save her.\n\nThis here turned out to be quite the decent and wholly unoriginal take on the genre. The biggest thing with this one tends to be it&apos;s rather blatant and stereotypical use of the genre clichÃ©s which are quite apparent simply due to its&apos; placement in the genre. This one really tends to wallow in those stereotypes featuring the sinful priest, the lustful temptress and the servant who&apos;s lost his way which all manages to fit into the traditional tropes of the genre. It&apos;s all stuff we&apos;ve seen before and doesn&apos;t really alter that much in the way this goes for the traditional stories in these efforts. Where it differs from the norm is the actual exorcism scene itself which is pretty far removed from what usually happens here as this avoids the vomiting and levitation so frequently used in favor of trickery and deception which has quite a nice difference here but showcases another big flaw in that this one being way more talky than anything else. Nothing here really happens as it decides to spell out everything instead of the action route. The back-story for each of the characters and how they come to be stuck in the situation which is really lame and doesn&apos;t matter how it affects the action in the film of the film which suffers greatly because of how dull it is through all this talking rather than going for the action. The exorcism scene being such an utter afterthought that it takes up the final fifteen minutes makes this quite a rather unsatisfying effort just for the sheer brevity of it all really hurts this one overall as well as the other flaws within this one. About the only main saving grace for this one is the lead-up to the exorcism as the events themselves are handled well and create a pretty terrifying picture. Otherwise, this one is pretty flawed.\n\nRated R: Graphic Language, Violence, Nudity, mild sex scenes and themes of incest.",

      "reviewBody": "This is the first of 6 films I intend to watch about the famous Russian sovereign (albeit of German origins) as part of the Josef von Sternberg retrospective, whose masterpiece THE SCARLET EMPRESS â from the same year â also deals with her. It was obviously intended as the British response (through renowned producer Alexander Korda) of the afore-mentioned Paramount release; ironically, the latter had been made â as a vehicle for Marlene Dietrich â in the wake of the classic Greta Garbo title QUEEN Christina (1933)! \n\nEven so, the result here is quite a good film taken on its own merits â though lacking the ornate visual sense and other idiosyncrasies that Sternberg deployed in his version (and which made it so fascinating to watch in the first place). In any case, this has all the virtues and faults of a typical Korda effort: low-key approach undermined by stiff production and buoyed by reliable casting. The latter sees Elizabeth Bergner â the director is her husband â in the title role (though she does well by the character on a human plane, there is little to suggest her &apos;great&apos; qualities as monarch!), top-billed Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (an ambivalent characterization as he goes all-too-swiftly from being submissive to his Empress aunt through a pre-arranged marriage to tyranny: his is a valiant try, but the star&apos;s dashing looks makes this incongruity that more conspicuous!) and Flora Robson (as the ailing Empress who conspires with Catherine to depose her own unstable nephew: the distinguished actress would virtually make a career out of playing monarchs!).\n\nPlot-wise, court intrigue (easily the more interesting aspect to the narrative) is too often swamped by romantic complications and that worst trapping of costumers i.e. archaic dancingÂbut, having grown up watching the Korda films on Italian TV (even if not among its very best examples, this one is solid enough), I kind of have a soft spot for them and, in fact, over the years I managed to collect virtually all of the more notable titles in that popular cycle (including the same year&apos;s THE PRIVATE LIFE OF DON JUAN which, coincidentally, starred Fairbanks pere!). By the way, while this one was originally released in the U.S. as THE RISE OF CATHERINE THE GREAT, it was recently issued on R1 DVD through Criterion&apos;s sister label Eclipse as part of a Korda Box Set (along with DON JUAN itself and two superb Charles Laughton vehicles â namely the Oscar-winning THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII {1933} and, arguably his masterpiece, REMBRANDT {1936}).",

Annette Bening plays a woman tormented with visions of a serial killer luring a little girl away in an apple orchard. When her little girl becomes the latest victim of the killer, she goes on a mission to stop the killer before they can claim another victim. Of course that&apos;s easier said than done when everyone thinks you&apos;re insane and they want to lock you away in an asylum.\n\nNeil Jordan fills In Dreams with tons of style and beautiful cinematography, but the story itself falls apart a little after midway through. After such an intriguing set up, the film can&apos;t help but disappoint once our leading lady meets up with the killer and they try to explain why they&apos;re doing it. It quickly becomes tedious and dull.\n\nThe usually excellent Bening is a bit of a histrionic, manic mess here and a lot of her line readings inspire more laughter than anything else. She&apos;s playing to the back of the house and it&apos;s equal parts deliciously campy and infuriating because it renders her character less a real person and more of a performance.\n\nIn Dreams still has a few things going for it. It&apos;s rich in dreamlike, fairy tale mood, so if that&apos;s something you like, you might find that&apos;s enough to keep you interested, but the story itself isn&apos;t very memorable.",

I am no fan of any of the three leading actresses but they made this a joy to watch. Ted Danson (who I could never warm to in Cheers) impresses me with his timing and (in Damages) his acting talent. The story is simply told and is absorbing, entertaining and (unusually for a modern comedy) funny. Not uproariously but it made me smile on many occasions. The viewer cares about the characters and what happens to them and that is a testament to the writing and direction. It is not the best comedy I have ever seen nor the best heist movie but the sum is greater than the parts. Keaton was very good and Queen Latifah was terrific support. I recommend this for a pleasant way to pass an hour or so.",

This is a tale lovingly and movingly told, with excellent insight into the life of those who follow the troubadour&apos;s muse.\n\nFor all the talk these days of how hard life is for a musician, how hard it is to make a living at music, one has to wonder the degree to which what is meant by such protestations is that it is hard to make a killing at it. This documentary does a wonderful job of showing how hard some musicians struggle just to get by, but regardless of the difficulty they are compelled to keep traveling, making music, playing in front of audiences, small though the audience numbers may be. In some ways this is a great antidote to commercial notions of stardom. The artists portrayed here are stars in their own right, and bring light and inspiration to others in important, intimate ways that cannot, and perhaps should not, be commercially mediated.\n\nThis film is a real treat, and I hope the filmmaker will follow up on it, perhaps even following up with the same artists some years down the road. And let&apos;s hope those artists receive enough encouragement, and compensation, to be making music still down that road.",

DMX goes back to the streets in this gritty gangster movie.  You will be pleased to see him return to a role more similar to the one in his movie debut Belly.  He fits perfectly into the equation of the urban gangster movie. Never Die Alone is based on the novel of the same title by Donald Goines.  DMX plays King David a drug king pin that has came back home to set things strait.  The movie is set in present day New York.  It is told mostly in flash backs, and voice-overs which make the movie very unique.\n\nThe strong plot and acting will keep you interested through the whole movie.  Another aspect, and one that is sometimes over looked is the camera work and picture.  At times the picture is grainy.  This may sound cheap, but it goes perfectly with the harsh and raw story.  The camera angles and shots are also awesome.  Small things like this can make the biggest differences in a movie.  If I had four hands I&apos;d give this movie four thumbs up."

Some facts in life are hard to face, and our fears sometimes overwhelm us in doing the things we want to the most. \n\nTho are parents at time will dive us to do thing we don&apos;t like, Doing right by yourself is what&apos;s best and shown here.\n\nNot only do are two love struck kids grow up but so do their parents.\n\nVery moving, I didn&apos;t shed a tear.

The climax forms the remaining story.Pankaj Kapur is definitely a great actor who somehow has not achieved by recognition he deserves.And this movie I think his best performance.",

If it wasn&apos;t for the large amounts of bad acting, I would almost feel sorry for those actors! Also be ware of some outrageously sexist scenes. The special effects would be already outdated in 1955 not to mention in 1965... Oh! The spacewalks are hilarious, not to mention the planets and the spaceships!

      "name": "One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story ever.",
      "reviewBody": "Stand By Me is yet another one of the stories made into a movie from the author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author in history, Stephen King. Clearly, the central character here is Gordie Lachance, from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself, given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film. This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years, such as Jerry O&apos;Connell, who played Vern, River Phoenix, who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn&apos;t died, Corey Feldman, who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence, Kiefer Sutherland, who has become an excellent and very well known actor, John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie&apos;s late brother, and of course, Richard Dreyfuss, who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult, has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written.\n\nStand By Me takes place in the summer of 1959, the general time period that Stephen King is most skilled at presenting, and four friends set out to find the body of a kid who was killed by a train, hoping to find what they predicted would be astronomical fame. Unfortunately, the town&apos;s bullies are also out to find the body for the same reason, which leads to the films ultimate final climax. Even though this is a very clever story with which to tell a fall from innocence story, it is the brilliant characterization and the incredible acting that really make this a classic film. It is extremely rare that a film comes along that stars young kids and is so moving and powerful. Also, every one of those kids is made three dimensional in creative and smooth ways, making you feel like you really knew them by the end of the film. Vern is the fat kid who always gets picked on, Teddy and Chris both have abusive or deranged fathers, not to mention Chris&apos;s cruel brother, and Gordie is a young boy who lost his brother three months earlier in a violent accident and who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since. In one memorable scene, Gordie wonders how Teddy can be so enthusiastic about his father&apos;s alleged military achievements when the man once held his head to a stove, nearly burning his ear off. Gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father, who hadn&apos;t laid a hand on him since he was three years old and got caught `eating bleach under the sink.&apos;\n\nStephen King pokes fun at his own craft many times in the film, such as in Gordie&apos;s vehement line, `F*ck writing. I don&apos;t want to be a writer, it&apos;s a stupid waste of time!&apos; Not only that, but there are also obvious references to his other works, such as when the boys first realize that no one brought food, and Teddy says, `This is great, what are we supposed to do, eat our feet?&apos; People who actually read instead of just lazily watching the movies will recognize this as a major part of the plot of another of King&apos;s short stories, `Survivor Type,&apos; from which Cast Away borrowed heavily. And why don&apos;t you people read these books? `The Body,&apos; which Stand By Me was based on, is only 148 pages long, you could read that in a couple of hours and the experience is totally different from a movie. It&apos;s even more disturbing that `The Body&apos; was published in the same book (Different Seasons) as a couple of King&apos;s other famous stories Â `Apt Pupil&apos; and, of course, `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.&apos;\n\nStand By Me is a story of how one event can unexpectedly change lives. It seems to be a story about friends and how important they are, but this possible theme is clearly dispelled in a line from the narration spoken at the end of the film Â `As time went on, we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern, until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls. It happens sometimes, friends come in and out of your life like busboys at a restaurant.&apos; Instead, the film is about learning from a life changing experience and actually making changes or modifying your life in some way because of it, and this is heavily emphasized at the end of the film.\n\nStand By Me is a timeless film. Stephen King&apos;s story is skillfully brought to the screen under the direction of Rob Reiner, and the 1950s are brought back to life just as successfully as King so often does in his stories and novels, with the slicked back hair, the hot rods, and in the film, and excellent 50s soundtrack. There is so much more to this film than just the superficial story Â things about the characters and the story, but also about the tremendously talented man who wrote it all.",

      "name": "Another example of why the 70&apos;s was the finest decade for films.",
      "reviewBody": "It is my belief that the finest era for films was the 1970&apos;s. Consider all the classics that were produced in that era (Godfather I and II, Patton, The Sting, Jaws, Mean Streets, The Exorcist, The French Connection, Star Wars etc). My belief was recently validated by Jodie Foster, who essentially said the same thing. One of the reasons why the films were great was that the directors were ostensibly in control of the films, rather than by a committee of the usual Hollywood &quot;insiders&quot; who think they know what people want to see, but rarely make the correct decisions.\n\nI know that this film was re-made( for TV)--God knows why--but I&apos;m sure if they attempted another film version Matt Damon would be playing the grizzled transit police cop (Matthau&apos;s role) and Jude Law would be playing the Robert Shaw role. That&apos;s another reason why the original and other films of the 70&apos;s were so great: the casting was more believable. Today Hollywood is so incredibly youth-obsessed that actors are completely miscast.\n\nI am not stating that this is another 70&apos;s classic, but even this film is far superior to many of today&apos;s films. And yet, I&apos;ll bet you couldn&apos;t find &quot;Pelham&quot; in your local video store.\n\nI love several things about this film. The first thing to hit you is that wonderful, funky score that in some parts sounds like controlled chaos. I love the script, which is not completely dark despite the underlying theme, as there are some very funny moments throughout the film: for instance, the chagrined look on Matthau&apos;s face when he discovers the Japanese visitors can speak English. \n\nThere are many examples of mistaken identity in this film: the supervisor who is gunned down is called &quot;goombah&quot;, but he isn&apos;t Italian; Matthau thinks the black police captain is white over the radio; Matthau mistakes the long-haired undercover cop (who was shot on the train tracks) for a female. I also love the character who plays the mayor, who unbelievably bears a striking resemblance to Mayor Koch, who was elected 3 years later!!!! All in all a great action film, and one that will hold up for years.\n\nAddendum: Well, they&apos;re doing it--they&apos;re re-making this film because Hollywood is almost completely bereft of new ideas (see &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; &quot;Bewitched&quot; the upcoming &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;). I half-expect they will remake &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; next with P.Diddy as Professor Kingsfield.",

It is not even that funny of a title, I just found it humorous for some reason. Anyway, pretty soon I heard so many wonderful things about it and I decided I might as well give it a try, because it at least sounded like it would be entertaining if anything else, and it had Halle Berry, who I always enjoy watching, regardless of the film. I put it in to watch it and immediately my eyes were glued to the television screen.\n\nI thought all the actors and actresses gave extremely powerful performances and the story line was very intriguing and strong where I did not think it would be. This was a very good movie and Halle Berry took on a character that, I at least, had never seen her play before which blew my mind. I liked Del Toro very much in his role, as well. I would go as far as to say that this movie was flawless in it&apos;s acting and performance skills, because there was nothing at all that was poor about it, but even though I say it is a great movie, it just didn&apos;t really excite me, personally. I mean, it was actually kind of a boring movie to watch at some points, but it is still very enjoyable for the performances, like I said. It surprised me how well of a movie it was, and I say if you have not seen it and are not thinking about giving it a chance, you are missing out on something special.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Trancers&quot; is one of the most enjoyable B-movies ever made.  The time travel plot and &quot;fish-out-of-water&quot; aspects make it similar to the first &quot;Terminator,&quot; but try to imagine that classic film with an infinitely lower budget and a more highly developed sense of humor.  On some days, I probably prefer the wisecracking antics of &quot;Trancers&quot; star Tim Thomerson to the earnestness of Michal Biehn in Cameron&apos;s film; in this instance, cheaper production values and more obscure actors do not necessarily equal an inferior product.\n\nThomerson is, without a doubt, the glue that holds the whole silly series together.  He&apos;s a performer, not an actor.  He entertains without emoting. And hey, for this material, that&apos;s fine.  In fact, that&apos;s the bomb.  He could read his lines right off the page in a monotone, and you&apos;d still want to stand up and cheer.\n\nThe only flaw in this film is a slightly boring villain, but everything else is cool - check out Helen Hunt as some kind of trashy &apos;80s biker chick. Best scene?  When Thomerson beats up the stupid punks in the disco.\n\nOverall, an effective blend of the sci-fi and detective genres, and a good indicator of what imagination and a good sense of humor can accomplish in the absence of cash.",

While the acting was impressive all around, Muatasem Mishal, the young actor who played the leading role of Da&apos;ud, offers a superb performance that brings a depth of meaning to the screen with relatively little dialogue. \n\nAn excellent, authentic film. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "That would be my one sentence review of this movie and the TV show that it is based on, but I&apos;ll go more in depth. This movie is likely to weird out and drive away anyone who&apos;s not a fan or a casual viewer of the series. But if you haven&apos;t seen anything relating to Keroro Gunso, the plot is not very hard to figure out. The movie assumes that you already know who the characters are, so you may be left in the dark in that respect, but it&apos;s about a frog-like alien and his companions saving earth, so you shouldn&apos;t be in too much trouble. As a film version of Keroro Gunso, it probably delivers for fans, since it has all of the main characters in it and even a few minor ones. The humor during the film is a bizarre combination of cutesy little kids jokes, pop culture references to Anime and well known films, and occasional stream of dark, apocalyptic creepiness. The deadly serious tone that filled much of it confused me, sort of like if The Simpsons Movie was about Homer dying of cancer. But the grim tone of the x- marks as well as the many forms of the creature Kiruru (filling in the role of boring villain created solely for film version of TV show) inspire some &quot;aw, cool&quot; moments. The voice work is serviceable. Standouts are Takehito Koyasu, who manages to carry the same detached sleaziness that made his character Kururu stand out as the most interesting in the TV show, and Haruna Ikezawa as Momoka, which isn&apos;t really surprising for those who&apos;ve seen the series. As for Gunso himself, Kumiko Watanabe screams and wildly acts, which promises to be a fun portrayal, but as in the TV series, there is some sort of passive blandness to our main character, probably due to his 3-note personality. So, the movie manages to translate the series to the silver screen fairly unchanged. Like the show it is diverting and fun, but goes by so fast and leaves such little impression it&apos;s hard to care. Watch it with beer and friends and it can pass the time (assuming you and your friends are alcoholic otakus).\n\nEDIT(2008): Wow, this review is horrible. I did it when I was, like, up at 3:00 in the morning, but that doesn&apos;t make it any more tolerable. I still stand by most of these opinions, but JEEZE, my writing style was god-awful.

Sciascia&apos;s story about the murdered boss of a building company fits Damiano&apos;s way to illustrate his view on society: too many people are looking for the easy way out and keep their mouths shut. Simple, direct, honest - few films have so much credibility. Still, for an understandable commercial reason, Mrs Cardinale&apos;s role became bigger than it was in the novel.",

      "reviewBody": "Man Without a Star is not ranked as one of Kirk Douglas&apos;s great films, but it&apos;s a personal favorite of mine and a tour de force for this player.\n\nI don&apos;t think any actor in screen history could ever go from zero to 120 in intensity as Kirk Douglas. His character Dempsey Rae in this film is a free footloose cowpoke with charm to spare. When provoked he changes like lightning and he&apos;s a man not to be trifled with. Kirk Douglas could do this better than any other actor. \n\nDouglas gets good support here from western regulars like Jay C. Flippen, Eddy Waller, Roy Barcroft. Claire Trevor, although she&apos;s played more heart of gold floozies than anyone else in cinema history is never bad. Jeanne Crain as the boss bad gal did well being cast against type. \n\nWilliam Campbell was famous for two things, a role in the original Star Trek series as a Klingon Captain named Koloff and the fact he was married once to Judith Exner who also was linked to President Kennedy and Sam Giancana. He&apos;s pretty good in this however as Douglas&apos;s sidekick/protÃ©gÃ© who turns on him for a while. And Richard Boone never gave a bad performance in his life and doesn&apos;t do so here as the foreman Jeanne Crain hires to run roughshod over the smaller ranchers.\n\nWestern fans and Kirk Douglas fans will love this.",

      "reviewBody": "Do you know that old movie rule that you subconsciously decide whether you&apos;re going to enjoy a film or not within the first ten minutes? Well, it wasn&apos;t true this time, because after the opening sequence, I was pretty sure I was going to hate &quot;I Am Number Four&quot;. Thankfully, I was in for a pleasant surprise.\n\nIt all starts with bad CGI-monsters and some guys in Star Trek make-up chasing people around in the jungle. We then cut to some jocks doing tricks on jet skis and some bland blonde girls admiring them - and I thought this is going to be terrible. Then the story picks up and the movie gets better from there.\n\nThe story involves a couple of characters and mysteries, but is never too complicated. After the initial jet ski scene, the main character actually turns out to be played quite charmingly by Alex Pettyfer. He&apos;s supported by his mentor/protector (solid as always: Timothy Olyphant). Glee&apos;s Dianna Agron plays Number Four&apos;s love interest. She comes across very natural, so that the love story that unfolds is actually engaging instead of vomit-inducing like that of that other movie with the whining Vampires and the shirtless Werewolves.\n\nOf course, &quot;I Am Number Four&quot; is by no means a great movie. The CGI sucks in places and the make-up of the bad guys is just awful. Characters are stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of a popcorn movie.\n\nHowever, I think we can all agree that it would be silly to actually expect a masterpiece, considering the movie&apos;s premise. For what it is, &quot;I Am Number Four&quot; is an entertaining little fantasy flick for teenagers and undemanding twenty-somethings. Add to that the fact that this movie is neither a sequel nor a remake, that it&apos;s not based on a comic book, a TV series, a computer game or toys, and it&apos;s enough to lift &quot;I Am Number Four&quot; heads and shoulders above its genre competitors.",

Sadly, despite the color, the film itself is only okay...a lumbering spectacle set in the lumbering country.\n\nWhen the film begins, Jeff (Robert Barrat) is furious at his brother and partner, Steve (George Brent). After all, Jeff works his butt off while Steve parties in the big city. Well, Jeff is announcing that enough is enough and it&apos;s going to end NOW! Well, apparently Steve didn&apos;t exactly believe him and soon makes a muck of things. A bit later, when Jeff takes his annoying brother on an airplane trip to the lumber fields, Steve impulsively steals the plane!! It&apos;s low on fuel and he&apos;s soon forced to land at a nearby lumber camp run by the arch rivals!! Now, he&apos;s stuck there and forced to work for a change. Can Steve manage to do a decent days work AND somehow avert an all out war between the two lumber companies?! And, more importantly, will the audience care?\n\nThe main problem with this film is that Steve is easy to hate. Sure, he improves over time but this seems very unlikely considering what a jerk he is in the first third of the picture. Another is that the female love interest is about as alluring as a cactus! Overall, despite a few good moments, a nice sea plane and a cool explosion, it&apos;s a thoroughly mediocre film and nothing more...so don&apos;t let the color fool you!",

      "reviewBody": "NOTE: This review is of the English-dubbed version of THE GOLDEN GOOSE, dubbed and distributed in the USA by K. Gordon Murray.\n\nOf all the many children&apos;s films exported to the US by &quot;master showman&quot; K. Gordon Murray in the 1960&apos;s, THE GOLDEN GOOSE is one of the three of four best in terms of entertainment value. I showed my children (now teens) this film when they were in the 5-8 age range, and they loved the color, the slapstick comedy, the comforting broadly-played characters, and the sense of fun. Also, this film lacks the Gothic touches and overall weirdness found in some of Murray&apos;s Mexican imports (although those have a lot of appeal for adults watching them today). The young women in the film are dubbed by adults trying to sound like children, which gives the whole film a non-realistic quality, almost like story time at a daycare! I don&apos;t know what frame of reference today&apos;s children would have to help them with something like this--perhaps the skits performed at theme parks or when the high school musical comedy players go to elementary schools to perform--but THE GOLDEN GOOSE holds up well as timeless, simple family entertainment for the under 10 crowd. And the visuals are interesting enough that adults would not be bored. Unfortunately, the days when films such as this played in actual theaters were dead by the early 1970&apos;s--your best bet today for finding old children&apos;s films might be in the DVD/VHS pile at your local dollar store. Some of the children&apos;s films imported by Murray in the later 60&apos;s were more strange than entertaining, but THE GOLDEN GOOSE still contains a lot of entertainment value for those with old-fashioned tastes, or those parents who want to broaden their children&apos;s horizons.",

      "reviewBody": "Movie starts out in 1989 New Jersey. Two twin girls are murdered in a carnival ride called &quot;Dark Ride&quot;--a trip through various horror scenes. The killer is caught and sentenced to life imprisonment and the ride is closed down. Almost 20 years later a bunch of college kids decide (for no good reason) to break into the closed ride one night. And (wouldn&apos;t you know it?) the killer breaks out of his institution he&apos;s in. Three guesses where he goes.\n\nThis movie is positively insulting to any horror movie fan. The plot has been done to death and ALL the characters are by the numbers--there&apos;s the hot guy (Steve), the stoner (Jim), the movie quoting nerd (Bill), the hot blonde (Liz) and the hot brainy brunette (Cathy). They also pick up a blonde hitchhiker (Jen) who, for no reason other than to pad the running time, gives out a looonnngggg stupid monologue. Once these idiots get into the ride it just turns into a formula yawn-inducing mess with the killer stalking and killing them. Also there are these long sequences with these morons stumbling through the ride. They&apos;re not needed--they just eat up time. Really--this was done to death in the 1980s. Do we need a rehash of it? There&apos;s also a pointless nude scene which was so obviously and stupidly shoved in that I felt sorry for the actress. The gore scenes had plenty of blood but were incredibly faked.\n\nActing varies. David Rogers is terrible as Steve and Alex Solovitz as Jim wasn&apos;t much better (although he does try--Rogers doesn&apos;t). Renna is just OK as Bill and Andrea Bogart is WAY over the top as Jen. Her constant screaming and over acting got on my nerves fast. The only good acting was by Jamie-Lynn DiScala as Cathy. There is also a very good score and some cute directorial touches. But--all in all--this is a slow, boring horror film that you&apos;ve seen hundreds of time before--only better. I fast-forwarded through a good portion of this. Skip it.",

      "reviewBody": "Sheer unadulterated genius. SARS WARS is a gut-wrenchingly funny, utterly deranged, deliriously original, absurdist zom-com from Thailand.\n\nA team of thugs kidnap pretty schoolgirl Liu and hold her hostage in an apartment block. Little do they know, a zombie outbreak is taking place in the very same apartment, a giant snake is on the loose, and the government have set a timer to blow up the building to contain the outbreak. Think that sounds crazy? We haven&apos;t met the good guys yet: Khun Khrabii, a stoic hero sent to rescue Liu, his master Thep, a balding lecher with a battery-powered light sabre, and sexy scientist Dr. Diana, creator of an antiviral shot that has a 25 in 26 chance of accidentally making the patient&apos;s head explode. And then there&apos;s the bad guys...\n\nDirector Taweewat Wantha and his team of writers have crafted something akin to the fevered imagination of Peter Jackson&apos;s BRAINDEAD, combined with the wild &quot;mo-lei-tau&quot; surreal/spoof humour of Hong Kong&apos;s Stephen Chow. The actual zombie and horror-themed content is surprisingly well realised, with excellent make-up effects, some great CGI sequences, and a real sense of tension; but its in the ridiculous send-ups of everything from Japanimation to John Woo to Star Wars to The Crying Game that the movie really takes off.\n\nThoroughly self-aware, characters constantly make references to the film&apos;s attempts to &quot;make money, not win awards&quot;: a little unfair, because there is far more craft and ability on view in this film than in a hundred Hollywood blockbusters put together. Certainly none of the recent crop of zombie films pouring out of Hollywood come close. Even Stephen Chow, the acknowledged king of this style of comedy, should feel threatened: this is a better film than KUNG FU HUSTLE, and is possibly even better than SHAOLIN SOCCER too.",

I mean, can you imagine? -- Here&apos;s a film that takes the airship absolutely seriously as an equal partner with the airplane. Here&apos;s a film that shows you basically how an airship was constructed and what it looked like inside, and all that as part of the plot! And if you&apos;re going to interrupt the main plot with a soap opera, who better to put in front of your eyes than the beautiful Fay Wray? And what a great way to get out of the romantic sub-plot&apos;s basic dilemma -- nice, clean, and fast. All things considered, a more than satisfying way to spend an evening.",

      "reviewBody": "Rural France fascinates the French, and to those in the main cities like Paris, Marseille and Lyon it is regarded as that &apos; other place &apos; where people behave very differently. Crudely put they are either simpletons or people of the earth representing the true nature of life. This film tends towards the former attitude but it is a somewhat &apos; gentle &apos; attack against stupidity and vulgarity by concentrating on the children of two villages who go to &apos; war &apos; against each other. They of course represent the grown-ups around them who are often either drunk or slightly violent in their approach to each other. It is fun to watch as both sides take &apos; prisoners &apos; and &apos; torture &apos; them by tearing off all the bottons on their clothes, and so we have in one scene the laughable situation of a battle scene in the nude. As the children imitate their elders by using swear words they barely understand this all appears vaguely shocking, especially to the West Germans who cut it, and the prudish English giving it an &apos; X &apos; certificate. That just shows how two countries can be as backward as the two opposing village children. As for the film itself it is well filmed and the director Yves Robert speeds the whole absurdity along with zest. Personally I got a bit bored with the relentless and overbearing music, and the sheer noise of the whole thing, and a feeling of monotony ( the enemy of all cinema ) set in. No spoilers but the ending is rather moving and the last line of the film painfully relevant to the ( partial ) side the film is on. It also errs on the side of sentimentality which grated on me, especially concerning one of the smaller children, but taking all things into consideration it is an oddity worth seeing.",

This was a nicely cutting edge teenage romantic comedy about two strangers played by Michael Cera and Kat Dennings who find out about their similarities only after their friends accidentally put them together. Cera still is pining for an ex he puts a mixed CD for while Dennings is friends with that ex. Michael&apos;s character is also a member of a band whose other members are gay while Kat&apos;s character has a girlfriend who likes to drink. And all this happens while Cera and Dennings and their friends ride around New York City all night looking for their favorite indie band. Plenty of sweet and funny (and a little gross) moments abound and while my sister and I might have a little problem with a sex scene with the leads, the romance was good enough to overcome that. So on that note, I recommend Nick and Norah&apos;s Infinite Playlist. P.S. There are cameos of a couple of current SNLers I pleasantly noticed right away...",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this tonight in a screening at our local community college with the producer present. It was a huge, standing room only crowd, and it was clearly a hit with the viewers. Producer Robert Greenwald uses an interesting device of running a rah-rah speech of WalMart&apos;s CEO at a company meeting, with the CEO bragging about all of WalMart&apos;s great policies towards employees, the environment, customers, etc., alternated with clips of dozens of ordinary people testifying to quite the opposite. The stories of small town businesspeople having to close their family stores were especially poignant, as well as the interviews with exploited overseas workers in Walmart&apos;s sweatshops. Even one of the company&apos;s plant inspectors said he just cried when he went back to his hotel after his first inspection.\n\nFull of astounding facts about the true costs of WalMart, the over two billion dollars it has cost US taxpayers in subsidies, welfare programs for underpaid employees, etc. It became very clear that, whether or not you shop there, it&apos;s costing you money, money that&apos;s going right into the pockets of the Walton family. It&apos;s costing all of us our way of life.\n\nQuite an eyeopener. I, for one, plan to never patronize WalMart again.",

Those two mistakes were:\n\n[1] Completely forgotten to check IMDb before watching this film [2] Completely forgotten the fact that Miss Paris can never act !\n\nAnd because of the mistakes, I have sat through an hour and a half watching this dull, boring and utter crap film. I never thought that I&apos;d be reviewing film that Miss Paris acted in, but I think there is need to tell readers how bad this movie is. Whilst commenting on this film would not get me a Nobel prize, at least it&apos;ll save valuable time to those who listen to my advice not to watch this film.\n\nA very poor rating of 1.9 out of 10 is a testament of how bad the film is. It shows that albeit some may find the movie to their liking, majority of the voters said that this movie is very bad ! So my advice is, pass this movie, and buy / rent some other titles instead.\n\nParis Hilton is...... Paris Hilton. No matter how many films she had starred in, or how many hours she had spend time in acting classes, the fact remains that she can never act. Experience does come in handy in other profession, but in acting, it&apos;s clear; One either have the talent, or one do not. Watching her wooden acting is so painful, and I hope she can quit acting, and find other better things to do instead. I think it is better if she becomes her dad&apos;s apprentice and learn her way in hotel business. She&apos;ll be a suitable heiress to her dad business.\n\nSo, a palatable score of 1 out of 10. To those who are involved in the production of this film, count yourselves lucky because I can&apos;t rate this film a zero."

I didn&apos;t know that Spencer Tracy won his first Oscar for this film, but it was certainly well deserved. His portrayal of Manuel is really pivotal to the success of the film, I think.  I&apos;m not too sure about his accent, but it wasn&apos;t really distracting or anything.  If you haven&apos;t seen this, watch it!  You won&apos;t be disappointed -- especially if you enjoy pictures where ships and the sea are the setting for the action.",

Is it not the same kind of awe the passers by experienced when they saw that morning a tiny figure suspended above the void, the same kind of marvel the people interviewed experienced again when they described Petit&apos;s walking on air some thirty years later? What is Petit&apos;s accomplishment if not a profound religious experience, a form of divinity in itself? And it is exactly because Petit&apos;s action bears no explanation, it has no rationale behind its daring do, no tangible end by which to hold it and examine it in the light of logic. The action in the same time the reason of it. What did Petit accomplish but a monument of human perseverance, enduring will and the triumph of mind over matter? \n\nIf MAN ON WIRE is so successful at what it does, it&apos;s not only because of the feat it purports to describe but because of the path it takes in describing it. Staging it as a heist thriller, filmed in black and white in shades of noir, orchestrated like a bank robbery of sorts, the same kind of films Petit laboriously studied as he was preparing his takeover. By presenting us with real people who emote better than a lot of actors could even dream of. By placing Phillip Petit pivotal in the narration of the events unfolding, a passionate man with an almost half-mad gleam in his eye but also a love of life that leaps across the screen as utterly genuine. By adopting the skeleton of a real movie - not a sterile &quot;went there, did that&quot; documentary but one with a premise, plot, setup and payoff, climax and conclusion.\n\nFilmed with true cinematographic flair, in turns suspenseful, faith-reaffirming and awe-inspiring, MAN ON WIRE is the unexpected show-stealer of the year, sneaking under the nose of Hollywood behemoths with 50 times its budget and doing what they&apos;re too sluggish to do, too dazzled by their own spectacle. A simple story beautifully told."

      "reviewBody": "Third and last entry in the series, deemed the worst (rated BOMB in the &quot;Leonard Maltin Film Guide&quot;) but actually slightly superior to its predecessor due, for one thing, to its having a proper plot line (rather than a rehashed one) and the fact that the mad scientist (even if he is stubbornly referred to as &quot;Mr.&quot; Stendhal throughout!) this time around is just that. Indeed, here too, the mainstay (apart, that is, from the standard &apos;house style&apos; for this type of fare) is Otto Kruger&apos;s central performance (the Ape Woman herself, now played by Vicki Lane instead of Acquanetta and reverting once more to being a mute, is certainly not the protagonist in this case!).\n\nKruger is involved in the revivification of small animals but is keen to progress on to larger ones â with his ultimate goal, of course, being Man himself; since the title creature (a convenient and somewhat lazy amalgam of the earlier &apos;episodes&apos; in the franchise) is a hybrid, he knows he will be almost there if he manages to resuscitate her. The problem is that, once she has assumed human form yet again (having made imposing henchman Rondo Hatton steal the necessary files from the home of the doctor played by J. Carroll Naish in JUNGLE WOMAN {1944}, the process having actually been laid down by John Carradine in CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN {1943} â neither of these actors, however, put in &apos;unofficial&apos; appearance and, thankfully, we are also spared the circus stock footage that made-up a sizable amount of the earlier films&apos; running-time), it is discovered that she has suffered brain damage and he plans to replace it with that of his own female aide. Why the doctor, certainly among the coldest of his ilk, does not simply abduct another girl, when he would invariably have benefited from the heroine&apos;s presence by his side rather than as a laboratory subject, is anybody&apos;s guessÂbut, then, the latter is vehemently against her superior&apos;s intention to play God so, in this way, he would be removing the threat to his Great Experiment, were it not for the fact that, through Hatton&apos;s sloppiness, the Police â in the guise of a bemused Jerome Cowan â are already on his trail, and so is the girl&apos;s fiancÃ©, yet another assistant! \n\nThe busy finale has hero and heroine taking advantage of the Ape Woman&apos;s disappearance to escape Kruger and Hatton&apos;s clutches, only for the three to be recaptured after a short while in one fell swoop. Needless to say, however, the villain is not allowed to go through with the operation as Hatton, enamored of the leading lady (which Kruger puts down by referring to his &quot;hardly Casanova&quot; looks, the actor having been stricken with the deforming affliction acromegaly, and to add salt to the wound suggests that the Jungle Captive is &quot;more in your line&quot;!), turns on Stendhal at the instigation of the girl&apos;s boyfriend. The doctor shoots his thug dead, Lane metamorphoses into monster and cuts free of her straps and, just as she is about to incongruously attack her &apos;donor&apos;, Cowan appears on the premises to intervene. For the record, director Young, who had the classic swashbuckler THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL (1934), an Alexander Korda production, on his resume&apos; was now reduced, for whatever reason, to helming the lowliest of Universal Horrors â though, to be fair, he sure made an entertaining job of it!",

I would have to disagree on one important point, however: There are some EXCELLENT songs in the movie. In fact, two of them might easily make an all-time top 25 list. &apos;Aap ke haseen rukh&apos; is one of the very best songs in Hindi films, in my opinion. The lyrics and the melody combine to create an exquisite harmony, and Rafi&apos;s singing is indeed superb. &apos;Woh hanske mile humse&apos; is another haunting melody that would have to be included as an all-time classic. Asha does a magnificent job of conveying the pain in the character&apos;s mind through her singing. And finally, the title song is not all that bad either. The song, sung while the hero is on a train has a jaunty, positive ring to it, and is quite catchy.\n\nSince I am among those who watch old movies primarily for their songs, I would urge you to please not to disregard BPBA on account of its music! It will leave you humming its tunes for decades to come, as it has for me.\n\nRK"

      "reviewBody": "Review of &quot;The Rite&quot; DVD Rated PG-13 114 minutes By Leticia Velasquez Catholic Media Review\n\nMichael Kovak (Colin O&apos;Donoghue) has always been &quot;a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.&quot; (Isaiah 53:3) The only son of a Chicago funeral director, Itsvan Kovak (Rutger Haer) Michael lived literally down the hall from death his entire life. Unlike most young men who never experience death close hand, Michael is steeped in it, preparing bodies for burial with his father. As a young boy, Michael is coaxed by his father into helping prepare the corpse of his mother, by gently blowing on the red fingernail polish his father applies as he lovingly prepared her body, while whispering endearments into her ear. The image is forever seared into his memory, tainting his adulthood with a lack of faith and a sense of detachment. \n\nWhen time came to make a decision about his profession in life, Michael knew well that his options were limited, as he told a friend, &quot;in my family; you either become an undertaker or a priest&quot;. Michael chose the priesthood, not out of sense of mission, but as a way out of his bleak existence and a means to pay for college. After he is ordained as a deacon, Michael&apos;s guilt over deceiving his superior about his intentions impels him to write Fr Matthew (Toby Jones) about his decision to leave the seminary. He admits he has no faith and feels he has no vocation to the priesthood. \n\nBut fate intervenes before Fr Matthew can act. The two men are involved in a car accident where a young woman is fatally wounded and Fr Matthew looks on stunned silence as Michael blesses the victim reluctantly yet tenderly as she dies. He is impressed by this and convinces Michael to delay leaving the seminary until after he has taken a two month course in Rome. A course in exorcism; &quot;you&apos;re an undertaker, so you&apos;re not squeamish&quot; he adds with a gleam in his eye.\n\nNot at all squeamish, Michael plays the role of devil&apos;s advocate in his exorcism class in Rome, challenging his instructor over whether the possessed are suffering from psychosis, and is nonplussed over a sudden power outage when the demon Baal is mentioned. In order to help Michael overcome his doubts about the existence of Satan, his professor, Fr Xavier (Ciaran Hinds) sends him to observe veteran exorcist Fr Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins). Michael is joined in his doubts by Italian journalist Angeline (Alice Braga) who wants him to share his experiences at Fr Lucas side for the purposes of an article. These two young cynics are about to engage in a life and death struggle which will evoke deep- seated fears and upend their world view\n\nAn eccentric Welshman, Fr Lucas lives a lonely existence in an obscure corner of Rome, occupying an ancient villa whose courtyard is overrun by cats. Fr Lucas takes Michael&apos;s cynicism in stride, and advises Michael not to engage in conversation with the demon who possesses the pregnant teen who has come with her sister for her regular exorcism session. Michael is so captivated by her predicament that he finds himself drawn into a life and death struggle with the devil whose very existence he denies.\n\nAlthough the movie trailer plays like a high-tech adaptation of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, to which exorcism films will inevitably be compared, there is more spiritual and emotional depth to director Mikael Hafstrom&apos;s work than Blatty&apos;s. &quot;The Rite&quot; more closely resembles the cinematic subtlety and theological accuracy of &quot;The Exorcism of Emily Rose&quot;, according to Fr. Gary Thomas, the priest from the book on which the film is based. Michael is a sympathetic character and the film&apos;s dramatic exposition of the tragic origins of his faith crisis help the audience sympathize with him as he confronts demons both within and without his tortured soul. Even eccentric Father Lucas, played compellingly by Hopkins is more vivid than the ghostly older priest in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, yet the pairing of priests to defeat Satan is a familiar theme. Fr Lucas even makes a sarcastic reference to &quot;The Exorcist&quot; telling Michael, &quot;You&apos;ll see no spinning heads and pea soup here!&quot; What will enliven Catholic viewers is the authenticity of the phenomena of the exorcisms and the splendor of the priesthood when contrasted against the darkness of pure evil. Special effects enhance but do not overpower this compelling thriller and magnificent architecture of Rome augments the timelessness of the story. \n\nFor the many fans of the book by AP journalist Matt Baglio, on which the film is loosely based, screenwriter Michael Petroni has respected the basic story while raising the emotional stakes to great dramatic effect when combined with excellent cinematography and the masterful presence of Anthony Hopkins. Priests who watched the film in the theater with me had a positive reaction but pointed the following theological errors; as a deacon, Michael could not give absolution as he appears to do in the case of the dying woman, and that an inexperienced priest with emotional wounds and of questionable faith would never be chosen to become an exorcist. Too many weaknesses for Satan to exploit, they explained. The manifestations of possession (vomiting nails and frogs, unearthly voices, superhuman strength and knowledge of inner weaknesses) are absolutely accurate, according to Fr Gary Thomas, the real priest from Baglio&apos;s book, who had a less dramatic change of heart about the existence of Satan. When I asked him in an interview whether he believed that the devil was a being he responded, &quot;I believed when I met him&quot;. \n\nFor older teens and up for frightening and macabre scenes, appropriate but vivid sexual innuendo (verbal references to incest and rape) and foul language. This film is best seen with parental supervision.",

Nick befriends Peg Dobbs( Shelley Winters) who thinking this may be the love interest she has been waiting for, invites him to her family&apos;s apartment. Peg, along with her father (Wallace Ford), mother (Selena Royle) and little brother (Bobby Hyatt), become terrified hostages, never knowing if or when Nick may blow-up and kill them all.\n\nThis small-scale, modestly-budgeted independent production does a tremendous job of evoking the nervous, sweaty environment of its characters. Garfield is terrific as usual, playing a very unsympathetic character with surprising honesty and no glamor. Winters and Ford are also very effective. This film marks the last movie of John Garfield, an amazingly gifted actor, who never had a breakthrough film. While his body of work is substantial, the elusive blockbuster remains just that. Good performances all around, but the screenplay and the setting make for a claustrophobic experience.\n\nJust an aside, but Ford&apos;s character&apos;s name is Fred Dobbs, Bogie&apos;s character in Treasure of the Sierra Madre made three years before. I found that very distracting.",

Now here is a song that reminds me of this movie.\n\nSomebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain&apos;t the sharpest tool in the shed She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an &quot;L&quot; on her forehead\n\nWell, the years start coming and they don&apos;t stop coming Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running Didn&apos;t make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb\n\nSo much to do, so much to see So what&apos;s wrong with taking the back streets?\n\nYou&apos;ll never know if you don&apos;t go (GO!) You&apos;ll never shine if you don&apos;t glow\n\nHey, now, you&apos;re an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey, now, you&apos;re a rock star, get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold.",

Carreras has smuggled a nuclear bomb on the ship and plans to detonate it after stealing some gold bullion from a US cargo ship they plan to draw to them. Carter takes matters into his own hands and teams with the ship&apos;s doctor (Gordon Jackson) and beautiful passenger Susan (Ann Turkel) to take on the terrorists and save all of the passengers. \n\nAdapted from an Alistair MacLean novel, this action-suspense flick was unleashed with posters promising, &quot;The action of THE GUNS OF NAVARONE! The suspense of ICE STATION ZEBRA! The drama of WHERE EAGLES DARE!&quot; I don&apos;t think it came through on any of those. The script is muddled with the first 40 minutes trying for suspense but getting brain twists. Also, the blooming romantic relationship between Harris and Turkel will leave you going, &quot;Huh?&quot; as she slaps him and then he kisses her. Director Ashley Lazarus just can&apos;t seem to get things to work and, if the IMDb is correct, some extra work was done by Freddie Francis. The abrupt ending would suggest a troubled production. Too bad as this has one of those ensemble casts that only a 70s disaster epic could secure and they are all game. In addition to Harris, Turkel and Vernon, you get supporting roles by David Janssen, Burgess Meredith, John Carradine, Dorthy Malone and Robert Beatty. The film also has one of the most ill-fitting synthesizer scores I&apos;ve ever heard.",

The impressionistic style from the novel is recaptured with success by Svend Methling Sr. and a group of excellent performers are casted beautifully in the different parts bringing this epic of Robert Altman-like complexity into motion. The direction is precise and to the point and never before has a collective actors effort on this scale come out as effective as in this production. Going back in time you experience a society with strict rules and regulations where people have to maneuver with extreme difficulty to survive as vulnerable human beings. From his own homosexual existence Herman Bang knew social restrictions on people very well, and bringing his low key dramas on to film is an accomplishment of never surpassed magnitude.",

      "reviewBody": "Quills is the modernized story of the Marquis de Sade, whose steamy writings whipped France into a sexual fury in the late 18th Century. And by modernized I mean that it has been told through the experiences of a lot of French people who speak English and with British accents. But no matter, I&apos;m willing to accept that everyone in France in 1800 spoke perfect British even if only because of Geoffrey Rush&apos;s brilliant performance. With every movie that he comes out with I become more and more convinced that there is nothing he can&apos;t do.\n\nIn order to know virtue, as the Marquis explains, one must first understand vice. In Philip Kaufman&apos;s Quills, the focus is on the Marquis de Sade after his writing has taken him beyond the artistic freedom generally accepted in the 18th and 19th centuries, even to elite aristocracy like himself. It is a detailed exploration of the events that led from him being a social elitist to living almost three decades in prison, writing things that caused his keepers to make it so difficult for him to write that he ultimately uses his own blood and excrement for ink, and his clothing, the walls of his cell, and his own skin as parchment.\n\nLuckily for the Marquis, at first anyway, is that there is something of an understanding priest in the Abbe du Coulmier, another wonderful performance from Joaquin Phoenix. An intensely religious man, Coulmier believes that the Marquis should be allowed to write, if only to purge himself of the sadism with which his head is filled and which would later be named after him.\n\nKate Winslet plays Madeleine, a laundry maid who smuggles the Marquis&apos; writing out of the asylum so that it can be published, for which many people are not happy, but many others are. The Marquis dips into the extensive world of the forbidden sexual taboos of the 18th and 19th centuries, writing extensively about them without a care in the world for propriety. One may wonder to what extent the Marquis&apos; writings were such a hit because they were forbidden, or because of their lewd content, which may euphemistically be described as guilty pleasures for the masses. Indeed, Larry Flynt was not working, so graphic pornography was something of a rarity.\n\nThere is a curious relationship between the Marquis and a physician named Royer-Collard, played by Michael Caine, who is assigned to law down the law with the Marquis and prevent him from writing anymore. The glee with which the Marquis mocks and taunts him are some of the best parts of this outstanding film. There is a great parallel between the two characters, as well. Royer-Collard pretends to be a moral role model, at the same time taking a wife who is young enough to be his daughter, possibly even his granddaughter, and treats the Marquis with exactly the same sadistic (if I can again use the term for the behavior for which the Marquis would later be named) behavior that he condemns that Marquis for writing about. Both men engage in many of the same practices, it&apos;s just that the Marquis makes no attempt and has no interest in hiding his interests in the pleasures of the flesh.\n\nI think that the most important thing to remember about this movie is that it is able to deal with a person who&apos;s beliefs are, I like to think, below the moral compasses of most of the people who will watch the movie, but it&apos;s not about what he was writing, it&apos;s about the fact that he was writing at all. It&apos;s about his defiance in the face of a corrupt moral authority, his insistence on maintaining an artistic expression that was not well received but that was certainly therapeutic to him. Sure, his sanity is in question, to say the least, but as they say, genius is often associated with madness.\n\nWhat a great coincidence, too, because so is Geoffrey Rush.",

      "reviewBody": "Winning combination of scattershot comedy and wry, wistful drama tells the (alleged) true story of a milkman with big dreams and no money who is curiously named a recipient in the will of multi-millionaire Howard Hughes. Melvin Dummar (played by Paul LeMat, in a terrific performance) had been saying all along he once helped out an old guy in the desert near Las Vegas who claimed he was Hughes, but Dummar didn&apos;t really believe him (they had a nice chat anyway, and Melvin got Howard to sing one of his self-written novelty songs as well as &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;). Good-natured film directed by Jonathan Demme rarely loses its way, and features an endearing collection of screwballs who make the loopy craziness of the situations and dialogue immediate and real--their eccentricities are the roots of the story. Mary Steenburgen won a Supporting Oscar as Dummar&apos;s first wife, a dreamer like Melvin who is far less satisfied with struggling and who just wants to amount to something (but to Melvin, the struggles are the best part). Jason Robards is perfect as Hughes; the normally bombastic actor takes a small role and lets it bloom subtly and beautifully for us, giving the movie a misty hue and making all of Melvin&apos;s hopes sweetly credible. ***1/2 from ****",

A man, Marc, gradually loses his grip on reality after shaving his mustache that was always there as part of his look as a man (or at least he thinks it was). The movie is seen through Marc&apos;s perspective which makes it difficult to discern reality from his bouts of schizophrenic hallucinations. \n\nAt some points the movie reminds me of Lost Highway in the manner with which it represented the split of the protagonist (or rather a metamorphosis) into two different characters. In La Moustache the split happens at the level of the &quot;life&quot; of the protagonist, his world is constantly subjected to transformations, while he more or less stays the same. However in LH we can discern the &quot;true&quot; part of the protagonist from his &quot;imagined&quot; part. That distinction is impossible in La Moustache ; we don&apos;t know where his madness starts and where it ends. He is a total mess, and it is upon this ambiguity that everything we see is built.\n\nAll in all, this movie was a really nice surprise that I highly enjoyed and that I recommend for fans of Lynch, Cronenberg and psychological thrillers/dramas.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie, whose title translates to &quot;The Angel in the Clock&quot; is a very brave proposition from Mexico&apos;s animation industry, which has had a very marked tendency of continuing to believe that animation is &quot;for children&quot;, with stories that usually fall within the stereotypes of very childish humor, non-fluid animation with plain character designs and boringly simple plots (see: most of Ãnima Estudios&apos; output). &quot;The Angel&quot; sets itself aside from most of these from the very start by making it clear that Amelia, the protagonist, is a young girl undergoing cancer treatment.\n\nShe cannot exert herself too much (a pain since her biggest passion is dance) and she sports a shaved head (this, along with her animation made it impossible for me not to think of her as &quot;girl Aang&quot;) throughout. With this in mind, the plot has lofty aspirations for being a Very-Important-Family-Movie-About-Emotional-Maturity, like &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot; or even &quot;A Monster Calls&quot;. It doesn&apos;t succeed entirely, mosty due to some narrative hiccups, but Amelia&apos;s situation leads to the movie being overall surprisingly philosophical about the subject of time (clearly a key topic for anyone with such a heavy illness, and for those who surround them).\n\nThe movie is also distinguished by visuals that, again, are unlike those of most of its peers. The character and background designs owe a massive debt to sources as diverse as The Legend of Zelda, Guillermo del Toro and Studio Ghibli (at times a bit TOO massive, while I loved the character of No-Time, its name and design blur the line between homage and plagiarism to No-Face), leading to an original and very pleasing visual cocktail. A significant portion of the budget must have gone to the SFX animation because it is truly world-class for this type of cel-shaded animation, I do not exaggerate in saying that it is as good as that in a GOOD anime. All this in addition to an effective soundtrack make &quot;The Angel&quot; one of those rare Mexican movies that fully understands the importance of audiovisuals in cinema.\n\nI mentioned the budget mostly going to SFX and this brings me to the weak spots of the film, one of which is that the rest of the animation doesn&apos;t live up to its high points. This is a relatively cheap production, and it shows. While there are methods to make limited resources go a long way, the character animation usually just scrapes by. While the plot manages to cleverly handle some heavy, bold themes, the actual narrative is cobbled together and the seams of where tension or coincidences are forced in definitely tend to show. Some characters, specially the typical &quot;comic relief companions&quot; aren&apos;t that funny and don&apos;t really transcend those roles.\n\nThis is not a perfect movie, its flaws are undeniable and noticeable, but it is also importantly brave and novel for its context. Mexican animation rarely dares to try something so different from its usual toothless, hard G-rated fare, so to see a project like &quot;The Angel&quot;, with imaginative visuals, philosophical dialogues about time and a very atypical protagonist really makes one hopeful for the possible future of the industry (yes, even when the Here and Now are what matter most).",

His mother, ably played by Cher, portrays a biker babe who loves her son but little else. Sam Eliot plays her biker boyfriend but also has a soft spot for Rocky. Rocky loves a blind girl, played wonderfully by Laura Dern. All in all, this is a touching, but not overly sappy film! This one is worth a watch.",
