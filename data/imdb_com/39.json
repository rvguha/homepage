      "reviewBody": "&apos;Hardcore&apos; is the riveting story of a newly-made cyborg who must save his wife from evil tyrants and...wait a minute. Who cares?? The whole movie is a blast!!\n\nIlya Naishuller is a young director who had a very cool idea to shoot an action film from a first-person perspective using a GoPro Hero3 Black Edition camera. The proof of concept was released as &quot;Biting Elbows: Bad Motherf***er&quot;. It was pitched publicly and helped to successfully crowd-fund the feature, &apos;Hardcore&apos;.\n\nIt&apos;s better to keep this short and sweet: the film is extraordinarily violent; not for the squeamish. It has plenty of action, free-running, stunts, and plenty of room for comedic elements. Even the opening titles give you a taste of what&apos;s to come!\n\nSharlto Copley (District 9, and other Neill Blomkamp projects) plays the main POV&apos;s assistant throughout the film. Copley definitely gives a range of character performances and is quality. Wearing many hats, he guides you along as if you were needing assistance in a video game, which, by the way, this film makes several references to. In particular, the Chernobyl level in Call of Duty 4 with Capt. MacMillian. Even the opening scenes are reminiscent of Half-Life, and a lot of the free-running scenes are inspired by Mirror&apos;s Edge.\n\nFor those who are wondering, no. You likely won&apos;t get dizzy watching a 90-minute action film from an FP perspective. Well, maybe you shouldn&apos;t sit in the front row. Otherwise, you will have a blast.\n\n&apos;Hardcore&apos; is an all-around fun time. Just be okay with the violence. It&apos;s only 90 minutes of your time that you&apos;ll likely want to experience over and over again. Or, you&apos;ll just want to plug in a play a few games. \n\nEither way, it&apos;s bloody fun!",

Mainly because you&apos;ve just been brought back from the dead by your wife (Haley Bennett). She tells you that your name is Henry. Five minutes later, you are being shot at, your wife has been kidnapped, and you should probably go get her back. Who&apos;s got her? His name&apos;s Akan; he&apos;s a powerful warlord with an army of mercenaries, and a plan for world domination. You&apos;re also in an unfamiliar city of Moscow, and everyone wants you dead. Everyone except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy. He may be on your side, but you aren&apos;t sure. If you can survive the insanity, and solve the mystery, you might just discover your purpose and the truth behind your identity. Good luck, Henry. You&apos;re likely going to need it...",

Screenedit is worst and you cant find any serial red line throw the story to follow the content. The jokes aren&apos;t good and the acting is also miserable. This movie is like a mix of Craig Mazins &quot;Superhero Movie&quot; and Brian Helgelands &quot;A Knight&apos;s Tale&quot; with typical German influences. Kind of Slapstick comedy without the comedy (like Superhero Movie).\n\nSummary : 1 1/2 hours waste of time 3/10",

When I came online to recommend it, I was quite shocked to see the low ratings and critical reviews - although the financial flop explains why it never made it to cinemas or even rated a mention locally.\n\nRock Dog isn&apos;t brilliant - this isn&apos;t &apos;Kubo&apos; or a Pixar classic.

      "reviewBody": "I concluded my &quot;Ginger and Fred&quot; review saying the experience was worth all the weirdness if only for that final reunion reunion between Fellini fetish actors Giuletta Masina and Marcello Mastroianni. After watching &quot;Intervista&quot;, I can make exactly the same statement. The film isn&apos;t without flaws, Fellini&apos;s tendency to swing from one perspective to another can be frustratingly disorienting, even for viewers used to his anarchic style and who aspires from some semblance of coherence. The film also doesn&apos;t have the same pace than &quot;Ginger and Fred&quot; with two characters being like narrative backbones and making any kind of intermission useless (while &quot;Intervista&quot; is full of them) but for all these imperfections, &quot;Intervista&quot; was worth my time for one particular sequence.\n\nNear the end of the film, there&apos;s a magnificent and emotional moment when Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni are watching sequences from &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; on an improvised big screen and there was no way their emotion was acted or feigned, Anita&apos;s tears were those of a once beautiful woman who realizes how time passes and her smile and childish eyes still carry that joyful spirit and innocent lust that took her to that iconic midnight bath in the Trevi fountain. And her chemistry with Marcello &quot;Come here&quot; Mastroianni was still there; watching that scene where he asked for a grappa, I knew their complicity was genuine, the merit of great actors is to know when they don&apos;t need to act.\n\nAnd the genius of Fellini is to know when he doesn&apos;t even need to direct, just reuse some footage from a previous classic and the magic operates. For that scene only, for these little five minutes, &quot;Intervista&quot; is certainly a movie I would recommend to a fan of Fellini, not a newbie for it takes a certain knowledge of his work to fully enjoy it. And I believe the Maestro knew only viewers familiar with his movies would appreciate it. Well, let&apos;s just say this is a film that cannot be watched before &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, and it also feels as a continuation of Fellini&apos;s nostalgic trip started one year before with &quot;Ginger and Fred&quot;. These are movies that couldn&apos;t come earlier in his work anyway, both carrying a mix of detachment and introspection that can&apos;t result from the mind of a young director.\n\nAnd while &quot;Ginger and Fred&quot; was a love letter to Hollywood, &quot;Intervista&quot; is a back-to-the-roots journey that echoes Fellini&apos;s most puzzling masterpiece &quot;8 ½&quot;, in a more accessible but no less eccentric way. The 1963 classic was more complex as it was dealing with autobiographical material combined with an exploration in the author&apos;s psyche revealing how his youth memories were the alphabet he wrote his language with. But as Fellini said in an interview, he gained too much weight and couldn&apos;t escape from a car hanging on a kite, more pragmatic in &quot;Intervista&quot;, he simply shares his passion through an interview with Japanese journalists. An interview is a trigger, hence the title &quot;Intervista&quot;.\n\nThe film focuses on Fellini&apos;s debut as a journalist visiting Cinecitta to interview a known diva, he&apos;s played by Sergio Rubini. But we couldn&apos;t see Fellini for no reason, so he inserts his trademark film-in-the-film plot, which is an adaptation of Kafka&apos;s &quot;Amerika&quot;, and an excuse to see his cast and crew at work. And in between, actors from the &quot;youth part&quot; connect with the real world filmed in documentary (sometimes mockumentary) style. And then Mastroianni makes his entrance, dressed like Mandrake, a fitting disguise as once he pops up in the screen, we get to the most magical moment of the film, the one that allows it to proudly levitates above a material which, as rich and colorful as it is, is something we get a little bit used with -if not tired of- with Fellini. The problem with &quot;Intervista&quot; comes from the lack of a clearly defined perspective, unlike &quot;Ginger and Fred&quot;, it can get too distracting for its own good.\n\nThere&apos;s one recurring theme though, quoting the Maestro, the film was conceived like a long private and friendly chat about film-making, it&apos;s Fellini talking about movies with his troop, his loyal friends and guiding the conversation and its vignette-like episodes the way he feels it. It&apos;s a passionate love letter to cinema and Cine Cita in its unveiling of the sideshow as essential a part as the show.In reality it&apos;s the sideshow of his own life we&apos;re plunged into. I guess the film has the most pretentious premise but maybe Fellini can get away with it, because he&apos;s got quite an eloquence when he talks about himself and such an aesthetic approach to life, such a smart use of circus-like or melancholic music that I enjoyed it to a certain degree. I&apos;m not sure I was as enthralled as I expected to be, maybe the film drags too long on needless parts, and wrapped up in his own artistic creation, Fellini didn&apos;t feel the need to trim in the raw material. The part with the Natives attack for instance and the ensuing chaos kind of reminded me of the chaotic ending of Mel Brook&apos;s &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, but I&apos;m not sure it changed anything at all, after the Anita and Marcello part, the curtain would have found a perfect moment to close.\n\nBut I guess even the most unexpected moments speak for the way Fellini looked at his four-decade spanning career at that time, every movie could be his last and so he tried to push the envelope every time even further, not using inspiration to make movies but making movies about his inspiration. It&apos;s pretentious all right but if cinema was his life, there&apos;s no reason he couldn&apos;t regard his life as cinema, maybe his genius comes from his impossibility to dissociate cinema and reality, cinema was his reality, and to understand the reality of Fellini, the director, the artist and the man, watch his films, Fellini was also his best biographer.",

      "reviewBody": "Shiver-me-timbers, this is the best version of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic! In fact it is a model of cinematic adaptation. Closely following the book, with whole scenes and dialogue taken straight from its pages, the film never bogs down into the kind of stuffy lifelessness that sometimes afflicts adaptations attempting to be faithful to their literary source. Indeed Frazier Heston&apos;s screenplay and direction capture the brisk, page turning pleasure of the book nicely. Add to his sure direction, wonderful locations, a picture-perfect cast and a rousing music score by the Chieftains and you have one of the best pirate movies ever made. And for once they really are pirates and not watered down, sentimentalized versions of them. They&apos;re cut-throats all, a scurvy lot of thieves, superstitious and dirty. You can just smell their stench under the hot tropic sun and lush vegetation of Skeleton Island. \n\nOliver Reed as Billy Bones gets the movie going smartly. We first see him with his granite visage at the head of the skiff, an old sea dog home from the sea. With his great hulk and whiskey whisper purr he exudes danger from every rum soaked pore of his being. Of course his old shipmates, the remnants of the crew of the now dead Captain Flint, are pursuing him. Christopher Lee, almost completely unrecognizable, is Blind Pew, a spectral, skeletal figure of death, whose fury, fueled by blindness is like some great ravaging bird of prey. He is wonderful and like Reed he creates a vivid, memorable characterization. A young Christian Bale is the definitive Jim Hawkins. He narrates the proceedings and is at turns appealing, capable and wily. He is a boy on the verge of young manhood who is about to have his mettle tested with the adventure of a lifetime. There is not a trace of the Jackie Cooper mawkishness about him. Richard Johnson as Squire Trelawney, Julian Glover as Dr. Livesey, and Clive Wood as Captain Smollet are all perfect in their roles. They beautifully capture the essence of quiet courage. Heroes without phony heroics, they are solid men of character sure of themselves and quite capable of dealing with Silver and his scurvy crew.\n\nThis brings us to Charlton Heston as Long John Silver. Ultimately for any version of this work to succeed it rests on the shoulder of the actor portraying the Sea Cook. Happy to say, Heston gives one of the best performances of his long career. Turning his stalwart, forthright screen persona on its head, he creates a monster that is complex, charismatic, and bloodthirsty. There is no Wallace Beery, Robert Newton sentimentality here. This is a natural leader of men who can dazzle with his bigger than life personality and tales of treasure, and the next moment plunge his cutlass into the bowels of his victim without even missing a beat. Never has he used his toothy smile to better effect. It is the smile of a vicious carnivore-a shark. On a lighter note Nicholas Amer brings the right balance of levity and pathos as Ben Gunn, the poor maroon. He is amusing without becoming a caricature, and his scene with Jim when describes his yearning for a piece of toasted cheese is wonderful. Both Pete Postlewaite as George Merry and Michael Halsey as Israel Hands are perfectly nasty. \n\nFinally the music score by the Chieftains is superb. It captures by turns the lilting Celtic love of the sea, the grace and sweep of a great sailing ship setting out for adventure and the exotic dangers of buried treasure, pirates, flashing cutlasses, and midnight rendezvous on a far away island in the balmy tropics. Avast, me hearties, this is a film to treasure!",

They camp in a remote area far north where Saiva believes they will be safe and survive fishing and hunting reindeer and small animals. Their lives change when Saiva finds Loki (Sean Bean), a frozen stranger that is dying in the ice. Saiva brings him to their tent and recalls when she met her boyfriend and his tribe; how soviet soldiers have slaughtered them and raped her; and how she rescued Anja and killed the aggressors. When Loki is recovered, he and Anja fall in love with each other, affecting her relationship with Anja.\n\nThe independent &quot;Far North&quot; is a disturbing and frightening movie about curse and love. The story is open regarding the location and time, but is an excellent study of solitude and human behavior. The landscapes and locations in Svalbard are wonderfully shot and the performances are top notch. The unexpected conclusion is scary. The &quot;Making Of&quot; on the DVD is a must-see. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): Not Available",

The story of the film is very predictable. Its about this guy Bujji and girl Chitti who are looking for each other after getting separated during their teens. Okay, the story doesn&apos;t have to be all great for a commercial movie, but if it hardly entertains, whats the point? For the first time (second, if u also include Chirutha) in any of Puri Jagannadh&apos;s movies, Ali fails to make the audience laugh. The only thing that I found entertaining in this film are some dialogues. Thats the only department where Puri never fails. Other than that, the cast was OK. Trisha wasn&apos;t so glamorous, in my opinion. Sanjana didn&apos;t have much screen time. Mohan Babu tried to pull off Srihari&apos;s character from &quot;Dhee&quot;. Cinematography was definitely not good. The lighting just isn&apos;t good in 90% of the scenes. The VFX in &quot;Love Me&quot; song is a bit annoying.\n\nOverall, this kind of movie can only be watched once, if you have NOTHING ELSE TO DO!!",

      "reviewBody": "People call a 976 &quot;party line&quot; to talk dirty to strangers, and perhaps meet up for a sexual liason. A deranged, somewhat incestuous sister and occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they don&apos;t discriminate! A pair of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun, pretending to be older, of course. One of them works as a babysitter for a married man who&apos;s hot for her (or anyone).\n\nMeanwhile, a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he&apos;s the first to discover one of the siblings&apos; victims. He&apos;s teamed with a female assistant of the District Attorney.\n\nNothing too special here. Richard Roundtree has little more than a cameo as the police chief. One of the dirty-talking sixteen year olds is played by an actress who also voiced Peanuts character Peppermint Patty! According to the IMDb, the other died quite young, just several years after this movie: sad.",

It&apos;s absolutely gorgeous to see Tom Hanks&apos; performance - that&apos;s real acting, it requires a lot to play this part as genuinely and cordial as he did. The message is so clear and so honest. The nostalgic edge is of such profound significance to the story. It&apos;s about the differences between being a kid and being an adult. It&apos;s about two very different perceptions of the same world that surrounds us. It&apos;s just us and how we make the best out of every day of our lives, and all it needs is to see the world through the eyes of a kid. A kid perceives all the things differently, with much more native and modest simplicity - the keystone to imagination and magic, the keystone to cherish the daily miracles in our lives. This movie has a deep and very pervasive message. It has so much charm and vitality mingled with nostalgia and witchcraft. One of those movies I enjoyed watching when I was a kid. Recommended.",

So what is the status of these walking, talking exhibits anyway? They seem somewhere in between automatons, which can move but don&apos;t have personalities, and &quot;real&quot; humans, who are always animated, not just at night. The solution, I think, is to consider the Opening of the Mouth Ritual, especially given the movie&apos;s ancient Egyptian thematics. That involved animating a statue with the soul of the departed. So the Teddy Roosevelt statue, for example, would be possessed by the soul of Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nWe enjoyed that this took place in the Smithsonian, as we were planning to visit D. C. for the Cherry Blossom festival. Then COVID-19 happened!\n\nSeb&apos;s rating: 7 stars Sienna&apos;s rating: 7stars Paul&apos;s rating: 7 stars.",

Spending so much time on the Chess family and their record label, especially with an unquestioning air of glorification feels a bit awkward and repetitive. I&apos;m glad I saw it, but I would rather of seen a lot more of the performers, and a lot less of Marshall Chess talking himself up. \n\nOr I would have been happy to see a much more incisive, objective look at the double edged ways white record labels both helped and exploited their artists. But this ends up in no man&apos;s land, leaving me unsure of it&apos;s point, or point of view. \n\nNone-the-less, a can&apos;t miss for the fan, for the performances themselves.",

      "reviewBody": "Is it merely a cultural thing that did not allow me the illusion that this film seeks to portray? Having visited India I know that this movie displays a very tiny facade of what Indians think would be appealing about their fascinating country. The Bollywood film _Ek Dhun Banaras Kee_(qv) never leaves the realm of comely mass entertainment.\n\nSo in great wonderment I saw only the most beautiful facades of the oldest holy city on river Ganges, a sadly polluted river shown here as clean as a mountain stream. There is no reality street life in this movie, we are forced into the unreal world of a film as if ordered by the city&apos;s Tourist Development Agency.\n\n&apos;Ashmit Patel&apos;(qv)&apos;s pretty-boy face is directed like a south-American music video with all smiles and no substance. There was no acting demanded of him. He would do well selling deodorant in France.\n\nThe story wants to be spiritually deep and socially conscious by juxtaposing two stylized lovers from different castes. The potential conflict are undramatically produced, after we are given about twenty minutes of showing the couple at Banares&apos; famous temples and river banks, looking at each other in unspontaneously staged settings that really irks everyone who want to be swept away by a movie&apos;s illusions instead of watching a long toothpaste or chewing gum commercial. This is a good travel promotion or a boring music video, and one can only wonder what audience it was made for. If it is shown to Indians, they must be proud of a movie of aesthetic beauty that shows their country without problems, except the unfortunate castes system. Shown to western audiences it become a romantic travel film, and as we have seen, accepted both quite favorably by IMDb users of Indian decent and Westerners alike.\n\nBesides a cast of pretty people --even Babaji the spiritual teacher floats about with the neatest beard and most perfect robes in white and red-- the film wants to teach basic Hindi and Buddhistic values. It even forewarns its audiences at the beginning that it does not want to promote superstitions, but in almost every scene the accoutrement of superstitious beliefs are shown: ornaments, mystic sculptures, flower petals strewn about, chants and incense. Even the character played by the beautiful &apos;Urmila Matondkar&apos;(qv) indulges in dreamy superstitious rituals. I respect all belief systems, but if a director forewarns of something he is supposedly not wanting to promote, and we see it all over his film, we have a choice to either believe that he does not notice ritualistic superstitions any longer due to his cultural blindness, or that he really beliefs that his message has transgressed superstition. And it is exactly this message that one would have liked not to see running into sturdy road blocks.\n\nNamely the endeavor to transgress a banal and forbidden love story without careful exposition, and fall into the trap of cinematographically created ambiance that actually overpowers the actors. Pretty pictures are nice if you can not travel to the heart of the holy city, but in this case the story suffers and certainly takes away from the filmmakers ambitions.\n\nAnd the story is the age-old apparent conflict between science and religion. Do we get enough information and exposition to learn something new, or even care to contemplate this important topic? No. Is Banares well photographed? Yes, the parts that are devoid of real street life and real people, who normally bring life to the temples. Is there a tension between the lovers? No. Are we happy for them falling in love because we feel their hearts? No. Is the parent-child, castes conflict melodrama powerful enough to move us? No. Are age-old chants well produced like a music video? Yes, excellently. Does the movie do justice to the promos and hype about the alleged conflict of religious beliefs and modern science, or its presentations of the philosophy of love or even as found in romantic love? Nothing deep there. Is the storytelling moving the film forward? No, it stops too often to dwell on its on pretty pretensions.\n\nIt&apos;s eye candy at best, and the two protagonists do not connect except as another daft acting job. The dying dad at the beginning gives much story away, but even he looked pretty healthy as if there was no make-up designer on duty that day. Melodrama, yes. Sizzling love and real drama over the lingering castes system and parental cultural fossilization, no.",

And in this version Harpagon is played by the extremely funny Louis de Funès, which, as usual, shines. The original script has not been touched, so it may be hard for some to get into the movie, and since the sets are minimal, a little imagination is required. But if you get into it, you&apos;ll have fun. The cast is good, but the play is centered around Harpagon and Louis de Funès is absolutely perfect for that role. This is a comedy as in comedy at the time of Molière. At this time, a comedy was a play thats IS NOT a tragedy, meaning it does not have a sad ending, so don&apos;t expect a laugh-out-loud comedy. One thing that I don&apos;t like about this play/movie is the end. But this movie is still worth your time, even if it is just to introduce you to Molière.\n\n75%",

      "reviewBody": "Apart from his gifts as writer/director, Claude Sautet possessed the ability to reinvent himself. A gap of five years ensued after the disappointing &apos;Guns for the Dictator&apos; and nothing could prepare us for the miracle that is &apos;Les Choses de ma Vie.&apos; This ushered in an extraordinarily rich phase during which he formed close relationships with, amongst others, the wondrous Romy Schneider(undoubtedly his muse) Yves Montand and Michel Piccoli, as well as having the immeasurable support of writer Jean-Loup Dabadie and composer Philippe Sarde. A complete change of tack came with the austere &apos;Mauvais Fils&apos; with Patrick Dewaere. Devastated by the deaths of Romy Schneider and Dewaere, he again re-tuned his strings and resumed five years later with three understated and beautifully constructed films, the last of which is an undisputed masterpiece.\n\nThe question here of course is where does &apos;Garcon&apos; fit into the scheme of things? It is certainly not a great film, least of all by Sautet&apos;s standards and is one most likely to be forgotten. It was the only one of his output, apart from his first, &apos;Bonjour Sourire&apos;, which no one seems to have seen(!) not to be included in the BFI&apos;s retrospective of a few years back.\n\nIt is lightweight to be sure but is both touching and appealing, mainly due to the presence of Yves Montand. He and Sautet had obviously clicked from the outset and although this is by far the least of the three films they made together, Montand&apos;s performance as a not-so-young waiter whose philosophy regarding women seems to be &apos;Service est compris&apos;, is one of his most beguiling, endearing and yes, enchanting. Colourful characters abound and the camerawork, especially in the restaurant scenes, is superlative. Being a Sautet film there is of course a certain melancholy and a realisation that relationships are ephemeral, especially those of the male/female variety.\n\nThis is not one of the works by which Sautet will be remembered but his last two critically acclaimed films guarantee that he went out with a bang, not a whimper.\n\nAs for M. Montand, whilst on his way to hospital following a heart attack that proved to be fatal, he reportedly said: &quot;I&apos;m a gonna but I&apos;ve had a hell of a life!&apos; A major part of his life was shared with audiences and we are indeed fortunate to have made his acquaintance.",

      "reviewBody": "Filmed for showing as a TV Movie of the Week in the US and as a supporting feature in UK cinemas, this utilized the talents of several former Avengers personnel, director Sidney Hayers, writer Philip Levene, Laurie Johnson with an unmistakable score and Julian Wintle producing. Trademark fast-moving direction of the action scenes from Hayers, with no time wasted on people getting in and out of cars for example. The quirky character played by Roy Kinnear is very Avengers, in fact he&apos;d played similar types in the show. A last appearance from 1930&apos;s leading man John Loder, while surprising to see the smooth Allan Cuthbertson, usually seen as one of the officer class, as a firefighter. Not too difficult to guess the identity of the arsonist, but the fires are relatively convincing, though how the hero and heroine emerged with barely singeing their eyebrows is anyone&apos;s guess. Good undemanding entertainment nevertheless.",

      "reviewBody": "Personal Note: I dubbed Charles in the Dutch version of Coco Ferme! Hi, I&apos;m Felix, and it&apos;s really fun to see pages like this! I know it&apos;s not a big movie, but it is for me because it&apos;s my first-ever movie!\n\n&quot;Coco Farm&quot; takes us on a journey with twelve-year-old Max as he navigates the challenges of small-scale farming in a quaint country town. Forced to shut down his garage-based pawn shop due to financial struggles, Max, along with his cousin Charles and local YouTuber Alice, embarks on an entrepreneurial adventure to start an egg farming business in Charles&apos;s aging barn.\n\nThe film captures the essence of a small community coming together to create something meaningful. The concept of Coco Farm, an animal-friendly venture, adds a touch of charm to the storyline. As the business gains popularity, the trio encounters the harsh realities of an industry dominated by mega-sized agribusinesses.\n\nNow, about the movie itself:\n\nThe narrative sheds light on the struggles faced by individuals trying to carve a niche in an industry overshadowed by corporate giants. The contrast between the warmth of the local farming community and the challenges posed by larger agricultural corporations provides an interesting backdrop for the story.\n\nThe characters, especially Max, Charles, and Alice, bring a relatable and down-to-earth quality to the film. Their camaraderie and determination add a layer of authenticity to the plot. While &quot;Coco Farm&quot; may not be a groundbreaking cinematic experience, it offers a pleasant and straightforward tale with a valuable lesson about the realities of the farming industry.\n\nIn summary, &quot;Coco Farm&quot; is a light-hearted exploration of entrepreneurship, community spirit, and the challenges faced by small-scale farmers. It&apos;s a film that resonates with simplicity, making it an enjoyable watch for those looking for a feel-good story with a dose of reality.",

This is a heavy handed anti-abortion morality lesson. It is heavy on guilt, sobbing, nightmares over an abortion, Catholic images of scary demon gravestones, while trying to justify the rightness of it with Catholic church interiors &amp; icons, a priest, a pale cold corpse &amp; a heavy ton of guilty torment to ram the anti-abortion message into your brain like a rusty metal stake in a scary Catholic graveyard. NOT at all appropriate for family viewing!! (unless you want you want your kids mentally twisted &amp; permanently neurotic, fearful &amp; hating you forever). Appropriate only for catechism scare/guilt lessons. Beating yourself and wearing a hair shirt for being a sinner would be more of an upper than watching this. Honestly I worry for the mental stability of kids being forced to watch this guilt &amp; fear producing film, at any time of year, but it will ruin their Christmas experience forever.",

      "name": "Misadventure and romance in the heyday of air travel",
      "reviewBody": "By the 21st century, air travel had become so common that it was almost passé. Flying somewhere for business or to visit relatives had become ho-hum. While vacation flights may still carry a little excitement, for the most part air travel is now so common that there&apos;s nothing special about it. And, considering the changes and difficulties with travel today, modern folk can be excused if they don&apos;t know about a time when air travel was fun, relaxing, exciting and even romantic. But there was such a time, indeed. \n\nThe glamor days of air travel were the late 1950s to the early 1980s. Air travel grew by leaps and bounds after World War II as jet airplanes cut flight time to a couple hours between airports in most countries. In America, cities large and small had multiple airlines serving them. People enjoyed travel for business, pleasure and family visits. Vacation packages frequently included air travel or were built around it by the airlines. And security measures were simple and quick to get through. Many airlines flourished during this time. I have flown on every major carrier in the U.S. since 1962, and on several foreign airlines. And, I&apos;ve flown on most of the U.S. regional or trunk lines as well and smaller airlines in Europe and Asia. \n\nThe first three decades of jet air service were the halcyon days of air travel. Airlines then competed for passengers with service. The cream of the crop of the American-based airlines were Pan Am (Pan American World Airways), Braniff International and TWA (Trans World Airlines). Running close behind them in service were United, American, and Eastern airlines. Other national carriers were Delta, Northwestern, Continental and National. Travelers will recognize that all but three of those were gone within a decade into the 21st century, and that some new airlines have been added. The cream of the regional carriers back then was Alaska Airlines – today one of the major carriers in the U.S. \n\nSo, why do I bother giving this brief history of U.S. airline service? I think it may help younger movie fans especially to get in the mood of this film, &quot;Come Fly with Me.&quot; This film shows a little of the meal and drink service on the airlines of the past (and that international flights still provide), and the hospitality of the airline employees. In those days, women were stewardesses and men were stewards. Today they have no gender distinction and are called flight attendants. But it also is an example of a type of film that was popular for that period when many people associated flying with romantic getaways or just plain romance. So, in the style of the day, three of the flight hostesses are friends who enjoy travel to foreign ports and hope to meet well-to-do men. And, the co-pilot has a role that was typical for films of this period genre – as a flyer with a girl in every port. \n\nEnough said on that. &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot; puts a different twist on the usual fare for the women and the co-pilot. Dolores Hart, Pamela Tiffin, Lois Nettleton, Hugh O&apos;Brian and the rest of the cast play their parts well. I especially enjoyed Karl Malden as Walter Lucas and Lois Maxwell as Gwen Sandley. Watch for the misadventure involving Hart&apos;s character and a traveling baron who catches her eye. \n\nThis is a light comedy romance that is worth watching besides just for its historical view of the travel culture of the time.",

      "reviewBody": "Most of the other comments here about this movie are correct, but they dance around the central issue, I think. But first . . .\n\nFirst: the acting here is superb. I had to remind myself I wasn&apos;t watching a documentary.\n\nSecond: the cinematography is unusual and highly effective. It&apos;s a certain style that other directors have used (some Japanese guy, for example, whose name escapes me.) Someone here describes it as minimalist, and maybe it is, but it has the effect of putting you in the scene as a sort of innocent bystander. For example, the camera does not always follow the action; rather, it is stationary and the characters pass back and forth. Sometimes they drift off screen, or almost off screen, right in the middle of a scene. In this particular case, it works to great effect. It&apos;s as if you&apos;re sitting on the couch, ignored, slightly embarrassed, taking it all in.\n\nOK, now for the story. This is a story about sex, women, and men, in its most elemental form. Sex for money, or barter, whatever. Sex for cheap thrills. But mostly, this is about the way that men use women, and IN PARTICULAR how Israeli men relate to women. That&apos;s the crux of it, because this film was not shot in Argentina, or Kenya, or Thailand, but in the (so-called) Holy Land. 50 years after the establishment of the state of Israel, once referred to as the Moral Vacation Spot of the World, we see a society which is blatantly exploitive of women. No moral compass here. We get the landlord who cops a feel for the rent. A soldier on leave from the West Bank who demands a blow job. Drunks in the street humping an aging whore. An ex husband who couldn&apos;t care less that his former wife walks the streets. This is gritty stuff to see in the land of Jesus &amp; Co.\n\nSo, not a fun movie -- leaves you feeling like you just took a nap on the floor of a Greyhound terminal -- but if you&apos;re up for well done realism, this is for you.\n\nP.S. Lots of nudity, and sex, but don&apos;t expect to get turned on; it&apos;s more like watching an xxx flick from inside the porn star&apos;s head.\n\nP.P.S. (Written much later) If you&apos;re up for another interesting look at Israeli sexuality, there&apos;s a documentary called (I think) The First Zionist Bunny. It&apos;s about how Playboy selected a host for their cable channel in Israel. Very interesting flick.",

That is &quot;Stone Cold&quot;. It never tries to be more than what it is. It has a simple setup far as story goes, decent action, it&apos;s well shot, has fast pacing, and pretty solid acting all around.\n\nIt&apos;s an early 90&apos;s movie about a cop going undercover to catch a biker gang, what more are you expecting out of this?\n\nEnjoy!"

      "reviewBody": "Based on the true-life of Col. Benjamin H. Grierson and a real incident during American Civil War ; it deals with a Union Cavalry army is sent behind confederate lines in strength to destroy a rail/supply post. Along with them is sent a pacifist medic (William Holden, the producers originally wanted Clark Gable for the leading role) who causes instant antipathy between him and the commander-in-chief (John Wayne). As Union Colonel leads sabotage party deep into rebel territory and carries out attacks ans contra-attacks , being accompanied by the doctor who heals wounded people . The secret plan for the mission is overheard by a southern woman (Constance Towers) who must be taken along to assure her silence . The actual deeds are the followings : In the Spring of 1863, Grierson left bases in northern Mississippi, taking 1,700 troopers with him. The film is based on the true raid by Col. Benjamin Grierson who, as shown in the movie, began his expedition--known as Grierson&apos;s Raid--from LeGrange, Tennessee, in April of 1863. Grierson &quot;drove through central Mississippi, tearing up railroads and upsetting Confederate General Pemberton&apos;s troop deployments before reaching Union-held Baton Rouge.\n\nThis is the following to trilogy cavalry : ¨She Wore a Yellow Ribbon , Rio Grande , Fort Apache¨ , and including glorification of military life , drama , love and sentimental nostalgia with interesting character studio of a varied assortment of individuals . It was considered a minor job , however this classic picture nowadays ranks as one of the best of John Ford&apos;s work . It contains Ford&apos;s usual themes as good feeling , a little bit of enjoyable humor , friendship and and sense of comradeship among people . Interesting screenplay portraying in depth characters and brooding events with interesting issues running beneath script surface . Spectacular scenes as when the Confederate troops spontaneously attack the town in its last stand and when takes place the final confrontation on the besieged location , surrounding the bridge . The film marked the beginning of mega-deals for Hollywood stars , as John Wayne and William Holden received $775,000 each, plus 20% of the overall profits, an unheard-of sum for that time . The film , however , was a financial failure, with no profits to be shared in the end. Excellent film featuring a magnificent performance by whole casting . Awesome John Wayne in a larger-than-life character along with William Holden. Enticing and intimate Constance Towers in an enjoyable role , giving a sensational acting . Agreeable co-starring cast, as in the movie appears all habitual Ford&apos;s friends as Hoot Gibson as Sgt. Brown , Ken Curtis as Cpl. Wilkie , Willis Bouchey as Col. Phil Secord ,Hank Worden as Deacon and Strother Martin as Virgil . Good cinematography by William H. Clothier , John Ford&apos;s usual , reflecting splendidly marvelous outdoors .Vivid score by David Buttolph and including an emotive military parade of the boys academy .\n\nThe movie was stunningly written and produced by John Lee Mahin and Martin Rackin ; of course , magnificently filmed by Ford , being John Ford&apos;s only feature film set during the Civil War, although he did direct a segment of ¨How the West Was Won¨ that was set during the Civil War . Director Ford suggested the scene with the boys&apos; military academy, and according to the producers, he ad-libbed it . Rating : Better than average worthwhile watching .",

      "reviewBody": "Cheap, sure. Corman --- of course. But not the usual fare, not even for the King of the B&apos;s. Here&apos;s the backstory: Corman was in Europe shooting another feature and supposedly entered into a co-production deal with another company. At the last moment his co-producers pulled out and took their money with them. Now Corman had two choices: abandon the project, or shoot the script he had for half the money he&apos;d budgeted. Which did he choose? Well, the movie got made didn&apos;t it? Screenwriter Charles Griffith had also written LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and originally wanted to call this movie ATLAS, THE GUIDED MUSCLE, but Corman nixed that. So we get Steve Forrest (who also played Apollo on a STAR TREK episode) as a slightly malnourished looking Atlas, standing around with a bunch of extras in Greek costumes (including Griffith and Corman himself), looking around at the &quot;grandeur&quot; of ancient Greece, a bunch of the crumbling ruins which the villain explains away by saying &quot;Well, we&apos;ve been at war so long all the buildings have been demolished&quot; or something like that. I&apos;m not going to pretend this is a GOOD movie, but it&apos;s a great example of the unstoppable Corman machine in action."

      "reviewBody": "This is benchmark-quality drama, a two-hour film retelling of the lives (and deaths) of Henry VII&apos;s wives that uses much the same cast and crew as a previous six-hour BBC miniseries.\n\nAs a film, it&apos;s pretty much unbeatable and sets a standard of high quality that few others can match. Sets, costumes and backdrop are all superb, but of course the real strengths lie in the script and the calibre of acting. Keith Michell stars in a role he was born to play, never less than authentic whether he&apos;s playing Henry as an athletic young man or as an obese ancient. He also manages to make the tyrant deeply human, which is another string to his bow.\n\nWith the full story of the six wives crammed into a two-hour time slot, the pacing is fast and the script full of drama. Some of the wives fare better than others, but highlights include Charlotte Rampling&apos;s witchy Anne Boleyn and Lynne Frederick&apos;s captivating innocent, Catherine Howard. Filling the supporting cast with familiar, entertaining figures like Michael Gough, Donald Pleasence and Brian Blessed is another plus.\n\nMost of all, though, I found this retelling succeeded far better in bringing to life the era than others - check out the terrible THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL for a good comparison. We learn much about politics, entertainment and religion of the era, but it&apos;s never told in a dry or heavy way. Unbeatable? Yes, I think this is.",

In &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; he shows why he was probably the man that was born to direct this film, as well as others of the genre. This is a remake of the film of 1935, which had been a vehicle for Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor.\n\nJane Wyman and Rock Hudson seemed to be unlikely candidates for playing a romantic couple in the movies. After all, Ms. Wyman was older than Mr. Hudson and clearly appeared to be in the film. The story, which is based on LLoyd Douglas novel, has a little bit of everything.\n\n&quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; proved to be a hit for its stars. In a way, it&apos;s easy to see why fans were attracted to it, with its many twists and turns and the impossible love between Helen and Dr. Bob Merrick, the playboy who becomes contrite after he causes the accident that makes Helen blind. Also in the cast the magnificent Agnes Moorehead, who has great moments in the film.",

      "reviewBody": "I have read the reviews complaining about that Dario has abandoned his style and all the gore to produce a tame TV-thriller. Far from the truth, according to me! I really think that this is the best he has done since &quot;Opera&quot;. Granted, his stylish touch might seem to be muted compared to the baroque thriller of the 70s and 80s, but this cold and bleak atmosphere that he conjures up this time along with very brightly lit camera-work for most of the scenes, is something I enjoyed throughout! Sure, the gore is almost totally absent (apart from one scene), but as a whole this picture is much more efficiently done. The pace is fluent and unlike most of his other movies, there is actually no point where the characters just stand around and talk (and sometimes his players have been involved in some truly atrocious conversation) to fill out the time.\n\n*MINOR SPOILER* And in &quot;Il cartaio&quot; the three main actors are actually very good! They are people you can care about and when they are in danger or die, you feel sorry for them. *END OF SPOILER* Like I mentioned before, I enjoyed the bleak look of the movie...as always classy camera-work in every frame of an Argento picture! And Claudio Simonetti&apos;s score is his best in years even though you might be just a little bit tired of it by the time the movie reaches it&apos;s conclusion. And talking about the finale, I found it both interesting, but at the same time also maybe a little bit of a letdown. However, the endings have been a bit weak lately in Dario&apos;s films. Not since &quot;Tenebrae&quot; has there been a really powerful conclusion. And two minor complaints finally...it was too easy to guess who the killer was. This has been mentioned before and I think it is true. The killer&apos;s identity could have been better camouflaged without a &quot;certain scene&quot; (you will know which one). And the card scenes went on too long on two occasions. The constant screaming from the victims became annoying in these scenes and I almost wanted them to die just to make them shut up! Otherwise, his best work in years and a film where he is not just content with repeating an old formula (like in &quot;Sleepless&quot; which I liked anyhow), but is actually trying to find a whole new path in his art.",

      "reviewBody": "6 December 2010. A year before the more quirky comedy drama PUSHING TIN (1999) came out starring John Cusack and Billy Bob Thorton, the more mainstream disaster thriller GROUND CONTROL was released starring television&apos;s 24 Keifer Sutherland with co-starring roles for 1986&apos;s Kelly McGillis (TOP GUN, 1986) and Kristy Swanson (FERRIS BUELLER&apos;S DAY OFF). GROUND CONTROL is relatively traditional, predictable, interestingly in a way less sensationalized, dramatized than PUSHING TIN and less relational and more focused fascinating active air control dynamics which in some ways makes this more watchable than average dramatic thrillers. **Added January 9, 2012 - With a decent storyline that keeps building, this is good entertainment. What makes this dramatic thriller on solid ground is its use of stereotypes but in a way that never overextends their use, the irritated man&apos;s eventual response to the babies, the way the ending wasn&apos;t as pat as most dramatic endings are with its more realistic and, literally, twists and turns, and even the non-verbal exchanges at the end make for a believable and satisfying landing.**",

It seems to be an infernal machine that makes gold, or salt, or flour, or something but whatever it does, everybody wants it and will go to any lengths to build one. This Scandanavian film has an unusual look to it but it appears that the print is faded, hence the washed out look. Or maybe it&apos;s because of all the snow and ice. But I must admit that I found it rather fascinating.\n\nThe lead actors play it pretty much without emotion except for the witch who is a total pain in the butt. It took me a while to figure out if it was a man or a woman; regardless he/she was irritating. It moves along pretty slowly and there are times when it is difficult to figure out exactly what is going on.....that may be due to the terrible dubbing. I hate dubbing.....give me sub-titles anytime.\n\nThe ending with the harps is insane. We should advise our military that harp music can be deadly and is a lot less messy than live ammunition. However, there is something rather endearing about this film that makes it worth watching. Of course, you need to see the MST3K version.... it is a lot more fun. Can you say Sampo?"

      "reviewBody": "Sid Boggle (Sid James) and his friend Bernie Lugg (Bernard Bresslaw) hatch a plan to take their girlfriends, Joan Fussey (Joan Sims) and Anthea Meeks (Dilys Laye), to a nudist campsite called Paradise. However, when they get there it&apos;s not the paradise they envisaged, full of odd balls and bad British weather, things only perk up when a coach load of girls turn up. Trouble is, the guys must get shot of their girlfriends first.\n\nOddly, Carry On Camping is a film that is revered by the series fans yet frowned upon by critics. Plot wise I&apos;m inclined to agree with the critics, it&apos;s as basic as can be and is nothing other than a series of vignettes weaved together to create a lurid camping based holiday film. Tis true, but hell the comedy is good here, smutty and awash with innuendo and making the most of the double meaning of the word camping. It&apos;s also one of the series best roll calls as regards its cast, most of the big hitters are here, it&apos;s easier to just say Jim Dale and Kenneth Connor are the two notable absentees.\n\nFrom the sight of Barbara Windsor&apos;s bra shooting thru the air, to the hapless Terry Scott having buck shot removed from his posterior, Camping has no other intentions other than to titter the discerning Carry On fan. What often gets forgotten tho, is just what great comedy actors some of these series regulars were, witness here a sequence in a tent as Terry Scott, Charles Hawtrey and Betty Marsden attempt to get ready for bed, comedy gold. So one for fans only it seems, hooray for me then because I love Carry On Camping, always have, always will. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "This 61 minute sequel begins with roughly about 10 minutes of stock footage from the previous film (THE MUMMY&apos;S HAND), but it should be taken into account that these first two Universal installments were released a couple of years apart back in their day, and it was during a time in our history when we didn&apos;t have the luxury of television, much less &quot;home video&quot;. Today we can watch these films over and over, and back to back; but in the early &apos;40s it wouldn&apos;t have been so easy to recall where the story of Kharis the mummy left off two whole years ago, and that&apos;s in the context that this repetitive footage should be considered. \n\nAfter being refreshed of the last films&apos; Egyptian exploits of novice archaeologists Steve Banning and Babe Jenson (now mistakenly referred to as Babe &quot;Hanson&quot;, an error which is NOT as easily excusable!) we move ahead 30 years where the mummy of Kharis (newly played by Lon Chaney) is stuck in America with current high priest Mehemet Bey (Turhan Bey). Why it&apos;s taken so long is anyone&apos;s guess, but Mehemet now has a vengeance mission to unleash the mummy on Steve and Babe (Dick Foran and Wallace Ford, reprising their parts in senior citizen&apos;s makeup) for daring to defile Kharis&apos; tomb three decades earlier. \n\nThis is strictly a &quot;B&quot; level programmer without many trimmings, but it&apos;s still a fairly entertaining one . Lon Chaney looks menacing in his ravaged mummy outfit which properly shows some of the effects of the fire which consumed him once upon a time. Chaney absolutely hated playing the restrictive part of Kharis, yet he wound up grumbling through it for two more sequels following this one. Harold Young&apos;s pedestrian direction is nothing much to get excited about, but we do get some chilling sequences of Kharis creeping around modern-day Mapleton, Massachusetts on dark and windy evenings, which are a plus. Turhan Bey is perfectly cast as the mummy&apos;s foreign protector, and lovely Elyse Knox is easy on the eyes as the pretty love interest to John Hubbard, who doesn&apos;t leave much impression as Steve Banning&apos;s son. One can nitpick on the inconsistency of these mummy sequels forever; for example, even though TOMB occurs thirty years after HAND and should therefore be set in 1970, everyone still dresses and acts like it&apos;s 1942. But what the hell -- taken for what it is, THE MUMMY&apos;S TOMB is a fast and fulfilling hour of mindless fun. \n\n**1/2 out of ****",

It is important to remember that for decades these two films were the only way in which to enjoy Harold&apos;s classics, as he was adamant that they would not be butchered by television.\n\nWe are shown Harold&apos;s shipboard confrontation with the villain and a romantic interlude in the woods from THE KID BROTHER (1927). Harold&apos;s desperate dash to his own wedding while in charge of a group of drunken bums is shown from FOR HEAVEN&apos;S SAKE (1926) and his taxi troubles in SPEEDY (1928) are included.\n\nAs a grand conclusion, we are treated to Harold&apos;s THE FRESHMAN (1925) in its entirety. This wonderfully funny look at a determined young fellow&apos;s drive to succeed on his college football team is still touchingly poignant. The inclusion of the song There Was a Boy, There Was A Girl&apos; by Ned Washington &amp; Walter Scharf lends a gentle, evocative touch to the movie.",

Through the lives and experiences of rural villagers who seek out and dismantle UXO to sell the scrap metal for profit, Bombhunters examines the social, cultural, and historical context of the legacy of war long after armed conflict has ended. Through the use of lipstick cameras as well as extensive fieldwork and interviews, Bombhunters profiles the experiences of individuals as they risk their lives to clear UXO from their land in order to both protect their families from harm and to make enough money to survive. The film also draws connections to other post-conflict nations around the world as their citizens continue to grapple with residual, persistent effects of war, and the complex realities of achieving &quot;peace.&quot;",

Kay is played by the young and beautiful Elizabeth Taylor, who had just been married for the first time in real life; and her intended is played by Don Taylor, an actor I haven&apos;t seen in anything else, and can&apos;t really remember doing anything of interest in this.  The family is completed by Joan Bennett as Tracy&apos;s wife, and Rusty (later Russ) Tamblyn as their youngest child.\n\nAlthough the movie does play up the comic potential of the wedding situation - the dad dreams of losing his trousers as he walks down the aisle, for example - it also has moments of poignancy, especially in the last few sequences where the parents dance together in the post-party mess of their once-pristine house.  This kind of thing puts the movie above the ordinary, and is exactly what was missing in the Steve Martin remake years later.\n\nAnd don&apos;t let me forget Billie Burke and Moroni Olsen as the groom&apos;s parents - really funny!"

I&apos;m sure everyone, at least once in their life, has wanted to be invisible, but how few of us really thought about the negative side effects?  This movie shows them.  Nick (played by Chevy Chase, whose great in a serious role,) gets turned invisible in a lab accident.  As soon as the CIA find out about this, they stop at nothing to obtain him.  And if they can&apos;t have them, no one can (including himself.) Although the film has a large amount of funny parts and an overall light tone, it isn&apos;t necessarily a comedy.  There is a serious over tone to it that makes it very interesting as well as funny and can be enjoyed almost purely for it&apos;s story line and insight on what it would really be like to be invisible. Definitely worth a look for anyone who&apos;s up for a good movie.",

      "reviewBody": "In the 2001 documentary &quot;Seth Eastman:Painting the Dakota&quot; Producer/Director Kristian Berg scores another notch in his belt with an interesting, informative and well done documentary about soldier/artist Seth Eastman whose collection and paintings depicting Dakota daily life and ceremonies in the mid-1800&apos;s, have been on the field of controversy as to their culturally accurate content for many years. Kristian has a certain diplomacy and knack for staying out of the politics of issues, which enables him to get deep into the heart of all sides of an issue. Well-known and liked in many Dakota communities and reservations, Dakotas always seem willing to work with him as he has a natural talent for letting people tell their own story on camera.\n\nThis documentary has already won the Bronze Wrangler award for Western style documentaries. See also &quot;Dakota Exile&quot; and &quot;Dakota Conflict&quot; two more excellent documentaries produced/directed by Kristian Berg on Dakota People and history.\n\nJay Red Hawk",

Acting, script, photography are not the best, but intentions make it for any shortcomings. In the 60&apos;s Steve Reeves was always the best choice for this kind of movies which rescue for the common viewer Greek Mythology in images, since reading these days on those topics is something of a dead matter for most people. Haven&apos;t heard lately anyone opining on Homer&apos;s books. Let&apos;s not forget that history is strongly involved and though historical events are quite distorted there&apos;s epic action along with mythological figures (Achilles) and real people (Ulyses). Although it can&apos;t be compared to the recent 2004 Brad Pitt Troy, it is more close to some real facts such as the death of Paris in situ and fact is that Paris never made it. At least, not alive. A must see for anyone who wants digested Greek Mythology and History, but why on earth ALL THE HERCULES MOVIES ARE RELEASED ON DVD IN 1.33:1 (pan and scan) AND NOT IN THEIR 2.35:1 ORIGINAL FORMAT? The magnitude of the battles and other details are unfortunately lost. It is an unfair mutilation which studios should and must avoid and repair in new DVD editions. Can one imagine Ben-Hur in 1.33:1 format? English dubbing is alright but having the option of Italian audio along with subtitles won&apos;t do any harm. I wonder if studios bother to read what their DVD buying customers have to say about the quality of their products.",

Diana&apos;s powerful and terrifying dreams begin to impact reality, and the two women begin to delve into the home&apos;s history and Jenny&apos;s connection to it.\n\nA relatively unknown British-set offering by American director Harley Cokeliss, &quot;Dream Demon&quot; is in the same league as a number of over-the-top supernatural horror films from the late 1980s, such as &quot;Night of the Demons,&quot; &quot;Mirror, Mirror,&quot; and &quot;Witchboard&quot; (the latter of which Kathleen Wilhoite, portraying Jenny here, also appeared in). The distinction with &quot;Dream Demon&quot; is that the film has a particularly English bent to it that borders on gothic at times.\n\nAnother distinguishing element here, and perhaps the film&apos;s most interesting feature, is that it toys with narrative quite cleverly as Diana&apos;s grasp on reality begins to tunnel in on itself, to the point that she (and eventually Jenny) cannot discern waking life from Diana&apos;s lethal slumber. There are elements redolent of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; in this case--Diana&apos;s dreams begin to impact her physical environment, endangering those around her (including a pair of crude journalists harassing her). Though not the most original idea, it is orchestrated nicely here, and keeps the viewer on their toes as the two characters venture through a topsy-turvy world.\n\nJemma Redgrave turns in a solid and understated performance here as the tormented Diana, and Kathleen Wilhoite offers a spunky performance as the mouthy California punkster who joins her. Things start to coalesce in the final act of the film, and the fragments from Diana&apos;s dreams begin to paint a picture of why the two women have been united in the first place. Though not really a twist per se, the revelation feels appropriate and I left the film satisfied despite a few loose ends.\n\nOverall, &quot;Dream Demon&quot; is worth a viewing for fans of late &apos;80s supernatural films, as it features a similar aesthetic and premise to its peers. The English bent adds a distinct flavor, while the screenplay is clever, if not entirely perfect. Recommended for genre fans. 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "It sucks that it takes the death of an actor to remind you that you still haven&apos;t watched something, but that&apos;s how it was with the passing of Bill Paxton, which reminded me that I still had somehow overlooked &quot;One False Move&quot;, despite wanting to see it since it came out, when Siskel and Ebert were raving about it for what seemed like months. \n\nThey were right to rave about it. &quot;One False Move&quot; is a tightly wound, taut, masterfully acted and powerfully suspenseful film. It&apos;s also written with a precision and level of realistic detail lacking in so many screenplays. I had forgotten, as I feel the entire world has, just how great of a writer Billy Bob Thornton was once upon a time. This might be his greatest screenplay, in fact. The plot (about three criminals fleeing L.A. after robbing and killing a drug dealer, heading to Arkansas to hide out) moves forward with the ruthless momentum of a shark, and with just as much bite. The opening is one of the most brutal sequences I&apos;ve seen in quite some time, and the violence that erupts in the rest of the film is just as brutal. Carl Franklin directs with a lean, muscular hand. The violence occurs as it seems to in reality, seemingly out of nowhere and with surprising impact. Every death hits with a hell of a punch, you feel virtually every stab and gunshot. The characters are drawn with a fascinating level of insight and detail, and every detail feels just right. Even the most violent and despicable of people in this movie is treated with respect and is intriguing, and we really get to know them and what makes them tick. Aside from the acts of violence, this movie is filled with powerfully rendered little moments that feel as natural as overhearing a conversation or catching up with an old friend. \n\nThe biggest joy of this movie is, unsurprisingly, getting to know Bill Paxton&apos;s Dale &quot;The Hurricane&quot; Dixon, the chief of police of a small Arkansas town that three vicious criminals seem to be heading toward like a particularly nasty storm front, leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. Paxton is vibrant and electric here. He&apos;s utterly charming, but he&apos;s much more than he initially seems and Paxton gets to hit those notes of complexity with grace and a natural, easygoing nature. It doesn&apos;t feel like an actor playing a character, it just feels like the filmmakers trained a camera on this guy and told him to be himself. Paxton usually gets to play either a good ol&apos; boy or a dirtbag. This character allows him to play a bit of both, and also to reveal acting muscles that those unfamiliar with his less popular work (see &quot;Frailty&quot;, for God&apos;s sake) may not know he possessed. This is perhaps his greatest performance, although he&apos;s excellent in &quot;Frailty&quot; and &quot;Big Love&quot; as well. It&apos;s a magnificent character, and Paxton brings it fully, forcefully to vivid life. \n\nCynda Williams, Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Beach are likewise excellent here. All of them are magnetic to watch, even though Paxton really does run away with this movie. But the real power of the film is seeing how it unfolds, the unexpected avenues it takes and the little touches and moments that bring it to life and make it feel a bit more like Real Life than most films of this ilk. It feels like a Coen Brothers movie in subject matter and, occasionally, the thrilling ways that Franklin moves the camera. But, I daresay, the Coens would never quite bring the level of verisimilitude to the tale that Franklin and Thornton do. That&apos;s no knock against the Coens, who are among my favorite directors, but &quot;One False Move&quot; is so uncommonly gripping and observant, in a way that the glorious, artful playgrounds of the Coens never quite are. It&apos;s not better, it&apos;s just a different vibe, and one that really makes this movie come alive in an extraordinary way. \n\nI usually don&apos;t watch movies on Crackle because the commercials that are interjected every fifteen minutes or so bug me, but I&apos;m glad I did this time. &quot;One False Move&quot; is, unfortunately, out of print and it&apos;s nowhere to be found on other streaming services. Thank God that Crackle is at least making this forgotten treasure available to be seen. Take my advice, brave the commercials (they don&apos;t edit content, at least) and watch &quot;One False Move&quot;. It really is an amazing film.",

So while I was watching it, I was trying to focus on the fact, whether the documentary is impartial or not. From my point of view, it is more about the people living in the Gaza Stripe, who are unable to live a normal life, however they really desire to. Some of them wish to die, because living in such tough conditions, the constant fear becomes unbearable. I also admire the people who set their lives in danger because of this film. The stories presented in it are incredibly moving. There was just one scene that kind of scared me, when the Palestinians were praying to Allah, asking him to destroy all the Jews. Not the right attitude, I am afraid. As for the Palestinian-Israeli problem itself, the thing I realize the most is not that one of the parties is more right or wrong. Most people just want an end, they are ordinary people like us, with families etc. Judging them would be completely inappropriate.",

And they jump at the chance! \n\nThe movie itself is rather average, but the story is great fun, and more suspensible at times than one might expect. It suffers only from a decidedly 1970s made-for-television feel to the production, though the story is set in 1943. But even this drawback is ameliorated somewhat by closing credits where images of the real-life heroes from World War II are juxtaposed with those of the actors who immortalized their heroism in this film. Well worth watching.",

      "reviewBody": "It would have been nice had this not been World War II and we could actually have done this film in Buenos Aires. As it is, except for a few newsreel shots at the beginning of the film, this might as well have taken place in San Diego. \n\nHaving said that this tinsel of a story is put over by the charm and beauty of its two leads, Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth. Not to mention a good supporting cast led by Adolphe Menjou who is busy poaching on the preserve of Hollywood cranky fathers usually inhabited by folks like Eugene Palette and George Barbier.\n\nMenjou&apos;s got some strange ideas. He wants to see his daughters get married, but in descending order. Rita is number two daughter and she&apos;s holding things up for three and four. Of course numbers three and four have fiancés panting at the bit.\n\nThrough the usual comedy of errors that are prevalent in Fred Astaire movies, Menjou&apos;s conceived a dislike for Fred and Rita&apos;s seeing something in him. How will it all work out?\n\nAstaire movies always have flimsy or silly plot lines, but they have him and an attractive female partner dancing to some of the best music ever written for the screen. And when it&apos;s Jerome Kern&apos;s music, it don&apos;t get much better than that.\n\nAnd the dancing partners don&apos;t get more talented than Rita Hayworth. She is positively radiant in this film. And she and Fred dance divinely to one of my favorite Jerome Kern ballads, I&apos;m Old Fashioned.\n\nReason enough to see this film.",

The movie was punctuated by the sounds of mortars on the perimeter and the occasional flash from an aerial flare. I never forgot it. It rang true there. So true that no-one could say a word after. We just got drunk -- as usual. I haven&apos;t talked to many others who saw this movie. It hit right in the middle of the rising tide of despair over Vietnam. And since it wasn&apos;t actually an anti-war movie, I think it went nowhere. I believe it&apos;s origin is a short novel, possibly autobiographical by J.B. Clavell, author of Tai Pan and other sagas set in the 19th C orient. No matter what George Segal has done since, I have known that he has the heart of a rat. His King was a natural ruler in a perverse state of nature -- and his fate the fate of all maverick rulers in the end. If you can find it and see it, it will take on the character of a lost dream.",

      "reviewBody": "Synopsis:\n\nSri Rama Rajyam is the remake of Legend NTR&apos;s Lava Kusa. It is an interestingly woven subject of Lava Kusa using latest technology of Grading, Digital Intermediate, Sets. The story is basically the later part of Ramayana written by Valmiki Maharshi when Rama sent Sita to forest and later how the twin boys of Rama – Lava and Kusa reach Ayodhya and later Sita joins her Bhoodevi in the end.\n\nPerformances:\n\nBalakrishna at his best, a top class notch reminds his father legendary NTR with his fabulous and award winning action..\n\nNayantara looked serene in the role of Sita in normal clad clothes in the forest.This is her best performance till date. Akkineni Nageswar Rao, the living legend lived up to his stature as Valmiki Maharishi and proved his mettle as an actor. Srikanth as Lakshman is good but can do better. Brahmanandham as Chakali Tippadu does good in the little role. Roja is good as Bhoodevi. The kids who played Lava and Kusa does well too. Rest of the characters all performed to their requirement.\n\nTechnical Departments:\n\nBapu – Ramana, what can we say about this combo. They are proud offspring of Telugu culture and heritage. One would wonder at the dedication and application this duo even in eighties. Even though Ramana is not amidst us today, no body can take the credit from him. He scripted one of the finest movie for the current and forthcoming generations to protect our epics. Take a bow!\n\nBapu is an outstanding example for current generation. He took care in every minute details of the movie right from make up. He drew best performance from each and every artist including the kids. His hard work can be seen in every frame on the screen.\n\nIlayaraja – Music is the important detail for a mythological movie to get people connected to it. Even though the music released few months ago, the songs are still chart busters. And coming to the Back ground music, I wonder what magic did he spell on the screen. The story of Lava Kusa require subtle and soothing back ground score as the movie portrays the emotions of characters in the movie. He did perfect justice and set perfect mood for the movie. Jonnavithula&apos;s lyrics are crystal clear with out difficult language and will enthrall all the audience irrespective of classes\n\nThe production values in the movie are awesome, an enriched quality product – The sets by Magadheera fame Ravinder, Visual effects by Top VFX companies including Kamal Kannan (Magadheera fame).\n\nFinal verdict: Most awaited Mythological Magnum opus &apos;SreeRama Rajyam&apos; finally deserves -It&apos;s a masterpiece from Bapu-Ilayaraja n Balakrishna..Fanatabulous n award winning performance by NBK...Maestro Ilayaraja at his best..Its a visual feast to all movie lovers...Gonna be a feather in TFI&apos;s cap..Enriching qualitative product ..Takes place among one of Great Classics n a must watch movie..",

On their stereotypical shallow &quot;mis&quot;adventure, you have your gun toting towny bandits, your angry bitter meaninglessly antagonizable militia, your sacred burial grounds complete with skulls and dress up skeletons, your creepy random forest dwelling Aussie guy appearing from and disappearing to nowhere warning the characters about said skulls and skeletons, your loin clothed flesh hungry forest locals outfitted with spears, body paint, and bows, and, oh yeah, the best part, your make shift rafts materializing out of nowhere made with no supplies yet seaworthy enough to float them down a river (that looks like a creek in Montana).....Ultimately, the dialog makes no sense and was often difficult to hear (which was a good thing considering the parts you can hear). The &quot;home&quot; video camera stylings fall apart almost immediately and watching becomes a chore. It was understood that this was low low low budget movie, but this was an absolute horror to watch.\n\nDon&apos;t say I didn&apos;t warn you!"

Geographically and historically ,this is a deeply inaccurate movie.Without any paper ,Picard can travel without any problem from the small village near Poitiers to Paris .Made in 1944,it was ,like so many others ,a propaganda movie (&quot;La Marseillaise&quot; can be heard at the end of Walsh&apos;s work.) Forget the background and you have an absorbing movie,the subject of which is still relevant today.Flynn portrays Picard a sentenced-to-death man,who,on his way to the guillotine ,is saved by the gong (He will say later: &quot;the only help I got from the sky was bombs&quot;).But a Javertesque cop (Lukas) is hot on his heels and he arrests him again.\n\nA saboteur blew up a bridge over La Gartempe .The reprisals are terrible:if the &quot;criminal&quot; does not surrender by Tuesday ,one hundred French hostages will be shot.Picard suggests a deal to the cop &quot;I &apos;d rather be shot than put my head in the guillotine ;so let&apos;s make a deal: I &apos;ll tell the Gestapo I&apos;m the saboteur and a hundred lives will be spared.But give me three days just to live...&quot; These three days will be full of unexpected twists,of treason,of nasty tricks (the inhabitants of the village trying to find a scapegoat:&quot;you are inspired by the devil&quot; says the priest;the old lady suggesting an old man he give him up cause he &apos;s got no family) ,of moments of happiness (Picard finds love with the gorgeous Louise -a brunette,Lucile Watson ,who I first mistook for Jennifer Jones-) ,but also of doubt and fear.Interest is sustained till the very last pictures.Flynn gives a mature performance ,far from his dashing usual heroes.Excellent supporting cast.\n\n&quot;Uncertain Glory&quot; might have influenced Henri Jeanson and Christian-Jaque when they made their underrated &quot; Le Repas des Fauves&quot; (1964)."

The movie seethes with subliminal and explicit homo erotic content in a way that I think was a ahead of its time. The black and white photography is very moody and the performances command attention. The influence of Italian neo-realism is very present. It has that distinctive style of some 50s drama, where the scenes develop without much explanation moving the story forward. When the young gangster arrives on the island you know something is going on, without having been given all the usual clues you find in American movies.",

I saw him, for the first time, in a rather extreme and rather stupid drama/comedy &quot;Young doctors in love&quot; (1982) and I was impressed by his acting performance. In &quot;Pretty woman&quot; he is the absolute star. The script supported his role, of course, but the talent is indisputable.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Catherine Corsini doesn&apos;t pull any punch depicting a love triangle of sort in Partir. Suzanne is a typical bourgeois wife of Samuel, a well-connected doctor. Children, big house, steady comfort, Suzanne has everything she could want, except passion. One day, she meets Ivan who make ends-meet working odd jobs and something clicks. \n\nThis very simple, very classic story is made worthwhile for several reasons. The main one being Kristin Scott Thomas delivering yet again a masterful performance. The role is tailor- made for this actress who knows how to subtly let us share the confused state of mind her character is in. Sergi Lopez and Yvan Attal are also good, although their roles are understandably much less challenging. \n\nWhere the screenplay shines is by not spoon-feeding us with justifications or condemnations for the characters. Suzanne&apos;s husband does seem somewhat boring, but he&apos;s not some evil one-dimensional character. And her new romantic interest Yvan is not an adventurous &quot;alpha male&quot;. In fact, although Yvan does represent the freedom Suzanne never had thanks to his bohemian lifestyle, he seems like a somewhat vulnerable man and not terribly versed in &quot;romancing&quot; a woman. She seems more like the one pursuing him to enter this relationship. \n\nSpeaking of relationships, this is also where the movie shines. We&apos;re never entirely sure if what Suzanne is experiencing is true love, or rather if she&apos;s just looking for a way out from her husband and lifestyle. The director doesn&apos;t hold anything back, showing the vulnerability of each of the three character, how selfish they can be, discarding their responsibilities, lying and justifying reprehensible acts against each others. \n\nThis film is fascinating because, in the true tradition of French cinema, it goes for realism. You&apos;ve seen some of these things happen around you, you may have lived through them. Watch this movie with a few people and you&apos;re likely to find people split. Some might sympathize with Suzanne, others with her husband, others with her lover. Yet others might sympathize with all three or none of them. \n\nIn short, Catherine Corsini is not trying to tell you what you should think and lets you make your own impressions throughout the events depicted. There is joy and pain in relationships because relationships, like us, aren&apos;t perfect. This is one such story, showcasing the imperfections. \n\nMy rating would be higher had we been provided with more context. We barely get a glimpse of Suzanne before she meets Yvan. As well, the conclusion did seem sudden and over-the- top to me. Lastly, I feel the husband and children could have used a few more minutes of screen time.",

      "reviewBody": "As a West Virginian, viewing this film is both very inspiring and very, very sad. The inspiring part is how many dedicated activists there were, some from outside the state, who were willing to work long, hard hours to protect the people from the impacts of greed. It was fantastic to see my hometown, Charleston, from above back then and to see the State Capitol looking essentially the same (but sans Lincoln statue).\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, this was a decade before the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (&quot;SMCRA&quot;)and it is about how the milestone 1967 West Virginia Surface Mining Reclamation Act was enacted. The documentary follows a small group of citizens from Raleigh County who went up against the coal lobby and got the strongest law on the books in any U.S. state up to that point. The film demonstrates well how bad situations can inspire individuals to act outside their comfort zone for a cause they strongly believe in.\n\nAs a film, it is short enough to tell the simple story it needs to tell, and does so in a way that generally works well, walking us from getting people to show up to an informational meeting, to speaking at the meeting, and ultimately, to lobbying in Charleston. There was a fascinating discussion on the anti-strip mining activists&apos; drive to Charleston about racial equality (two of the activists were black, while the other handful of activists were white). I thought that the film did not showcase the large scale aspect of strip mining, although maybe strip mining was just starting t be done, so the striking images in the Gates&apos;s In Memory of the Land and People (1977) were not available. This film had a sequence that, I thought, showed how valley fills become mudslides in an artful way.\n\nMy greatest criticism to the filmmaking was that I wish I didn&apos;t have to do research on the internet (something that filmgoers back then would not have been able to do, obviously) to learn that the younger activists were part of Appalachian Volunteers. In the film, Naomi Weintraub alluded to &quot;we&quot; and &quot;other issues,&quot; but some context would have been nice. I gather that they were using tax dollars through the Office of Economic Opportunity to fund the film, so perhaps they didn&apos;t want to attract too much attention.\n\nThere is a certain naiveté to the subjects, but that is only because of the hindsight that we know now. The Act, which gave great powers to regulators over the coal industry, was not strongly enforced and coal companies were able to continue to do the destructive mining that they did before its enaction. From what I can gather, I think the movement would have somewhat of a schism over whether to push for complete abolition of strip mining or for federal regulation. The latter won out, with the SMCRA in 1977. Of course, that too would prove to be inadequate due to a loophole for large-scale mountaintop removal. But that&apos;s a story for a later decade.\n\nIf you are interested in the origins of the fight against mountaintop removal and the evolution of the attitudes of Appalachians, I highly recommend the film.",

I haven&apos;t seen many Harlow films but I&apos;m assuming that her stock character is the one she portrays here , a sort of bad girl with a heart of gold, a lovable moron who speaks first and thinks later. The kind of woman who (if she were your wife/girlfriend) would ruin a party and make a big scene if she became jealous. In other words the kind of woman most men might stupidly have casual sex with and then realizing what an idiot they were saddled with, run away from as fast as they could. I&apos;m guessing many depression era women could identify with her low class stubborn pride but now she seems like an annoying , shrill, infantile idiot constantly seeking approval. As a portrait of this kind of woman , Harlow is magnificent. You might want to strangle her or throw her overboard but she&apos;s always watchable, the bra less gowns help.",

The setting is a military hospital for the ill and injured, and it turns out the place is packed with malingerers and no hopers, hence the arrival of a female doctor with a mind to clean it all up and get everyone healthy again. This is only of interest for the presence of that queen of 1970s exploitation cinema Edwige Fenech, who of course has a couple of nude scenes, including a lengthy dream sequence by one of the other doctors. It&apos;s pretty lame.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is proof that some of the most iridescent, incredible films never make it to mainstream America. Barely anyone I know has even heard of this movie, and it&apos;s quite saddening. Although it has won numerous awards and lots of prestige in Canada, where it was made, I&apos;ve often seen it lying on the shelf untouched at Blockbuster or gay film shops.\n\nThe movie begins with a prisoner named Simone who requests that a specific priest come to hear his confession. The priest, perplexed as to why he has been summoned, arrives at the prison, not knowing what to expect. It is soon divulged that the priest has some confessing of his own to be done when the prisoners trap him in his confessional box and begin to perform a play. This play is about Simone&apos;s childhood, when Simone was attending a Catholic all-boys boarding school and was in a gay relationship with his schoolmate, Valier. They keep their love clandestine until another schoolmate, Bilodeau (the priest as an adolescent), unearths something of what the two lovers have been doing. He confronts them about it, calling them a &quot;disease,&quot; when it is revealed later that he is more insidious than they are.\n\nThings take another dramatic turn when Simone&apos;s father discovers his son has kissed a boy and mutilates his body with a whip. Out of searing rage, Simone succombs to arson. A Parisian woman (who is portrayed by a male actor because the play is being performed by male prisoners) visits the schoool and falls in love with Simone. Despite the distinctely male features on her which expose the actor&apos;s gender, the he does an excellent job of emulating a pristine, romantic woman desperately seeking love.\n\nSimone repudiates Valier, saying &quot;it&apos;s time he started thinking about girls&quot; and that he plans to marry the Parisian woman. Valier is devastated and runs to his mother, who is scorned by the rest of society because she believes herself to be a countess. She is shockingly compassionate and supportive when she learns of Valier&apos;s homosexuality. At the engagement banquet for Simone and his fiancee, Valier sabotages the celebration by dressing like a Greek God and reciting a monologue from the romantic Greek play he and his beloved were rehearsing together in the beginning of the film. And I can&apos;t tell you the rest. It&apos;ll ruin it. All I know is everyone should see this movie-especially gay Catholics. Incredible directing, eloquent dialogue, wonderfully abstract scenary-there&apos;s no way this movie could have been done better!",

I saw her in &quot;Intmacy&quot; and had to find more. It is made by a talented and sometimes engaging filmmaker who explores how women are haunted. It is about a writer whose books don&apos;t grab me, but whose story does. She believed herself haunted.\n\nThe problem is that these three songs from different souls don&apos;t overlap that much.\n\nFrame created written images that were teased out of a struggle with life, one that infused her. Her sanity came from the writing. She didn&apos;t write about insanity and marginalization, she wrote from them to counter and co-opt them somewhat. This engages the reader because most of us are afraid to go as deeply into the darkness as these visions indicate.\n\nThat&apos;s a different thing entirely than the story Campion has chosen to give us, which is about all the external agency that surrounded her. I cannot think of an instance where the literary kite and the cinematic string are in such different dimensions. Sure, its an interesting story that someone&apos;s light survived, I suppose. But we never see that light, or the ledges that were climbed, or the images that were carried out for us.\n\nWhat&apos;s left for Fox to do is emote visually. She does an extraordinary job, quite apart from the fact that it is ineffective in this container. I really do think she&apos;s something  another of those Australian/New Zealand crowd that just seem to have something that is rare elsewhere.\n\nShe and the girls who play her younger selves are redheads. That&apos;s not at all a cinematic device, though it is used cleverly to mend the three actresses. Frame actually had that Clarabelle hair.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

I have been chasing a copy of it for years, and finally located a VHS of it -- it has recently been released on DVD in Germany. If you can get your hands on it, do so. The young Buchholz is an enchanting rogue in this saga of the rise of a charming confidence man, swindling and cheating his way to the top. He sent on to star in films in the US and in Europe, but was seldom as delightful as here, in this early work. His innate good looks and personality are given free reign. One of the most delightful scenes in the epileptic fit he throws for the draft board to avoid military service. Inspired!",

It&apos;s not for kids as it&apos;s rated a hard R. Can&apos;t wait to see what the duo comes up with in an upcoming animated series!!!",

      "reviewBody": "Jon Robin Baitz, the writer of this film, needs to check his facts a little more carefully. The story, as I perceived it, takes place in today&apos;s New York with today&apos;s personalities of the moment.\n\nAt one point of the film when Eli Wurman, played by Al Pacino, is talking to his widowed sister-in-law, Victoria Gray, and he asks her if she remembers when they had marched in Selma? Helloooo Mr. Baitz, how old is Victoria supposed to be? I made her out to be in her early 40s. Now, wouldn&apos;t that have been a miracle? The only way she would have been around Selma at the time of the march on that city would have been in the womb of her mother, if that was so! Well, then again, I could be wrong, she really is in her late 60s!\n\nThis film tries to do too many things; it goes in all directions without making sense, most of the time. The idea of presenting the Eli Wurman of Pacino, who was obviously gay, playing against a straight woman is laughable. Even more ridiculous when the one making the passes is a beautiful woman like Ms. Bassinger, in wild contrast with this washed out person.\n\nMr. Pacino might be a great actor. He has given us many interesting and diverse characters that will be cherished by all his fans, but lately, he has appeared in a series of duds that one wonders who is the person behind his decisions, since many of his choices haven&apos;t added any substance to his body of work.\n\nThis Eli Wurman, being compared to the Burt Lancaster&apos;s character in Sweet Smell of Success by many critics, kept reminding me of the Clifton Webb&apos;s tragic role in The Razor&apos;s Edge. This Eli has seen better days and no one cares about him at all. \n\nThe subplot having to do with the cause Eli is working to promote racial justice to people being deported, sounds empty and not true. It shows a side to this character that deep down inside all he cared for in his life was being at the right places, surrounded by the same celebrities he stooped to serve.\n\nHow about the other aspect of the film about the rich, possible would-be-sponsors of the cause, as libertines and swingers in an opium den on a Wall Street club? Is that supposed to be a metaphor? Oh well, I guess some of us, so out of touch with the powerful people of New York, will never know what we are really missing in those &quot;fun&quot; places.",

      "reviewBody": "Agnès Varda&apos;s &quot;Women Reply: Our Bodies, Our Sex&quot; is a &quot;cine-essay&quot; that attempts to answer the anthropological question &quot;what is a woman?&quot; by showing a wide-variety of unique women in the purest and sometimes most conventional form. For eight minutes, Varda depicts women addressing the audience about how they are more than a role, more than a babymaking unit, and more than meets the eye, most of all. Varda was a filmmaker during the time of the French New Wave, as well as a filmmaker who brought upon the importance of documentary/feminist filmmaking throughout her work in the sixties, seventies, and eighties. &quot;Women Reply&quot; Our Bodies, Our Sex&quot; tries to coherently answer its question by first addressing the fact that women are more than the sum of their breasts, buttocks, and vagina, by showing us them in the purest form. It then shows heavier women, skinnier women, pregnant women, short women, and tall women, providing us with the ideas that all of these women have the potential to make a large difference in modern society as we know it. In 2014, these ideas sound like age-old answers to some of the most redundant questions asked. Looking at this particular short from the perspective of 1975, one sees its true value and artistry thanks to its directness and its willingness to take a stand and answer a very broad, open-ended question, even if the stand and the answer may be worth more than an eight minute short.\n\nNOTE: The film can be viewed on the popular website MUBI, mubi.com/films/women-reply-our-bodies-our-sex\n\nDirected by: Agnès Varda.",

      "name": "A decidedly UNcommon film!",
      "reviewBody": "Granted that this film shows its age and stagebound origins, it nevertheless has a lot to recommend it. Some of its message falls under the rubric of standard-issue moralizing, but it also tells us that the rich and educated have many of the same vices as the poor and uneducated... sometimes even more so. It also offers some unconventional views on topics such as unwed motherhood, social justice, and women&apos;s independence.\n\nThe lovely Constance Bennett is eminently watchable as Ellen Neal, a young woman fighting against the circumstances of her birth, gender, and economic situation to make something decent of her life. While the chic, sophisticated actress is somewhat cast against type, she manages to create a character who is strong, sympathetic, and believable. Bennett makes us willing to overlook (at least most of the time) the long string of clichés and incredible coincidences that pass as a plot. She delivers a couple of breathtaking speeches about morality and &quot;family values&quot; that made me want to stand up and cheer.\n\nThe movie packs an incredible amount of storysome of it quite far-fetchedinto less than 90 minutes. It begins with 18-year-old Ellen being arrested in a raid on a speakeasy, where so far she&apos;s managed to keep her virtue intact (at least that&apos;s what we&apos;re told). A sympathetic judge lets her off with the admonition that she&apos;s heading down a bad road. Heeding the warning, Ellen eventually manages to find less lucrative but more honest work as the maid for a wealthy upper-crust family, the Fullertons. It turns out, however, that the high-society folk are no better than the speakeasy lowlifes; they swill bootleg whiskey, indulge in wild parties, and all of the men seem to be on the make, particularly for Ellen. Among her pursuers is Hugh, the Fullertons&apos; college-age son (played by an appropriately boyish Lew Ayres). Learning of her disreputable past, Hugh believes Ellen will be an easy conquest, but she fights bravely and eloquently for respect. Eventually, though, the two fall in love.\n\nAfter Hugh returns to school, Ellen discovers she is pregnant. Receiving no response to her letters to Hugh, she is forced to quit her job and move back with her mother (played with touching sweetness by Beryl Mercer). Following the birth of her son, Ellen contacts Hugh&apos;s family. Suspecting a shakedown, Papa Fullerton (played by Purnell Pratt) asks family friend Judge Filson (played by Hale Hamilton) to pay off Ellen and avoid a public scandal at all costs. But Ellen is not looking for money; what she wants is for the Fullertons to acknowledge precisely what they wish to keep secret: her relationship with Hugh and his paternity of her child. She hires a lawyer, the seedy but honest Yates (played to eccentric perfection by Tully Marshall) to press her claim.\n\nEarlier in the film, we learn that as a young man, Judge Filson himself once fathered a child out of wedlock, but that his lower-class lover made no claim on him for fear that she would ruin his social prospects. He does not know what became of his sweetheart and the child he has never seen.\n\nWhen Judge Filson meets with Ellen, he discovers she&apos;s not the conniving gold-digger he&apos;d expected. As a matter of fact, he&apos;s quite taken with her and believes her when she insists that Hugh Fullerton fathered her child. Filson encourages Hugh not to repeat his own mistake and to claim both Ellen and the baby. But Hugh&apos;s father, as well as his friend Bud, continue to regard Ellen as low-class trash and refuse to allow Hugh to reconcile with Ellen.\n\nEllen has no choice but to have her lawyer Yates drag the whole issue into court. The trial scene is not to be believed (or missed). Besides some amazing revelations that follow pell-mell one after another, the scene is a hoot from a legal-procedural point of view. I&apos;ll not reveal the outcome, but suffice it to say the many, many loose ends do get tied up in tidy fashion.\n\nIt&apos;s sad that a movie that&apos;s so entertaining, so fascinating from a socio-historical perspective, and directed by the great Victor Fleming should be unavailable on video and so rarely shown anywhere. If you have a chance to catch it, don&apos;t miss the opportunity.",

It would have swept the awards if not for another film called &apos;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&apos;.\n\nAjay Devgan plays Shekhar a small time crook who&apos;s only helping Sanjana (Kajol) at first because he&apos;s trying to steal back an item she accidently picked up from him.  In the end he tries to help her win back her crooked fiance who is having an affair with someone else.  Wouldn&apos;t you know it, the kids fall in love.  Great visuals, songs and comedy make it a treat though.\n\nCharacter development is somewhat weak - Shekhar stealing because he needs the money for a family member&apos;s operation.  Om Puri does an excellent job providing comic relief at times as a cashew chewing cop hot on Shekhar&apos;s trail.\n\nMentionable Scenes: Hostage Situation in the mall and the climax.",

I went into this movie know a it was based on a short story, but I had not read it nor heard anything about it.\n\nThe acting was very good Overall from a semi-star cast. Bradley Cooper did a great job, as did Leslie Bibb. Vinnie Jones did a good job by pulling off the Sphynx-like roll from Gone in 60 Seconds. He was a calm, quiet collected man who just looks like a natural born killer. I was wondering why Brooke Shields name did not come up or was used to sell this movie, but found out she is just a minor roll in the movie. Peter Jacobson (one of the new members of Dr. House) has a small roll in the movie as a bit of comic relief.\n\nThe plot line, I am saying this without reading the book, was decent, but there were times I feel the viewer had to make jumps with what was going on. I won&apos;t give away anything in the movie, but it just seemed like there were times that a whole scene took place that was a bit unnecessary, though they may have been thrown in as red herons. The movie is rather straight forward and basic, but it is still able to keep you pulled in. I was kept excited throughout the whole movie until the end and the plot twist occurs.\n\nThe violence/blood did not seem over the top for what was occurring. Never was there a part that someone spurted massive amount of blood out of a paper cut. The violence was a bit disturbing, and there were a couple dismemberment/decapitation scenes.\n\nAfter watching this movie, I felt that this could become another gore cult classic with such as Dead or Alive. Also, if this was well publicized and launched in more theaters, I think it would have easily outsold The Happening and The Strangers, the biggest horror flicks of the summer.",

      "name": "An episode of Italy&apos;s unification",
      "reviewBody": "The scenario is the city of Rome and the title translates to It Was the Lord&apos;s Year 1870. Italy&apos;s unification under King Vittorio Emanuele of the House of Savoy was on its way to completion but several obstacles remained. One was the incorporation of the Papal States, at the time a temporal kingdom including Rome and comprising much of Central Italy. The integrity of the Papal States was guaranteed by France, and Rome was under military rule. Garibaldi&apos;s forces tried to take Rome in 1867 in coordination with an uprising in the city but the attempt failed.\n\nIn July 1870 the Franco-Prussian War began and Emperor Napoleon III withdrew most of the French forces from Rome. King Vittorio Emanuele tried to negotiate the entry of the Italian army into Rome but was rebuffed by Pope Pius IX. Local patriots organized an insurrection, this time supported by advancing Italian troops and the annexation of the Papal states was de facto achieved. It became de jure after a plebiscite in October.\n\nThe main characters are Augusto Parenti, a local activist (Marcello Mastroianni), his partner Anna (Anna Magnani) and their son Mario. As the movie begins Augusto languishes in jail refusing to apply for a papal pardon while Anna lives in precarious conditions trying to provide for Mario and insure his education. Anna Magnani&apos;s range as an actress was not unlimited but when given a congenial role she could play it like nobody else. The charismatic Mastroianni does an excellent job too although he is assigned some overdramatic lines near the end.\n\nI liked this unpretentious movie. At times it has the look and feel of a history lesson but this adds to its charm. Recreation of time and place by set designer Osvaldo Desideri is flawless, enhanced by the cinematography of Leonida Barboni. Part the filming was done in historic buildings such as Castel Sant&apos;Angelo, used by the Papal States as a prison. Director Alfredo Gianetti moves the action fluidly and music is provided by the illustrious Ennio Morricone.\n\nSadly this is Magnani&apos;s last feature film (she appeared briefly and for the last time in Fellini&apos;s Roma in 1972). She made an enduring mark in world cinema.",

      "reviewBody": "When I sat down to watch this 2016 movie titled &quot;Sheborg Massacre&quot;, I must admit that I wasn&apos;t really harboring a shred of high hopes for the movie. Why? Well, the movie&apos;s title and cover just wasn&apos;t exactly screaming top notch movie. But with it being a movie that I hadn&apos;t already seen, much less actually heard about, of course I opted to give writer and director Daniel Armstrong the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe storyline in the movie was pretty straightforward, for better or worse. While the storyline wasn&apos;t neither rocket science or Shakespearian theater, then writer Daniel Armstrong did manage to put together something that was cheesy enough to actually be entertaining.\n\nOf course I wasn&apos;t familiar with a single actress or actor on the cast list. The acting performances in the movie were actually fair.\n\nThe fight scenes in the movie were hilarious to watch, especially since in many of the scenes you can see the punches thrown are not even remotely close to making contact with whomever was being punched. That got a good chuckle out of me.\n\nThis is a low budget movie, no doubt about it. But I will say that writer and director Daniel Armstrong actually managed to turn it into something oddly enjoyable. There is just something fundamentally cheesy about the entire movie that actually works in favor of the overall impression of the movie.\n\nThe special effects in the movie were exactly that - special. I loved the stuffed toy dogs that were supposed to be dead dogs, and the spaghetti in tomato sauce that was supposed to be their innards. Very low key effects and they got a good chuckle out of me. Points for trying, at least. Something that speaks well in favor of the movie is the sheer amount of blood and mayhem that there is throughout the course of the 87 minutes that the movie ran for.\n\nIt looked and felt like the people involved in making &quot;Sheborg Massacre&quot; had a blast making the movie.\n\nWhile &quot;Sheborg Massacre&quot; doesn&apos;t have the contents to become a cult classic, it definitely is well-worth checking out if you enjoy low budget cheesy sci-fi action movies.\n\nMy rating of &quot;Sheborg Massacre&quot; lands on a five out of ten stars.",

What they find is something very strange and different...\n\nAustralia has produced some high quality horror in recent times, this sadly - in spite of some sterling efforts - isn&apos;t one of them. \n\nJustin Dix&apos;s (director/co-producer/co-writer) film is guilty of lifting from a whole bunch of other sci-fi/horror films to the point where the smart ideas in the narrative are practically squashed. Everything from Aliens and Scanners to Event Horizon are greased in to maintain a viable interest factor, a shame because the low budget is never an issue as the debut director shows a keen eye for atmosphere setting.\n\nThe facility that the characters find themselves in, as they fight for survival, is splendidly awash with a futuristic metallic sheen. While claustrophobia, as the title suggests, is one of the key character&apos;s of the piece. Acting is fine, no ham or cheese here, and in spite of the leanings from elsewhere, pic is never dull. It&apos;s not one for genre fans to base their evening in by the fire with, but it&apos;s just above average and shows Dix to have some potential behind the camera. 6/10",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Going the Distance&quot; is just a romantic comedy, but an adequate one. Justin Long and Drew Barrymore have real chemistry, making it seem fairly romantic, and Long and his friends are actually very funny men, making the film come across as more funny and less not-funny.\n\nI generally really like films picking simple stories and just telling them straight. For the most part, this film did that. But here the problem is when they bothered to include sub-plots, they were meaningless and then dropped. This unfortunately just highlights the poor writing. Then trying to cover up the poor writing, they added lots of profanity and many off-topic jokes. There is no problem with profanity, it&apos;s just that there wasn&apos;t much need for it here.\n\nNow let&apos;s talk about jokes - which both make and break this film. It is laugh-out-loud funny in places, and now, I am even more of a believer that Justin Long, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day are very much underrated, great comedic actors. Their timing was flawless and they were even able to make lame jokes seem funny. So, yes, I laughed, but the problem is the majority of the jokes were thrown in for the sole purpose of a laugh, and they had little to do with the storyline of the film. They were laugh-out-loud vulgar, not laugh-out-loud smart.\n\n&quot;Going the Distance&quot; is a romantic comedy for those that like romantic comedies. It is written better than some, and at least you are laughing enough so you don&apos;t notice how poor it is.",

      "reviewBody": "Charlie Muffin is an exceptional cold-war spy story.  Our title hero is not very glamorous by James Bond standards: no spying gadgets, no Pussy Galores, no megalomaniac enemies with crocodile farms.  It&apos;s simply the old West vs. East story during the cold war.  Charlie is an exceptional spy with exceptional methods and exceptional results, but that is not much appreciated by his peers who want rules and not exceptions.\n\nAlthough this spy story is set in the real world and not in comic book land, we have the odd chase, explosion and deception here and there, and although they are perhaps slightly less spectacular than in the world of Derek Flint their impact is larger, because they happen in a context we can relate to. Not only that, but the story keeps us also guessing.  In our traditional spy film we know who&apos;s going to win (the good guys, of course) and how our hero will cope at the end (with a bottle of champagne under one arm and a glamour puss under the other). But this world is not that black and white and right up to the end one could imagine many outcomes, and the actual ending makes a fitting climax to a great film.\n\nDavid Hemmings plays the title character understated: intelligent but inconspicuous, moderate but stylish.  Generally the cast is excellent; I especially loved Pinkas Braun as the defected Kalenin.",

      "reviewBody": "Seen on a complete whim, &quot;Journey Into Self&quot; didn&apos;t necessarily took me to different states of mind, neither different or alternative trains of thought when it comes to seeing a therapy group as they expose their frailty state of mind and get to know each other, building a sense of belonging and working on their problems. Anxiety, depression or any other of mental problem aren&apos;t mentioned or specifically dealt by the two doctors featured here (Dr. Carl Rogers and Dr. Richard Farson), but whatever is bugging those men and women is shared, as they face difficulties in dealing with spouses, friends or just another person. Was I changed after the movie? Not quite, but it was interesting following the experiment despite the downer mood it left on me for a little while.\n\nIn short, it felt like going &quot;We, people, are all the same yet so different in our uniqueness, so what&apos;s the point of worrying or getting deeply anxious when it comes to social relations?&quot;. Because we humans are not so predictable as we want them to be, and there&apos;s a wide variety unseen and unexplored in this little time given we call life and it&apos;s too hard to figure out what people want from each other, and why the need each other, or why there&apos;s hate, prejudice and contempt for what we see in others without getting to know people.\n\nDrs. Rogers and Farson united a very diverse group of people for 16 hours, but the film covers less than an hour of the meeting and some of the folks credited and appearing weren&apos;t even given a time to share their troubles on film. They talk about social difficulties they have while dealing with other people, the impressions they have from one another, and the desire for change their lives as they feel there&apos;s something missing. Not much time for humor, but when tears roll down as they slowly become used to one another and see how similar they are or how a connection is formed when they get to know each other, is when we&apos;re fully invested in the human emotions as something difficult to express but very valid and helpful to develop personal connections.\n\nGladly, it was easy to feel empathy for the men and women featured here, or at least I&apos;d like to think that most audiences will relate with the burden shared by then as they want and need change in their lives, either with the relationship they&apos;re having and feel unwanted; or in the case of Jerry to stop worrying about the fact he doesn&apos;t have friends, neither feels a need for them but deep down he knows that&apos;s not a right feeling, or the young Eurasian woman who doesn&apos;t want to be seen as a delicate lotus flower. It&apos;s very uneasy to go by saying &apos;we&apos;re all awkward&apos; when we&apos;re bombarbed by media and our daily lives in seeing an everlasting propaganda of happiness and &quot;normalcy&quot; that simply isn&apos;t there, and to realize that our &quot;masks&quot; sometimes aren&apos;t all that good to be used while dealing with whoever we need to deal.\n\nI was depressed watching this journey as I haven&apos;t seen solutions that were good or wildly effective to be applied, and with the little we&apos;re given about the folks, without an expanded background or an evolution in their treatment, it all seems to boil down to the need of communicating with another person - listening too. Of course, some fine results and a little change will happen within that group is they&apos;re allowed to find a time to get to know each other. The reality outside is a bigger conflict, and the doctors don&apos;t offer the tools and approaches for what they can do while dealing with others, or how communication should be developed when dealing with a partner. Perhaps all of those things were there, but the makers didn&apos;t want to make a 16-hour documentary just like the group meeting was done originally. And perhaps that&apos;s exactly the film we needed, and I wouldn&apos;t mind seeing an epic about that issue.\n\nWhatever gets you through the night, this documentary might help you out with some insight - if you&apos;re not highly demanding as I am. It&apos;s good but there&apos;s many lacks that weren&apos;t filled as I hoped, and one particular early reply by Dr. Rogers on the women who prefer dealing with cats than with her husband, there&apos;s one word he used that almost made me turn it off (a rude remark even done on a polite manner is still rude). 8/10.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the truly great films of 2010, &quot;A Prophet&quot; is an unforgettable account of a young man&apos;s experiences in a French prison.\n\nMalik El Djebena is only 19 when he&apos;s sentenced to six years in prison for a crime he claims he didn&apos;t commit. Though an Arab, Malik becomes the cat&apos;s-paw for an aging Corsican mob boss named Cesar Luciani whose influence in the prison has begun to wane as more and more Muslims are brought in to swell the prisoner ranks. Eventually, the ever-resourceful Malik finds a way to straddle the lines separating the various factions in the prison, while at the same time partnering with his buddy to run a hashish operation when he&apos;s out on his frequent 24-hour leaves.\n\nThe beauty of &quot;A Prophet&quot; is that we really get the sense that, had he been dealt a halfway decent hand in life, Malik might have actually been a kind, caring person, instead of the lost soul that he&apos;s become. But the lack of any parental influence in his life, his illiteracy, and now his consignment to prison life have left him with few viable options other than to become involved in mayhem and crime. He&apos;s horrified by the fact that, as a kind of loyalty test early on, Luciani forces him to murder in cold blood a man he doesn&apos;t know and might even like under other circumstances. And there are heartbreaking moments throughout where we sense the goodness in Malik&apos;s tortured soul. His appreciation of simple kindnesses, his attempts at learning to read, his childlike wonder as he looks out of a plane window for the first time, his tenderness with a buddy&apos;s newborn son - all go a long way towards mitigating some of the truly despicable acts of violence and murder he&apos;s called upon to do. The brilliant screenplay wisely refuses to judge Malik; it simply presents the options and parameters that have been given to him by fate, society, nature, what have you - and watches as he maneuvers through, in and around them in order to survive.\n\nHarsh and brutal as this film can be at times - for it never shies away from portraying what life is like in a prison setting - it is in those more lyrical moments, the ones in which we are allowed to see into the heart of this young man, that &quot;A Prophet&quot; achieves true masterpiece status.\n\nTahar Rahim rises to the challenge in a brilliantly understated, award-worthy performance as Malik, capturing our sympathy and concern throughout. Niels Arestrup is also outstanding as the brutal and demanding Luciani, as is Adel Bencherif as Malik&apos;s one friend from prison who serves as both a positive and a negative influence on the young man.\n\nDirected with unerring conviction and power by Jacques Audiard, &quot;A Prophet&quot; is a cinematic work of art - and a movie not to be missed.",

      "reviewBody": "Not really, but someone took offense to how I titled this review and had it deleted. Seriously. Someone was offended but what I wrote and not with Korine&apos;s contribution to this film? Amazing. So, with the above edit, here&apos;s the original review: \n\n&quot;It is a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.&quot; This quotation from Shakespeare&apos;s MacBeth (about life) could also serve as a capsule review of Harmony Korine&apos;s contribution to the new anthology film &quot;The Fourth Dimension,&quot; which had its premiere at the San Francisco International Film Festival.\n\nExecutive Producer Eddy Moretti, wrote a &quot;creative brief&quot; with over 50 specific instructions to be followed in the production of an original film. Actual instructions included &quot;There needs to be someone wearing tap shoes,&quot; &quot;Stray dogs are good. They can be really meaningful&quot; and &quot;The director must direct one scene from the film with a blindfold on over his or her eyes.&quot; He found three directors willing to work within these and the other restraints - the USA&apos;s Harmony Korine, Russia&apos;s Alexey Fedorchenko, and Poland&apos;s Jan Kwiecinski. Each produced a 30 minute film and the results have been combined to create &quot;The Fourth Dimension.&quot; It is 2/3 of a good film.\n\nKorine&apos;s film, &quot;The Lotus Community Workshop,&quot; stars Val Kilmer as a motivational speaker named (coincidentally) Val Kilmer. The film is set in a typical American bowling alley where a cross-section of citizens gathers to be inspired by Mr. Kilmer&apos;s exhortations - about nothing. Kilmer delivers a series of nonsequitors that occasionally individually amuse, but on the whole deliver zilch. While this may be Korine&apos;s point - that people in the motivational speaking business say anything they can and mean nothing they say - it is a point belabored through the entire short film that made it feel much longer than it actually was. It is also a point that has been made by plenty of filmmakers before him. Kilmer&apos;s participation in this project isn&apos;t really surprising when one looks at this actor&apos;s eclectic career path, but one has to wonder if without his involvement whether anyone would be paying any attention to this film at all.\n\nFedorchenko&apos;s film, &quot;Chrono Eye,&quot; is a very interesting take on time travel. Igor Sergeev portrays Grigory Mikhailovich, the inventor of a device that allows brief glimpses into the past (and, eventually, the future) but from the perspective of an individual who seems uninterested in the event Mikhailovich&apos;s seeks to view. While continuing to work on his invention, he is being hounded by a tax collector seeking to collect on the money he had been awarded for his invention, and by the incessant dancing of an upstairs neighbor. While Mikhailovich fiddles with the past and future, the possibilities of the present are slipping right by him.\n\nWhile no doubt hampered by a low budget, this film succeeds in getting us to accept its premise (one antenna underground, one antenna in the air, and voila! Time travel) and feel the frustrations of the main character.\n\nHow did Fedorchenko manage to take a story like this and get it to meet so many requirements of the brief? Easy. He just took a script he already had and stuck in the things the brief requested. An economical approach, but probably one of the main reasons this film succeeds.\n\nThe last of the trilogy of films, Kweiecinski&apos;s &quot;Fawns,&quot; follows a small group of Eastern European &apos;hipsters&apos; as they traipse through an eerily abandoned village. We eventually learn that they are in the path of an approaching natural disaster and seem not to care for their fates. One person then exits, another one enters and attitudes take a drastic change.\n\nThis film does a great job of setting a mood of impending doom, and has a lot to say about how, when push comes to shove, humanity can touch even the most jaded soul.\n\nAll three directors appeared at a Q&amp;A following the film, and it was interesting to see how the films tended to match the directors&apos; personalities. Kwiecinski was the most verbose and seemed to have a generally upbeat view of things. Federchenko was very precise and methodical in his answers (delivered via translator) and gave the lengthiest responses to the audience&apos;s questions. Korine acted like an idiot and gave responses that really didn&apos;t answer any questions.\n\nThe premiere showing was the first time that each director had a chance to view the others&apos; films. I asked them for a response to each others films within the context of being screened with their works. Kweicinski said he probably needed to think about Korine&apos;s film before commenting (Was he just being polite? I choose to think so) Fedorchenko gave a lengthy response about artists working within the restrictions of the brief. Korine&apos;s response? Quote – &quot;Uhh. Yeah. Yeah. Good sh** all around.&quot; Brilliant analysis, Harmony...\n\nwww.worstshowontheweb.com",

      "reviewBody": "This piece is the first and only movie directed by Dezsõ Garas. He is a well known and respected actor in Hungary, which makes this movie a worth-to-watch picture. It was made at the very end of the communist era - it was unimaginable to make such movie before these times because of political censorship.\n\nThe basic idea is based on the obvious contradicts of the communist system, in my opinion the plot was a bit boring but full of excellent ideas, and a lot of fun - you can taste the original hungarian harsh sarcasm.\n\nThe directing is mediocre (though you should expect a lot of experimentaland well set sequence), but the acting is wonderful, especially the main role, József played by Károly Eperjes, and Judit Pogány as her mother. However, my favorite in this movie is is Ferenc Kállai, the political leader of the litt le village where the movie takes place, Rátót, where every man is called &quot;Béla&quot;, except the main character, the lad mother. If you have never lived under communism, you might miss the point of this picture, but it can still be enjoyable for you, beside the hungarian masterpiece of this genre, A Tanú (The Witness), made by Péter Bacsó. 8/10",

Not a movie for a dull housewife, because it holds your breath until 88 minute and then bang. You must see. Its something similar to &quot;Unknown&quot;, but less mysterious and more unpredictable. Thats one of those movies, then you expect nothing, and get everything. In some point of a movie i even thought that i see the same young don from the godfather, running and entertaining us as always. So, sit back, relax, and then join Pacino in solving his own murder.

      "reviewBody": "Lucio Fulci is best known for his gory horror films of the seventies and eighties, but like most Italian directors of that era, he went where the money was, tackling whatever genre was currently in vogue. Dracula in the Provinces is a very silly sex comedy with just a smidge of horror, Lando Buzzanca starring as wealthy toothpaste factory owner Costante Nicosia, whose boorish behaviour sees him cursed by an elderly aunt. When Costante travels to Romania on business, he finds himself invited to the castle of Count Dragulescu (John Steiner) where he spends a night of drunken debauchery. The next morning he wakes up in bed with with the count and consequently believes that he is turning into a homosexual; however, on finding bite marks on his neck, he becomes worried that he is becoming a vampire.\n\nAccording to IMDb&apos;s trivia, Lucio Fulci said Dracula in the Provinces was among his favourite films he directed. Of the thirty-two Fulci films I&apos;ve seen, this is my LEAST favourite - I don&apos;t know whether much of the humour was lost in translation, but I found the film about as funny as a case of botulism. Buzzanca mugs his way through a series of desperately unfunny scenes, including Costante explaining his fears about turning gay to his doctor (Rossano Brazzi), visiting a con-artist wizard (Ciccio Ingrassia) to have the &apos;evil eye&apos; curse removed, and going to a dominatrix (Moira Orfei). I spent the entire film clock-watching, longing for the whole thing to finish, but like watching a kettle waiting for it to boil, this just prolonged the agony. As bad as some of Fulci&apos;s horrors are (Manhattan Baby, Sodoma&apos;s Ghost, The Sweet House of Horrors), none of them are as utterly atrocious as this miserable movie. 1/10.",

Soon they are sort of owning the island and having various encounters with some young men they have met. All three, plus a beautiful concert pianist, are hard to take your eyes off of. But at some point it slogs along to where there are no real questions. I watched it because the Criterion Collection included it and I have been picking an choosing from their library of films.

As everything else in this film, her acting is unique - it is completely her own - neither &quot;British&quot; nor &quot;American&quot; nor anything else I have ever seen. There is something mesmerizing about it.\n\nThe lengthy, unbroken, natural shots are wonderful, reminding us that we have become too accustomed to a few restricted ways of shooting and editing.",

      "reviewBody": "Alexandr &quot;Sascha&quot; Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an Italy-hosted tournament. His brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James) to scope out possible marriage partners. Vera leans toward a handsome count but, astonishingly, Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha, whom she met on a walk. Sascha, too, is taken with Natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting. But, with the concentration that Sascha must give to the chess matches and, with other happenings in his past still causing problems, will he win the heart of Natalia? Oh, and can he become the chess champion, also? This is a lovely film, based on a novel by Nabokov. The acting is amazing, with Watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and Turturro utter perfection as the shy, awkward chess enthusiast. James gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well. As for the look of the film, it could not be better. The scenery is of the put-your-eye-out variety, the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause. Yes, the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks, at times, making it a film not everyone will appreciate. Then, too, the ending is bittersweet. However, if you love romance, period pieces, great acting, knockout scenery, or the fine art of motion picture creation, don&apos;t miss this one. You will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms.",

But this movie makes some very good snapshots of the time then. &quot;Solino&quot; is about a Italian immigrant who arrives in the &quot;Ruhr&quot; region of Germany during the 60s.  The immigrant and his family then start the first Pizza restaurant in the region. The characters are excellent drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling he does. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, isnt that good. Well, you just dont believe him the role. But the character is wellbalanced and fits perfectly into this script. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the style of &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Many people will probably hate this movie, say its boring. Not much tension? - yes, but an outrageous movie.  9 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "The picture deals with a mentally handicapped young man (Cuba Gooding) . He&apos;s taken under the wing a expert trainer (Ed Harris and married to forgotten Debra Winger) of a high school and takes deeply interest with him . He&apos;s nicknamed ¨Radio¨ because he likes listening the radio so much . In the beginning he suffers numerous jokes and misfortunes in charge of the team members but his goodness and kindness become him into a great inspiration for his community .\n\nIt&apos;s a brilliant and moving story , although being sometimes slow moving but relies heavily on the continued relation among them , but it doesn&apos;t make tiring . However , being amusing and entertaining , though overly sentimental . In the picture is developed some ethics and moral issues such as friendship , helpless youthful , familiar assistance.. ..narrated in nice sense of ductility and sensibility . Because the relationship between Radio and the town is ongoing , even up until the present day , the screenwriter choose to compress the highlights of the relationship to a one-year period . Cuba Gooding is terrific , he plays perfectly the severally mentally retarded young man , making a perceptible and enjoyable interpretation . In addition , Ed Harris acting as the good coach is top-notch . Sensational and awesome musical score by the great James Horner (Windtalkers , A beautiful mind) . Excellent cinematography by Don Burgess (Spiderman , Terminator 3) , he&apos;s Robert Zemeckis&apos;s usual cameraman . This film based on real deeds was well directed by Michael Tollin . Rating : Better than average . It&apos;s a winner for Cuba Gooding and Ed Harris fans .",

      "reviewBody": "After a spurt of short silent movies in the early 1920s, three dimensional films lay dormant until two tinkerers in the technology piqued the interest of MGM executives in the mid-1930s. The pair produced three shorts, their first, December 1935 &quot;Audioscopiks,&quot; which was nominated for Best Short Subject in the Novelty category at the the 8th Academy Awards. Directed by Jacob Leventhal and John Noring, the film was cinema&apos;s first 3-D movie to be produced by a major Hollywood studio.\n\nThe pair borrowed late 1800s technology using the red-cyan process called &apos;anaglyph&apos; that split the image into two as well as displayed two colors to be viewed through special glasses. Today&apos;s process hasn&apos;t diverged much from &quot;Audioscopiks&apos;&quot; split format. The 3-D camera they used contained two lenses, just as a human with two eyes is able to see three dimensional objects and landscapes.\n\n&quot;Audioscopiks&quot; unfolds an overview of the 3-D process as it existed in the mid-1930s. The objects shown on the screen move towards the audience to give its viewers a thrill up the leg as well as a frightening experience. The narration of the short by Pete Smith offers a certain pizzazz and a strong dose of entertainment that both informs and stimulates the viewer. Smith had been employed by MGM since 1925 as a director of publicity. His voice and witty scripts were perfect for the short films MGM was churning out, including sports newsreels. His narrations were so funny that the studio gave him his own seres called &apos;Pete Smith Specialties.&apos; He produced over 150 of the near-ten minute shorts from the 1930s until 1955 that sprinkled humor with little known yet fascinating subjects.\n\nLeventhal and Noring made two additional 3-D shorts for MGM, 1938&apos;s &apos;The New Audioscopiks&apos; and 1941&apos;s &apos;Third Dimensional Murder.&apos; All three were processed by Technicolor. Viewers, with the special glasses, were fully able to appreciate the full spectrum of the three dimensions.",

      "reviewBody": "Alright then, we&apos;ve got Craig Sheffer playing the creator of a mobile drilling machine that causes a major worldwide countdown to disaster.  Of course, he walked off the job a year or so earlier fearing that his creation might be used as a weapon.  He was right.  It&apos;s the potential for that disaster thing I just mentioned which brings our would-be hero back to save the day.  If this sounds remotely like so many other films out there, it probably is.\n\nThis is B movie territory, folks, but it&apos;s a FUN ride!  Sheffer gets to dig down 120 miles into the Earth and place 5 nuclear bombs that will create a chain effect that stops the planet from tearing itself apart...while also saving valuable budget money by not showing too many disasters on the surface (always visible because the camera shakes before we get some cheesy CGI effects).\n\nAlong for the ride is James Russo, Wil Wheaton (giving a better performance than in &quot;Python&quot;) and Terry Farrell (Dax from &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space 9&quot;). What the film isn&apos;t able to entertain you with visually because of what I&apos;m assuming is a modest budget, it more than makes up for in dialogue and acting.  There are a few techno-babble bits here and there, but these guys (and gal) are enjoying themselves and provide some welcome laughter.  Forget the other Government stiffs.  They kind of pad the film a bit and aren&apos;t nearly as fun to watch.\n\nIt&apos;s especially nice to see Sheffer in a more heroic role after &quot;Hellraiser: Inferno&quot; and Wheaton still has a smile that will make you melt.  If you can overlook some really fake CGI effects and just take the movie for what it&apos;s supposed to be, entertainment, then you could do a lot worse than give &quot;Deep Core&quot; a try."

You may think you know where this is going from the first view of the corpse in the trunk, but you&apos;d probably be wrong. There&apos;s a touching side trip to Charleston, where Jimmy (Burke) faces down some old demons, even if the film never knows quite what to do with the Jake Busey character after this, and Neve Campbell is properly enigmatic as &quot;the girl&quot;--she&apos;s femme enough without being overly fatale. My favorite scene is when Dil, er, Billy, er, Jimmy sings along with a tape of Fred Neil on &quot;Other Side of This Life.&quot; If you&apos;ve never seen &quot;Dil Scallion,&quot; it&apos;s a much better film than &quot;Lost Junction,&quot; but this one is okay, an agreeable time-waster, if a bit more beige than noir. But that&apos;s fine too.",

      "reviewBody": "Should you watch this film? I believe the following questions may be a decent guide to making this decision. Are you a Zappa fan who likes many of his different musical phases? If so, then this is a must. Are you a casual Zappa fan, partial to newer stuff only? If so, then approach with caution. Do you like very bizarre sequences put together seemingly at random? If so, this is a must. If you hate that kind of thing, then you will probably hate this. When in doubt, have a backup ready so you can switch to that if you lose patience. Oh, and guys out there, I wouldn&apos;t recommend showing this to your girlfriend unless she is a big Zappa fan. By all means, I do NOT recommend planning a romantic evening with a girl with standard pop culture tastes that is bookended by playing her samples of your Magma and King Crimson collection and then ending with a screening of 200 Motels, not even as an experiment. Trust me, I have tried this (once) and the results were not good. But I digress...\n\nWhat do you get from 200 motels? Random weirdness and silliness with a very 1965-1970 feel to it, kind of like a strangely lighthearted feverish dream. You also get some very interesting music of highly variable quality and some great in-jokes that you will find hilarious if you have followed Zappa&apos;s career. I will never again be able to drive past a town named &quot;Centerville&quot; (there are lots of these in the midwest USA) without having that Flo and Eddie zombie-like sequence flash through my head. I would certainly not consider this a good film or anywhere close to a good film. But it is certainly oddly interesting.",

Superb sound editing, great comic set pieces (the how to smoke a joint scene or the black salute), poignant (finding the smokes in the Jeannie&apos;s room with &quot;Even the white horses&quot; playing), the music performances (Ode to a Screw) and such acute observation of American Society. Nothing is missed: the comic potential of the fact that there is a &quot;Society for the Parents of Lost Children(SPLC)&quot;, the realization that it is the parents who are lost; the lucrative potential of the counter culture and the &quot;establishment&apos;s&quot; realization of this (best seen in the hilarious speech by Jeanies boyfriend toward the end). Much of the comedy is drawn from the characters&apos; little crises in their lives and their attempts to solve them, but it is always a warm and affectionate comedy. Forman likes these people, he likes America, he&apos;s willing them on, every slightly misguided step of the way.",

      "reviewBody": "This little-known drama by director Roland Klick introduces a prototype working-class family in a drab German suburb during the post-Wirtschaftswunder dip. The relationships between neighbor families, between local schoolboys, between middle-aged father and teen daughter, between man and neighbor&apos;s wife - the relations that define social morals of a community - may seem exaggerated in some parts of the screenplay, but definitely a necessity in this particular story. The characters are well-written, especially the young protagonist&apos;s father, the neighbor&apos;s daughter and her drunk father. Klick&apos;s direction is minimal, utilitarian with a conscious avoidance of cinematic flair both in terms of visuals and soundtrack. And that enables the film&apos;s bleak, nihilistic, somewhat disturbing plotline flourish like a naturally-growing cactus in a desert. As the story unfolded, I was often reminded of Michael Haneke&apos;s &apos;Benny&apos;s Video&apos; and indeed there are some similarities in the thematic content like juvenile jealousy and how far parents go to protect their children. Although this film happens in a more &apos;generic&apos; setting, and lacks the social complexity of the Haneke title, a predictable yet very well-written ending definitely makes it memorable.",

      "reviewBody": "Five years ago, Tania (Mariya Morinova) left her small village and left to Moscow, pursuing a career as a model. Now she returns, and for everyone&apos;s surprise, she decides to marry Mishka (Marat Mashanov), her former lover. As the preparations for the wedding begin, many passions are set loose. Mishka&apos;s family does not trust Tania and Mishka himself doubts about Tania&apos;s motivations. To make things worse, Mishka is not wealthy, so he must rely on his best friend Garkusha&apos;s talent for the illegal in order to raise money. The Wedding night will be full of surprises.\n\nThat is the plot of &quot;Svadba&quot;, a Russian movie that proves that good movies are made with love and not with SFX. The wedding celebration is a perfect background for this comedy/drama that explores the misfortunes of a typical Russian family of miners. The realistic approach taken by director Pavel Lungin makes the audience feel part of the celebration, as if it were the real video home of an authentic wedding.\n\nPart of this success is due to the great acting of the cast, Andrei Panin is outstanding as Garkusha and he steals every scene he is in. His character the perfect catalyst between drama and comedy, giving the film humor and heart. Mariya Morinova is beautiful and shows a great talent for drama as the mysterious Tania. The rest of the cast is quite good and everyone receives a chance to shine as the wedding party goes on.\n\n&quot;Svadba&quot; presents us a glimpse of Russian society; in a manner similar to India&apos;s &quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot; or Mexico&apos;s &quot;El Anzuelo&quot;, the wedding is an event that serves as backbone to the stories of the family friends and relatives, from the sister who can&apos;t find a boyfriend to the town&apos;s police chief, who wants nothing but to leave the small village.\n\nAnother point that is handled with subtlety by the movie, is the new society of post-Communist Russia. In the small village that seems lost in time, Moscow is like a dream, where capitalism runs rampant and where everything is to be possible. However, Tania returns home looking for a quieter way of life, and the inhabitants of her hometown represent that lost innocence she struggles to recover.\n\nThe movie is a light-hearted comedy with touches of drama that has enough charm to capture the attention without getting boring, or overtly sentimentalist. This is a movie that proves that all a movie needs to be good is a lot of heart. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "My Aunt mentioned she loves &quot;16 Candles&quot;, and it has been more than 12 years since I&apos;d seen it, so we rewatched it. I&apos;ve probably seen it half a dozen times earlier, but too young for it in the theater. For John Hughes earlier entry and his directorial debut - credit to him on picking and filming a very close to or actual 16 year-old Molly Ringwald for the title role. And while I really liked Michael Schoeffling for the tender main crush, he was obviously too old looking as a Senior (an easy 24 playing an 18 yro), a small quibble. His character suave, collected, and sensitive was a great counterbalance in tone to most of other characters. However the tone of the movie generally is a bit too goofy for its own good, and the humor with &quot;Long Duk Dong&quot; is tasteless, poor, and hasn&apos;t aged well. There are some well-written scenes to keep the movie together, particularly with Dooley and Ringwald, Hall and Ringwald, and the memorable finale scene that one doesn&apos;t forget with Schoeffling and Ringwald in the fantastic last 2 scenes. These are much needed scenes lifting the movie just out mediocrity, and the movie could&apos;ve been much better focusing on the drama and cutting a good chunk of light humor. I give &quot;16 candles&quot; a high 6/10, round it up to a 7/10. Its in the top 5 or so of Hughes films - it has some flaws but also some touching moments.",

It&apos;s a road movie about a small group of damaged characters in search of some undefined salvation in the form of a huckster who claims that angels exist. The Forrest Whitaker character, Joey, bothered me the most. The slow-witted crazy man with a heart of gold, who takes care of the paraplegic singer played by Renee Zellweger. The character is a movie cliché, straight out of Of Mice And Men, and Whitaker didn&apos;t bring anything new to it. Is he schizophrenic and off his meds? Is he bipolar and off his meds? Whatever, he only shows up in movies, not in real life. At one point, late in the story, there is a diversion into the &quot;legend&quot; of Robert Johnson losing his soul at the Crossroads in exchange for a supernatural ability on the guitar. Then: on to something else. It goes nowhere. What was the point? Is our little band of characters somehow like Robert Johnson? Apparently not, because the next sequence is a high-speed car chase down highway 61. There were some nice moments, but they were poorly strung together.",

The deranged, mutilated, gory killer in this film is nothing short of horrific. The director&apos;s use of camera angles and quick edits adds to the suspense and explicit gore. The last scene was very riveting and suspenseful. Although many might believe this is a terrible movie, it truly isn&apos;t. You must understand the motivation and drive of the director in order to contemplate his technique and film-making attributes. This is a fascinating and abstract film. It is one of the best independent horror films I have come across in years. It is worth seeing this film. You must be a true horror film fan in order to enjoy this film.",

      "reviewBody": "In France, Xavier (Romain Duris) is a young economist of twenty and something years, trying to get a job in a governmental department through a friend of his father. He is advised to have a specialization in Spanish economy and language to get a good position. He decides to apply in an European exchange program called &quot;Erasmus&quot; and move to Barcelona to improve his knowledges in Spanish culture and language. She leaves his girlfriend Martine (Audry Tautou), promising to keep a close contact with her, and once in Barcelona, he is temporarily lodged by a French doctor Jean-Michel (Xavier de Guillebon) and his young and lonely wife Anne-Sophie (Judith Godrèche) he had met in the airport. Later, he moves to an apartment with international students: the English Wendy (Kelly Reilly), the Spanish Soledad (Cristina Brondo), the Italian Alessandro (Fédérico D&apos;anna), the Danish Lars (Christian Pagh) and the German Tobias (Barnaby Metschurat). Then the Belgium Isabelle (Cécile de France) and Wendy&apos;s brother William (Kevin Bishop) join the group, and Xavier learns Spanish language, and finds friendship and love in his experience living abroad. &quot;L&apos; Auberge Espagnole&quot; is one of those movies the viewer becomes sad when it ends. The story is a delightful and funny tale of friendship and love, in a globalized world and an unified Europe. This very charming movie made me feel good and happy, although I have never experienced to live in a republic of students. The newcomer William provokes the funniest situations along the story, with his big mouth and short brain. Further, it great to see a fresh approach of students living together different from those dumb American fraternities and their stereotypes, common in American movies. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Albergue Espanhol&quot; (Spanish Auberge&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Don&apos;t Look in the Basement&quot; is a very, very cheaply made film. Nothing about it seems very professional.yet, oddly, the film is quite entertaining. Is it really good? Nah—but very entertaining providing you are the type person who can appreciate such an odd film! \n\nThis movie is set in some sort of sanitarium for the mentally ill—the very, very, VERY mentally ill. No attempt is made to make these folks seem real and it has about the same level of insensitivity you&apos;d find in &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;. I have worked in a psychiatric hospital many years ago, and it was NOTHING like this place! It&apos;s pretty obvious they did not film it in a real hospital and just looks like an old house was used. And, for the parts, the &apos;patients&apos; were told to act very stereotypically insane—like you might expect folks to do on &quot;Whose Line is it Anyway?&quot;—subtle, it ain&apos;t! When the doctor (whose methods seem no saner than his patients) is killed by one of the patients, another doctor takes his place. Soon, a new nurse arrives—and she&apos;s shocked at how ineffective and stupid the treatment is for the patients. Eventually, more folks start dying and only then do you learn some very interesting secrets. I&apos;d say more, but I really don&apos;t want to spoil the suspense.\n\nThis engaging film looks like if you were to remake &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot; and had it rewritten by an actively psychotic individual! It&apos;s bloody, it&apos;s scary and, what I really like is that you really have no idea who, if anyone, is sane in this film! It&apos;s one of those ultra-low budget films with no-name casts that manages to work in spite of all the many strikes against it! Clever, strange and probably not for all tastes! If you like &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;, &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (the original one) or &quot;Spider Baby&quot;, then this film is for you!",

      "reviewBody": "Sucessful lawyer Robert Dean is passed information by an old friend without noticing. Seconds later that friend is killed and Dean is targeted by a group within the Government who wish to cover up a conspiracy involving the murder of a congressman. With the Government&apos;s full weight of surveillance equipment brought to bear Dean turns to ex-NSA agent Brill to help protect him, find the information and get it out into the open.\n\nThis is much better than the ususal summer crash, bang, wallop stuff we usually get fed. It&apos;s greatly helped by the sense of paranonia that runs through the whole story from the Government&apos;s power and corruption at some levels. The film starts well, with &apos;everyman&apos; Dean being drawn into a game of cat and mouse, framed for a crime he didn&apos;t commit and forced to go on the run from Government agents. Will Smith carries the film only so far but it realy gets interesting when Hackman turns up as Brill. He casts light on the ability of the government and is almost able to play them at their own game. Brill makes an appearance when the film starts to become too much of a staight chase movie.\n\nTo me the use of Hackman as Brill is the best bit of casting ever and makes this film stand out as being clever. In the 70&apos;s Hackman played a surveillance expert in Copolla&apos;s The Conversation. The film ends with Hackman being monitored himself, with him ripping his house apart looking for the bugs. What makes his casting as Brill so good is that Brill is where Hackman&apos;s &quot;The Conversation&quot; character would be 20 years on - it feels like it&apos;s the same character again. The director also deserves a lot of praise - he manages to keep the pace up throughout the film, whether it be scenes of chasing action or technological pursuit. The script helps as well - the conspiracy and the paranoia is strong throughout.\n\nSmith is good in the lead, but he isn&apos;t quite as good an &quot;everyman&quot; as classic actors as Cary Grant or James Stewart were. Smith also struggles to carry the whole movie and the chases do get a bit samey after a while. Fortunately Hackman is brilliant as Brill, he is a classy actor and brings a lot of weight to the film just as Smith begins to feel the strain. Jon Voight is also good as the villian of the piece. The supporting cast is deep! There were so many famous faces in small roles that I really felt this was an allstar cast, despite the fact that it&apos;s a Smith vehicle. Gabriel Byrne makes a fleeting appearance, Ian Hart is there, Jake Busey (son of Gary) shows up, Jason Lee (actor in many Kevin Smith films) witnesses the murder, a gorgeous Lisa Bonet has a small part, James Le Gros, Regina King etc etc. The cast is well packed with famous faces - they don&apos;t all get the chance to put on a show but it adds quality at all levels.\n\nOverall this is a fancy chase movie, but good direction, a strong and deep cast and a fantastic Hackman all make this film much better than it could have been. The last scene of the film is a little too upbeat but other than that it&apos;s pretty good stuff."

      "reviewBody": "The picture talks on the police agent called Storm(Seagal)whose family is wiped out by a corrupt politician, he is severely wounded and spends several years in coma.He awakes and executes a terrible vendetta, the happenings go out of control ,causing an incredible body-count against numerous evil-doers(William Sadler,Branscombe Richmond).He is only helped by a gorgeous nurse(his wife Kelly Le Brock,now days is divorced)and a good cop(Frederick Coffin). The film is combined of unstopped action,shoot out,violence,fighting, romance between both protagonists and a minimum characterization.Beside abundant fist fights in which body parts are slice off and limbs are slit or blasted apart.Savage and brutal killings make only recommended for those adults no squeamish and with strong stomach enough to take it.The movie gets a certain similarity with Charles Bronson films from ¨Death wish¨series for the matter,the avenger,thus the main personage ,the Vigilante, makes of judge,jury and executioner.It&apos;s a run a mill action movie because from the start until the end the action packed is continued ,in fact ,the final confrontation is breathtaking and extremely violent.The film is from Steven Seagal first period when the movies were of middling or high budget(Above the law,Marked for death,Out of justice,On deadly ground,The patriot),nowdays are of bow budget(Out of kill,Submerged,Foreigner,Black Dawn). The picture has an atmospheric synthesizer music fitting to action by David Michael Frank,nicely cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti and is well realized by Bruce Malmuth.The motion picture provides fast and furious amusing and action nonstop with no sense developed with fast pace and movement.It&apos;s a must for the Seagal fans.",

Same screenwriter, but I was way off track. I can stomach a lot, having no problem stuffing down popcorn during very graphic scenes. In 8MM, my coke had trouble going down. 8MM did not have consistent gory/violent scenes, but the way the movie was made made you fill in the blanks of what the makers of the movie could not screen. And if you pay attention and immerse yourself, you fill in more blanks than you really think you could, or want. As Max put it: &quot;the devil changes you.&quot; The perversity and deep rottenness of the human minds displayed in 8MM is what disturbs you. Then you realize, that &quot;snuff&quot;-movies are real, that there are individuals twisted enough to endorse/enjoy/take part in it. And worst of all, that these individuals don&apos;t look like monsters, they&apos;re perhaps just overweight nearsighted men who look like your dad, your son, your brother, even yourself. And if you don&apos;t look out,(no matter how secluded you think you are in your suburban home, with a wife, a daughter, and a dog named Shep) you dive into the pit of perversion and rottenness as well, finding no way out. In conclusion: excellent music, acting very sufficient, the plot: a must see. Just don&apos;t bring popcorn, and prepare to walk out of the movie theatre disturbed, asking questions, and a little bit more suspicious of those walking around you, and yourself."

      "reviewBody": "In Thursday 4th May Chuck Norris arrived in Ljubljana Slovenia and he visit us to make a car commercial. He stays by us till tomorrow then he returns back to his homeland. I love Chuck Norris I grew up watching his movies and Missing in Action defines my childhood and I grew up watching this movie. I am writing this review in honor of Chuck Norris. Slovenia loves Chuck Norris! \n\nMissing In Action is an underrated solid, very decent, good, pure bad-ass action war flick. It is my number 1 favorite Chuck Norris movie! I love this movie to death and I have it on Blu-ray in Hi-def in my collection. I love the music score from Jay Chattaway it is a beautiful score. it is rated Hard-R RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. It is not for kids it is a pure sample entertaining flick, it has explosions, a lot of gun shootouts, martial arts, climbing the electric wire and walls, you have even bobby traps, you see a lot of boats on the water, a lots of jungle and it is one-man army action hero type. One man on a mission to find American POW&apos;s who are still imprisoned in the country. You&apos;ll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you&apos;ll see them used well. This is my favorite Chuck Norris film for the simple fact that it has one of the best action hero moments ever with Braddock coming out of the water in super slo- mo and blasting bad guys to pieces.\n\nMissing in Action and Missing in Action 2: The Beginning were made back-to-back, with part 2 being ready first, so they released it as this movie, Missing in Action. I am defending this film: Why I am keep hearing from film critics and assholes like Maziun who has no dick about movies how bad this movie is, it is as a rip-off of the Rambo film series. Rambo was better, Rambo was looking for American POW&apos;s and blah, blah, blah! Shut up all of you!! Missing in Action and Chuck Norris is not yours kind of type action hero or his movies, they are just not for you so f**k You! \n\n&quot;It was more like 20,000. Why don&apos;t you tell us why there was a price on my head?&quot; *For your war crimes, of course.* , &quot;For killing assholes like you!&quot; \n\nI am big fan of Rambo movies I love all of them, but Missing in Action is different Vietnam action-War movie who is really fictional portrayed. The movie is not perfect, it is not great, realistic, or the best it does have a plot holes which I am little confused but I love Colonel James Braddock I love the character portrayed. Chuck Norris does a fine and solid job as the hero. I love the action the rescue mission I love this movie from the 80&apos;s and I miss these kind of action movies today. They don&apos;t make&apos;em like this anymore. He saves people, he saves 4 American POW prisoners and he help them I love the ending of the movie. I love the jungle I love how Col. James Braddock (Chuck Norris) uses the M60 during the POW rescue mission and he opens fire with the M60 mounted on the fast boat classic scene and he blast all the bad guys away.\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of Chuck Norris sneaking around in this movie more than Norris smashing guys, but that&apos;s present too. Norris doesn&apos;t take any crap, and I love the muscle duel between him and one enemy where Chuck slaps a knife right into his heart, literally. James Hong makes an appearance as General Trau as the villain and he&apos;s good at his job. He constantly taunts Braddock until Braddock literally attacks Trau in his sleep! The movie really lets you know where they stand on the issue of whether or not there are POWs being secretly kept in Vietnam with its exhilarating, &quot;In your face, Vietnamese government!&quot; ending.\n\nMissing in Action get&apos;s 8/10 it my favorite Chuck Norris film a brisk action/adventure with good old Chuck playing a stoic American super soldier fighting for America&apos;s freedom no matter the risks. It&apos;s a great Regan-era action flick, unapologetic and brutal.\n\nMissing in Action is a 1984 American action film directed by Joseph Zito and starring Chuck Norris. It is set in the context of the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. Colonel Braddock, who escaped a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp 10 years earlier, returns to Vietnam to find American soldiers listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War. The film was followed by a prequel, Missing in Action 2: The Beginning (1985), and a sequel, Braddock: Missing in Action III (1988).\n\n8/10 Grade: B Studio: The Cannon Group, Inc.

But more than that, it&apos;s a soft, positive look at relationships in South Central. Janet Jackson plays the title character, who accompanies some friends to Oakland. While the movie does have some intense scenes, the poetry narration - hence the title - moves everything along.\n\nReleased the year after the Rodney King riots, it shows the desperate situation in which large numbers of people in South Central live, making efforts to get by without trouble (no easy task). These are complex characters, each with something to add. I recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt I&apos;ll see a better one this year. This beautiful tragicomedy by Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage is set in the industrial wastelands of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) for him. To do this the son has to break the record opening doors. What the father actually wants his for his son to be someone, because he himself has never made it further as the reporter of local news for a newspaper ironically called L&apos;Espoir (Hope). Of course nothing works out as planned. This film can best be compared to Aki Kaurismäki&apos;s DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it is more dramatic and the humour is darker. Just like in that film however the tone is more melancholic than depressing and the ending upbeat, without being unrealistically happy. The humour is absurd, without making the plot unbelievable, and Mariage finds stunning images in the bleak settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the acting by Poelvoorde. This actor shot to fame with the also brilliant cult-classic C&apos;EST ARRIVÉ PRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS in which he played the charismatic hitman Ben. Since then he only played two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting capabilities and all the roles he was offered were reprises of the Ben character. With his return to a leading role in LCA there should be no doubt anymore about his acting. He&apos;s simply brilliant as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery, but smart enough to realize what he&apos;s done and be torn by remorse about it. A must see.",

      "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t think any film that managed to finish its shooting schedule and be released ever had as much problems as Trader Horn. So much so that for 20 years no American film company ever went back to Africa for location shooting until The African Queen and King Solomon&apos;s Mines. But so much footage survived that MGM was able to stock a series of Tarzan films and not put its players at risk the way Harry Carey, Duncan Renaldo and Edwina Booth were.\n\nThe plot is a skimpy one. Carey is your basic white hunter who is taking along a young friend Renaldo into some unexplored country in search of missionary Olive Carey&apos;s daughter. When they find her she&apos;s now the princess of a savage tribe. But one look at these two, especially Renaldo, makes her realize there are others who look like her. After that it&apos;s the three of them plus Carey&apos;s gunbearer on the run from the tribe and without weapons in the jungle.\n\nWhile American companies avoided Africa, colonial powers like Great Britain shot films in Africa and did it because they knew what the hazards were and took precautions. The goring of a young native by a rhinoceros is real and captured on film and frightening. Director Woody Van Dyke kept his cast and crew loaded with gin and quinine. It still did not save Edwina Booth from a rare tropical disease which many thought killed her. I&apos;ve always believed that was a deliberate publicity stunt by MGM because Ms. Booth was through with show business after this shoot. Who could blame her?\n\nThe first half of the film is a travelogue on safari. At the time this was great stuff for the American movie-going public. Still no studio wanted to face the expenses MGM had during Trader Horn&apos;s shooting.",

      "reviewBody": "This &quot;Letters from a Dead Man&quot; simply has got to be, hands down, one of the top three most depressing and pessimistic movies I ever encountered in my life. Of all Sci-Fi films dealing with remnants of life after the apocalypse – and believe me they are quite numerous – this Soviet Union produced sleeper upraises the most nightmarishly realistic and harrowing atmosphere ever. Even in your worst imaginable nightmares and premonitions, the post-nuclear existence probably still doesn&apos;t look as decayed and melancholic as illustrated here in this film. Survivors are forced to live underground, in the caves and catacombs of destroyed buildings, and have little else to do but watch each other fading away emotionally as well as physically. They can&apos;t go the surface without wearing special outfits and gas masks, but even then there&apos;s nothing else to do but stroll around between ruins, car wrecks and rotting corpses. With monotonous photography and the exclusive use of a yellow-tinted picture, director Konstantin Lopushansky (an acolyte of the Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky) fabricates the ideally lugubrious ambiance, and he can also rely on the devoted cast and bleakly void screenplay to assist.\n\nThe story revolves on Rolan Bykov as a scientist – former Nobel Price winner, even – who entrenched himself underneath the remnants of a library building along with his wife and a handful of co-workers. The titular letters are addressed to his son whom the scientist hasn&apos;t seen or heard from since the catastrophe. The letters and above all the hope his son is still alive somewhere is what keeps the poor man going, but how long can you hold on to hope when you see everything and everyone around you dying? &quot;Letters from a Dead Man&quot; is a difficult but ultimately very rewarding cinematic experience to endure. Difficult, of course, because of the emotionally devastating imagery and atmosphere, and because there&apos;s actually very little substantial content. We literally stare at a handful of people languishing and eventually dying, with only a small hint at hope near the end. And rewarding because of the depiction of genuine humane sentiments and the thought-provoking messages. It&apos;s also highly remarkable how &quot;Letters from a Dead Man&quot; remains continuously vague regarding the cause of the apocalypse and eventually even searches the guilt in the own heart. In a time where movies released on the other side of the Iron Curtain (in Europe and particularly the USA) routinely blamed Russia for the potentially upcoming apocalypse, this tale suggests the root cause of the catastrophe lies in a human error during the launch of a space shuttle. The entire cast gives away tremendous performances. I don&apos;t know if these people are veteran actors and actresses in their home countries, but their grimaces and catatonic behavior suggest that they were selected especially for this type of discouraging parable. Fantastic film; though obviously not fit for all occasions and/or audiences.",

George Axelrod&apos;s reworking of Sidney Gilliat&apos;s screenplay adds a nice screwball touch with his one-liners and Ian Carmichael and Arthur Lowe as the cricket-obsessed British tourists add humanity to their chauvinistic bullishness. And as a self-confessed Angela Lansbury fan I of course relished her depiction of Miss Froy. On a big cinema screen this looks terrific.",

Nice, from cast to story, delicious superficial and just charming.\n\nA love story, a guardian angel, very efficient, a racing driver, a not desired marriage perspective of a princess and , no doubts, a very young Romy Schneider , beautiful and remembering sparkles of Sissi series.\n\nIt is very easy to critic this too naif film , but its spring fresh can be a not so bad gift.\n\nYes, the potential of story is more significant than the modest result but few young actors and their reasonable work are enough for not be very dessapointed.\n\nSo, a nice film about love and a very - very efficient guardian angel."

Three lesbians, a straight girl, and a most charming gay guy. Only one of the five is &quot;out&quot; with her family, and her activist mother decides to invite the five for a weekend at her country house at the same time as their parents.\n\nThis is the recipe for a very special get together, and the parents end up being just as interesting and as their offspring.  The film develops into the kind of warm, witty farce, which the French seem to master so well.\n\nThe director, Stephane Giusti, is really talented and can be compared to Spain&apos;s Pedro Almodovar. A refreshing naivety, strong cast performances, and a surprisingly well-rounded act by Johnny Hallyday have made this film one of my all time favorites."

In the old movie he was a captain and only at the final he was promoted colonel.\n\nIndeed, in the old movie Strogoff was put to a blinding torture by the enemies, however he managed to avoid the blinding itself (watch that movie to see how). Therefore, the fact he is not blind now, does not make this movie a prequel.\n\nAs for the story, the old movie does not follow the Jules Verne book so closely. I found the best match with the book in the 1937 movie, The Soldier and the Lady. Pity it&apos;s a B/W one."

I have to admit, Jellyfish (or as it is known in Isreal as Meduzot)suffers from one too many unresolved plot lines. One plot line is a young woman who finds a nameless young girl who follows her around after a day at the beach. Another is a pair of newlyweds who seem to have a rash of bad luck on their wedding day. There are at least a couple of other plot lines, that don&apos;t even attempt at any kind of cohesive whole. The acting seems to be on the mark, but I just couldn&apos;t find any kind of narrative thread to hold it all together. Hava Nagila, indeed.",

To be blunt, the film is only a pretext to get very famous names on the screen for 5 seconds or 5 minutes on a flimsy pretense of a script. Varda is lucky: she has the clout and longevity in cinema that allows her to call on all these big names and get an answer (heaven, even Robert de Niro and Harrison Ford showed up for their cameos!) but there is no plot, or a sophomoric one, and hardly any thread to get moved by. It is a nice collection of cinematic quotations, visual or oral, and a nutty collection of famous faces that were asked to show up probably only to increase the chances of this dud to interest any audience. It is light and inoffensive, but so silly at time that one is bewildered: all that time and money for this self absorbed nonsense? An homage to cinema? Naw. Mostly of waste of time for all involved. I am glad Varda has done many better films to be remembered by.",

      "reviewBody": "Robin Woods in his fascinating new book of criticism &quot;Sexual Politics and Narrative Film&quot; writes eloquently about this film as a defining example of Ozu&apos;s films progressive nature. I would agree and add wholeheartedly that even after reading Wood&apos;s non-traditional take on Ozu I was still blown away by the film&apos;s rich identification with the character of Noriko (played by the legendary Setsuko Hara). The story is simple: Noriko a single Japanese woman is living a seemingly happy life caring for her widowed aging father. Social pressures, however, force family and friends to believe that Noriko can only be fulfilled by entering into marriage, although Noriko seems to have no interest in marriage herself. With this simple narrative Ozu is able to create a relationship between his characters that is so rich and complete we feel we know them. As always this is done with the smallest of carefully studied behavior and the precision of mise-en-scene over fancy editing and dazzling camera movements. A wonderful, heartbreakingly real movie from one of Japan&apos;s greatest directors.",

      "reviewBody": "Kenji Mizoguchi, an important figure in the history of Japanese cinema, is very well known for his collaboration on the portrayal of Japanese women on screen; one of the first reasons for this being his sister, who was sold to a geisha house by his father&apos;s decision. This highly contributed to his attachment to highlighting women on his films.\n\nThis is another film where geishas and their lives are involved. The story concerns one geisha and her apprentice, who is supposed to have the will to take the training into full practice and seriousness. Everything seemed fine when the training was in process, but when it came to conclusion, Eiko (the apprentice) had to debut as a geisha, but could not bring herself to accept her chosen client. Likewise, Miyoharu (Eiko&apos;s trainer), finds trouble when rejecting a client in love with her. Both rejected clients happened to be wealthy businessmen important to the geisha house where they worked, thus finding problems from there on.\n\nWhile the film may not be Mizoguchi&apos;s best, I can assure it is a wonderful joy to behold its cinematography. The camera positions and movements are just something to appreciate, accompanied by a totally honest and credible acting by pretty much every actor/actress involved.\n\nIf you have liked everything you have seen from this wonderful director, there is absolutely not any reason why you should not get your hands on this film.\n\nMy score: 7.5/10",

      "reviewBody": "A title like &apos;&apos;Two On A Guillotine&apos;&apos; leaves one expecting some first-class horror. Alas, in this glossy Warner Brothers programmer, that&apos;s not what you get. The plot, which is as old as the hills, deals with the long-estranged daughter of a magician (Connie Stevens, star of Television&apos;s &apos;&apos;Hawaiian Eye&apos;&apos;) who is left her deceased father&apos;s fortune, with one stipulation-she must spend one week in his mansion in order to collect it. Years before, Dad&apos;s wife (Stevens again) disappeared without a trace, leaving his daughter to be raised by relatives. At her father&apos;s funeral, she is reunited with her one-time Nursemaid (Virginia Gregg) and her father&apos;s business manager (Parley Baer) both of whom will split the inheritance should Connie split before the week is up. Quickly befriended by an incognito reporter, (Dean Jones) Connie makes her way to the house for what should have been a living nightmare. But it goes (slowly) downhill from there.Producer/Director William Conrad had quite a showbiz career-he played Marshall Dillon on radio long before James Arness played the part on the TV series &apos;&apos;Gunsmoke&apos;&apos;. In the 70&apos;s Conrad was &apos;&apos;Cannon&apos;&apos; the star of his own successful TV show, and he ended his run starring in another successful detective series &apos;&apos;Jake And The Fatman&apos;&apos;.As the director of this film, however,( as well as the following year&apos;s &apos;&apos;My Blood Runs Cold&apos;&apos;), he started with practically nothing, and did little more with it.Max Steiner contributes a suitably eerie score (his last) and the black and white photography is excellent. But neither can disguise the fact that very little is actually happening.Stevens and Jones are given insipid characters to play but do what they can with them which, sadly, isn&apos;t much. Poor Connie is also victimized by her unflattering hairstyles-including one that looks like she&apos;s wearing a raccoon (complete with tail)on her head. Both spend what feels like forever, plodding around the sadly unthreatening house, dodging an occasional plastic skeleton, and the usual rubber head bouncing down the stairs. Except for one or two ear-splitting shrieks from Stevens, neither seems all that concerned. Gregg (as usual) and Baer at least manage to make their parts interesting, even though they are merely red herrings. Connie Gilchrist is wasted in a bit as a housekeeper. Caesar Romero is properly pathetic as the mad magician, but he&apos;s not on screen enough.Worst of all, this film cries out for (but doesn&apos;t get) much more suspense, deeper characterizations and imaginative direction. Instead, Conrad tosses in a dull romantic subplot for Stevens and Jones,a visit to a local disco, an excursion to an amusement park and a song (?) from Stevens,who WAS recording for Warner Brothers Records at the time. But all this does is make an already overlong film that much longer. Even the supposedly &apos;&apos;shocking climax&apos;&apos; is dragged out unmercifully. Needless to say, this was a pretty weak wrap up to 50&apos;s starlet Steven&apos;s Warner Brothers contract.Incidentally, both she and Romero made personal appearances on behalf of the film (to no avail) when it opened in New York. Jones fared a bit better, going on to star in a few popular Walt Disney comedies. Romero, however, really triumphed the following year when he was perfectly cast as the flamboyant &apos;&apos; Joker&apos;&apos; in the &apos;&apos;Batman&apos;&apos; Television Series. Yes, there are so-called &apos;&apos;Horror Films&apos;&apos; out there a lot worse than this one. But there are much better ones as well.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is fun. And it&apos;s great in that it is remarkably fun, as opposed to &quot;about anything.&quot; If you can take it in context of &quot;Punk-Western&quot; as a &quot;rock&quot; movie and a western the bar is not set incredibly high to begin with, and this clears the hurdle with ease in merging two genres that usually droop into the exploitation movie quality level. Penelope Spheeris&apos;s prior works: Decline of Western Civilization and Suburbia were genuine and earnest portraits of punk-rock music, the first from a documentary perspective of the performers, and the second from the subjective fictional live of the fans of the genre. this is an attempt to launch these concepts into the language of mainstream genre cinema and succeeds better than adequately. Admirably, exceptionally, debate and quibble about the adjective. no matter what. this is approximately 1 1/2 hors of fun movie watching with that little extra to think about. And I occasionally entertain the bizarre notion of building a religion around Daredelvis. If one respects a youth culture as an anthropological phenomenon, tis film shines out as the &quot;punk&quot; take on westerns almost in the way that &quot;LITTLE BIG MAN&apos; was a 60&apos;s hippie western",

I ask because you did direct some awful films like Trivandrum Lodge and Poppins.\n\nThere was quite a bit of mystery to your film Nirnayakam. For a while, I did not know where the film was going. The structure was quite interesting. An impulsive young man&apos;s anomie and acedia as a cadet in the Indian army develops into a story about a social crusade. In the process, he finds himself.\n\nOverall, you did keep the ship from sinking. It was not a bad film. But I only watched it because my grandmother was watching it.\n\nEvery time I watch one of these new Malayalam movies, I&apos;m always thinking - the possibilities were endless. You could have taken this film in any direction if only you had the imagination.\n\nAsif Ali was decent as the confused protagonist. He is as bad an actor as Kunjacko Boban or Biju Menon. Which means he is tolerable. Which means he is going to be around for another 20 years. Mediocrity is the future. And you V.K.Prakash would assure it stays that way. I hope you made enough money in the last 12 years, man. I don&apos;t think I would watch your next film unless my wife or grandmother is watching it.\n\nBest Regards, Pimpin.\n\n(5/10)",

      "reviewBody": "To put it simply, this film is George Orwell&apos;s Animal Farm as told by the makers of Memento. It covers a dark subject, and embraces the darkness associated with it.\n\nThis film is set in a fictional country that takes elements from many utilitarian countries around the world to give us things to relate to. To me the most interesting was the Kim Jong-il analogy. A president for life who succeeds his father and is very interested in the film industry. Others will likely see other references.\n\nAs the film progresses, we follow this country through stages of governmental upheaval. We ride on the shoulder of an idealistic prison guard as he chooses sides, and faces the consequences of that choice.\n\nAs the movie was building, I felt like it was building a Pro-Terrorism Utopian government, but in the end I was left hopeless, because of each plot turn making the movie yet more dour.\n\nSymbolism abounds, and you will find yourself trying to locate the meanings of the symbols, which are perhaps a tad too convoluted for my tastes.\n\nI was completely immersed in the story, and I found the progression of the movie to be very compelling, but the overall message of hopelessness clashed with my youthful idealism.\n\nI recommend this movie as debate fodder for political theorists. Its dark themes limit its audience otherwise.",

      "reviewBody": "All I love about Rivette is in this film, and lots of it.\n\n(1) The actors create &apos;souls&apos;, personalities and stratagems for their characters in collaboration with Laurent, Bonitzer and Rivette, instead of reciting cut and dried parts. Piccoli, Béart, Birkin and the others work little miracles all the time: their interactions feel shrewd, humane, intense, both mysterious where some background is yet missing to the viewer and utterly believable once it is revealed, without trace of the usual high-strung film acting centered on the single significant moment and rammed down the public&apos;s throat in so many contemporary movies.\n\n (2) The setting, the Chateau d&apos;Assas, is completely integrated into and driving the story, and is cleverly employed and fully respected in the mise èn scéne: it is not a quarry for illustrative backdrops and environments, but a real space conditioning the story just like the  personalities involved.\n\n(3) The mise èn scéne and cadrage always leave the necessary breathing space and time for story and personality development and interaction. Nothing is ever forced or abbreviated - and yes, this makes movies longer.\n\nThe &apos;plot&apos; is typical for Rivette, as it contains a subtle fantastic element: here the idea, that a painter could find, sum up, condense and make visible the complete essence of a person in a painting. This fantasy lends urgency to the old dichotomies of life and art, of love and creativity. It is otherwise a mere pretext to set the story in motion and expose the characters. (In Balzac&apos;s &apos;Chef d-oeuvre inconnu&apos;, the attempt of Frenhofer to capture his model completely only led to a completely unreadable painting.)\n\nThe scenes where Marianne models for Frenhofer are to my knowledge  unique in cinema. They represent transparently both the very subtle interaction between painter and model, and the genesis of the resulting sketch.\n\nTo show spontaneous sketching of highest quality, the hand of Bertrand Dufour was filmed while drawing/painting the posing Béart. Then Piccoli incorporated the gestures of the hand of Dufour into the scenes of Frenhofer and Marianne. Given the complexity and freedom in their interaction, the tension and homogeneity of the assembled scenes is quite a miracle.\n\n No numerical vote, of course: one must never allow the quality of a piece of art to be in any way a subject to voting."

      "reviewBody": "Italian production typical of the genre with haunting scenarios , wonderful indoors and functional production design. Here Maciste (Mark Forest) arranges enemies for himself and he befriends a new pal called Bangor (Paul Wynter) to be captured by a strange band of white-clad marauders and taken to an underground city . There the two are forced to turn a huge wheel along with other captives as part of a gold-and-diamonds mining operation . The underground city&apos;s queen, Halis Mosab (Moira Orfei) , takes note of the bouncing Maciste and chooses him to be her consort if he can meet such challenges as saving the abducted Princess Saliura (Rafaella Carra) from a gigantic ape . Maciste faces off the ape and fights a deadly struggle with the giant gorilla . As Maciste is up to his pecs in trouble as he fights nasty Mole Men in order to save the abducted lady , carrying Saliura back to the aboveground world . As the bare-chested warrior goes on an all-out rampage to save her , being mercilessly chased by the mysterious masked warriors . Meanwhile, high priest Kahab informs his son, Katar (Gianni Garco) , that he has to marry the powerful queen to inherite the underground empire . Later on, Maciste must use his strength to rescue his friends and attack the hidden city . As he battles the evil queen and attempting to destroy the unstoppable wheeling machine .\n\nThis is a so-so spaghetti , myth-opera with action , love , battles and interior scenarios . The movie has not mythological accuracy neither expecting historical , but it results to be a simple and plain fantasy .

      "reviewBody": "First and foremost, if you haven&apos;t read the book or seen the film. Then please read the book first. Then if you want to afterwards, watch the film. Now I fully appreciate that novels, films, plays etc are all different forms of art and ways of telling stories, and people shouldn&apos;t always compare a film to the original book so harshly as most do. But immediately two books spring to mind that the writer of the novel has done a fantastic job, and so has the film in adapting it, I speak of, &apos;No Country for Old Men&apos; and &apos;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Cowards Robert Ford&apos;. However, with &apos;Mr. Nice&apos;, the book is greatly written, it is funny, witty, heartwarming and a general entertaining easy read which is fantastic coming from such an intelligent man who doesn&apos;t have to prove himself by filling the novel with big clever words. But what he does do is fill it will the entirety of his life that makes for a fun and interesting read, that creates characters in your head you can picture so well and understand, and even at the end of wish you could of been apart of his life (for the good times anyway). Now the best way to describe what Bernard Rose did to the book to make the film was simply pick it up, and flick through it all in the that quick motion we can do with our thumb, letting the pages slide by and fan us as it goes. This is what the film felt like to me. It had no structure in terms of story to it, just episodes of the book he could pick out with his eyes as the pages flew past him and then shot it, and in the editing room tried to string them together to get some sort of story out it. Even if I hadn&apos;t read the book before and knew all that Rose had left out, I still wouldn&apos;t have connected with any of the characters on the screen or the story itself. You may say that a four hundred page book is difficult to squeeze into a two hour film, and that is fair enough, but I ask you to only look towards what Jackson and Walsh did for the LOTR. This then leads me to believe that Rose has no real writing skills and doesn&apos;t really no what a story is. Nor editing for that matter. But what annoyed me the most I think for this film is the total lack of knowledge towards the characters he was portraying on the film, now I may have read the book differently, and this is just my opinion, but I don&apos;t feel any of the characters were captured at all on the screen, especially Jim McCann, and every scene never went anywhere or made me feel anything towards them or the connection they should have with another. Like I said before, it just felt like Rose had took bits of the book out and tried stringing them together, giving us no real story or character arc. The only saving grace for this film for me was the fact that Rose remembered to put in a few of the good bits from the book itself, such as the funny scene in both book and film of when McCann and Marks are trying to talk to each other over the radio.",

Its theme of how the human race almost put an end to itself was presented in a very simple, bleak and thought provoking manner by its director Arch Obelor.  I often remember that movie as my first and most impressionable &quot;end of mankind&quot; movies.  It was made on a shoestring budget, with unknown actors and yet I consider it the most powerful film of that genre.  I have not seen it on television since and cannot find it on video.  I still can envision that night as a young teen, after having viewed that movie, thinking of our world, our future and what humankind is capable of.  Wherever a print of that film is, I wish our present generation could view it as food for thought.  Thank-you for allowing me to express my opinions on a forgotten &quot;little&quot; film."

It is a very simple, interesting and charming film about a heart-broken and serious guy who meets an extremely vivacious and talkative girl who gradually manages to change his perception of life and love. And then, the story turns over in a rather interesting way. The film works better in the first half, as it is more alluring and funny. It later turns into a mini-drama but still in a natural way with a lot of comedy and fun. The music is great and each song contributes to the film&apos;s mood in its own way. The film stars Shahid Kapoor in a greatly restrained and impressive act as Aditya, but it is Kareena Kapoor&apos;s film all the way. Her comic timing is top-notch, and she is charming, convincing and full of life as the unforgettable Geet. Later on she also provides some superbly acted dramatic scenes, which she plays with unusual restraint and depth. Jab We Met is a very memorable picture, extremely entertaining and uplifting, and definitely a must-see for those who enjoy pleasant, comic and romantic flicks.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Tobe Hooper somewhat returns to his rural horror roots (think of &apos;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&apos; and &apos;Eaten Alive&apos;) with the better than expected low-budget b-grade &apos;Mortuary&apos;. Just like those early Hooper features, &apos;Mortuary&apos; sets the unyieldingly growing horror (tagged with humorous strokes) at an isolated location (where it&apos;s a baleful rundown funeral home with a cemetery). But like others have mentioned, after getting off to a good start (very tidy and eerie) with some good looking production designs it eventually goes on to loose shape and become a kinetic mess with some vague developments and questionably dismal computer special effects, but the decomposed make-up FX remains effective. Nonetheless I still enjoyed it, even with the blatant faults.\n\nThe story follows the Doyle family; Leslie Doyle and her teenage son Jonathan and younger daughter Jamie moving to rustic California to start a new business in what was known as the &apos;The Flower Brother&apos; Funeral Home&apos;. Having been abandoned for quite a while, the place doesn&apos;t look too crash hot and its hazardously clogged septic tank is leaking sewage. But the place holds a horrific history, as the locals believe it to be haunted and the Doyle&apos;s come to realize there&apos;s some truth to the urban legend of Bobby Fowler. But also they must content with a strange fungus substance coming from their grounds, which transforms the dead and living into zombie-like creations.\n\nThe set-up might not be anything special (while routine, Hooper&apos;s direction is surely crafted and well-paced), but the idea behind the terror has some spirited imagination (very Lovecraft like), despite the fatuous nature of it all when revealed. This helps it lean towards a wicked sense of humour. In the early stages it really does enough to pull you in with its underlining creepiness with sharp photography, robust score and atmospheric art direction where it has dark figures lurking in the shadows and slight lighting. It&apos;s tightly controlled, as the jolts have no real build-up (although that does occur in the latter half) and are quickly over with some off-screen action happening. Strangely this worked, but when it decided to break out (soon after the fairly intense dinner table scene) it just felt predictably strained, repetitive and overlong with a vastly abrupt and perplexing closing. The willing performances are modest at best. Denise Crosby is good fun. A twitchy Dan Byrd is appealing and Stephanie Patton suitably adds innocence. There are some spunky ladies in Alexandria Adi and Courtney Patton. Lee Garlington is amusing too.\n\nPredictable, but a solidly entertaining offering with a certain ominous ambiance and cheap thrills.",

It is the classic one-of-every-kind sort of group. There are a few minor funny moments, but some downright awkward ones too. The action scenes with the actors are limited. They fill the rest out with real footage from different sides of the war and different battle locations. Some are recognizable and classic. Some are new and impressive.

Beth brings the dog Freeway home and her daughter Grace (Elisabeth Moss) falls for the vet. At Grace&apos;s wedding in the mountains, their nephew Bryan (Mark Duplass) develops a crush on Carmen (Ayelet Zurer) who runs the place. Joseph&apos;s sister Penny (Dianne Wiest) has a new boyfriend Russell (Richard Jenkins) who is using her money to start a pub. Joseph carelessly loses the dog in the woods. It sets off a big search for Freeway.\n\nI&apos;m not sure if the stakes are high enough here. It&apos;s a bunch of family members with minor issues looking for a dog. It&apos;s not like the audience grows to love the dog. It&apos;s more of an excuse for each family member to work out their issues. Lawrence Kasdan and his wife have created the lightest and mildest of family drama. The great cast of actor showed up to play but the writing is not up to the task.",

(Even if the Nazis were attempting to buy legitimacy by co-opting the wellspring of Western civilization.)\n\nWhen I saw this film a couple of years ago, I actually thought I heard a couple of topical jokes slyly directed at the Nazis and assumed I was seeing the last gasp of some still independent liberal Weimar tradition. Maybe I was mistaken, and such a thing was no longer possible two years into the thousand-year Reich.",

As other reviewers have mentioned, each version starts with the inmate&apos;s last meal and what could have happened and his behaviour affected the prison director and staff in how they carried out his execution by lethal injection. The director always maintained that he had a rigid schedule and followed a specific script, but depending on Barlow&apos;s attitude and resulting behaviour and how he interacted wth the staff, the outcome was the same. An interesting concept that leaves viewers with room to debate about why Kevin Barlow acted the way he did and what may have been going through the warden&apos;s mind as he carried out the sentence.",

The film is very entertaining from the get-go with all three leading actors a lot of fun to watch. I am referring to Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart and Walter Brennan.\n\nThis was Bacall&apos;s first film. She was 19 years old, looked 30 and never looked better. Her face, at that time, was stunningly beautiful, mesmerizing at times. So is her dialog, capped off by the famous line, asking Bogart if he knows how to whistle. It isn&apos;t just the line, it&apos;s the way she says it.....and Bogart&apos;s reaction. Bogart is outstanding, just as he was in Casablanca. Same type of character: an apolitical American overseas who reluctantly winds up helping fight the Nazis. As for Brennan, normally I don&apos;t find drunks appealing, just sloppy and obnoxious. However, Brenenan is neither here; he&apos;&apos;s simply fun to watch and someone you can&apos;t help but like. I think he was one of the more underrated actors of his time.\n\nThe story had a good blend of intrigue, action, suspense, comedy, beautiful women, great characters and great dialog. It&apos;&apos;s too bad it has nowhere near the notoriety of Casablanca. It &apos;s only a small notch below it.",

      "reviewBody": "Zarah Leander was to German cinema of the 1930s what Garbo and Dietrich together were to Hollywood. She physically suggested Garbo and had the same deep, Swedish-accented voice. Unlike Garbo, and much like Dietrich, she often sang in her films while swathed in baroque costumes and tons of makeup and curlicued coiffures so as to convey an extreme artificiality. La Habanera, stylishly directed by Detlef Sierk (the future Douglas Sirk) and beautifully shot is the perfect vehicle for this lush romantic vision of the tropics. \n\nAstree, a young Swede, travels to Puerto Rico with her bilious old aunt, is so enraptured by the tropical atmosphere and the attentions of a local Don (Ferdinand Marian) that she jumps ship to stay there. Ten years later, she&apos;s miserable in the remorseless heat and torpidity, crushed by the realization that she made an impulsive mistake, married a man she didn&apos;t love and now is sentenced to remain trapped and homesick. Her only consolation is her son whom she estranges from his father, spoiling him, doting on him and singing him twee songs with lyrics about snowflakes on nose tips intertwined with melodic recitations of the letters of the alphabet. One would hope that by the age of 9 the boy would be ready for something a bit more advanced. A parallel plot line involves two Swedish scientists who travel to the island to research and develop a vaccine for the &quot;Puerto Rico Fever&quot; which blows in annually on a &quot;fever wind&quot; and sends people into comas from which they never emerge. The powerful Don does not want the world to think infectious fevers exist on the island – hurts business. So he connives to sabotage their efforts.\n\nThroughout the story the haunting but kitschy title song by Lothar Bruhne and Bruno Balz is sung by various groups of &quot;natives,&quot; used as underscoring and in a climactic scene, performed to the hilt by Leander and a Caribbean orchestra in one of most rapturous musical sequences of 1930&apos;s filmdom.\n\nThreaded through the plot are criticisms of the United States (via the Rockefeller Institute and a sly dig at President Roosevelt) and a suggestion that Nordic types are better off with their own kind. The depiction of Puerto Rico is pure fantasy, but no worse than the usual Hollywood image of Latin America of the period.",

      "reviewBody": "This is a movie that grips right away. While it has a dark setting, sparse but classic, the characters are rich. The love and care that Mike van Diem and the actors put in this film is visible. Thanks to significant contributions from both Dutch and Belgian TV stations, this movie is a rare treat, which is for once not spoiled by overly commercial requirements from demanding advertisers... As i understand, the film company First Floor Features had this film for decade(s?) in the planning, and it is a happy coincidence that it was realized the way you can enjoy it now. It has thus become a monument honoring the fabulous writer F. Bordewijk, the Dutch life and mind of the beginning 1900&apos;s, the craftsmanship of a dedicated cast, and a generous producer.\n\nJan Declair as the stony-hearted usher Dreverhaven is a character you won&apos;t forget for a long time. His softer side is time and again rejected by taciturn Joba, his former housekeeper who became pregnant in one lonely weak moment of them both. For several years, he offers her to marry her, or at least to contribute for the upbringing of his illegitimate son Kattedreuffe. She as many times rejects: &apos;We do not need anything.&apos; On a precarious occasion, Dreverhaven denounces Jacob Kattadreuffe nevertheless, and from that moment on, father and son have a harsh relation as well. -\n\nMasterfully, fate intertwines their lives, as the story unfolds. Real gems are present everywhere, the scenery is breathtakingly picturesque, partly filmed in Rotterdam harbor, and in other places like Belgium and Poland. The movie constantly plays with time, but in a plausible way. As an example, when Kattedreuffe has an appointment at a bailiff&apos;s office after being framed into bankruptcy, the name plate blinks at once with his own name on it. And indeed, he starts a career in this very office that same day.\n\nFor a while, the lives of father and son seem only occasionally to coincide, but it is a silence before the storm. Every picture draws to the dramatic end which was glimpsed as the opening scene: Did Kattadreuffe murder Dreverhaven? Many instances shown would allow this conclusion, as the two fatally attract each other to fulfill their inner tragedy. Dreverhaven as this hard and desperate &apos;keeper of the law&apos; who can not express love, and Kattadreuffe as the one who had to fight his whole life to arrive in a higher position, and then stands empty-handed, his love unreturned through his own stupidity (even his mother sees that Lorna Te George / Tamar van den Dop was an exquisite relation missed).\n\nTo kill (!) each other would suddenly seem like the best possibility and a liberation in such a dark hour, but the end has a surprise. The last minute smooths all the giant waves, and allows for a satisfying and ingenuous end scene. - Maybe you have to see this movie more than once to uncover the many hidden treasures, i strongly recommend to get it for yourself on DVD. The dark passionate music of &apos;Paleis van Boem&apos; enhances perfectly the impressive scenery. It is an artwork that has more than earned the Oscar it has got as best foreign film in 1998, along with numerous other awards.\n\nAnd i am proud to have been asked to participate with calligraphy and handwritten material, although it is only clearly visible in the last half minute when (my) hand writes the last words of the testament, undersigning with - (see for yourself!).",

This film is highly appreciate all round the ex-USSR, so if you somehow missed it - don&apos;t lose your chance.",

Then Fay double-crosses the abusive Vince and flees with the money to Reno. She hires the needy private investigator Jack Andrews (Val Kilmer), who grieves the death of his wife and owes ten thousand-dollars to loan sharks, to simulate her death telling that she wants to start a new life without her boyfriend. He accepts the offer and produces her fake death. However she betrays Andrews and escapes to Las Vegas without paying the rest of the money, leaving him as the prime suspect of her death for the police. Andrews finds Fay in Las Vegas and they have a love affair. Meanwhile the police, the mobsters and Vince hunt them down.\n\nDespite the flaws, &quot;Kill Me Again&quot; is a great neo-noir film with a sordid story. Michael Madsen is perfect in the role of a psychopath scum as well Val Kilmer in the role of a smalltime private investigator. Joanne Whalley does not have the profile of femme fatale but has a good performance. However, the plot point with Fay teaming up with Vince against Andrews after letting him hide the money is flawed. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Mate-me Outra Vez&quot; (&quot;Kill Me Again&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "@ 36th Hong Kong International Film Festival\n\nBy being the opening film of the 36th Hong Kong International Film Festival, Declaration of War is a film that touches the audience hearts, but more importantly it talks about real humans, real events, real emotions and real surroundings. For that alone director and main actress deserves a simple round of applause. It is not easy to go through a traumatic experience and come out strongly by telling her life story through films. This film works because the director never stray away from its core issue of a couple dealing with their child having a brain trauma and all the other issues that goes along with it – losing money, jobs, lifestyle, relationships and ultimately themselves. It should be complimented that the film yet is about to play with a sense of humor along the way.\n\nValerie Donzelli not only carries the film as the mother and wife, but directs a film that is so personal to her. It was my honour to meet such a strong lady at the festival. In the scene where she ran and ran in the hospital corridors until she collapses is a perfect example of originality in her camera work and her ability to depicts and communicate a difficult moment. Likewise her former partner Jeremie Elkaim excels in a role that compliments Valerie and two display amazing chemistry that cannot just be manufactured.\n\nAll in all, Declaration of War is very much a personal film, about how a child&apos;s illness can affect almost everything in his parents life. Dealing with difficult times like these is never easy and often the wear and tear will stop any couple from living their lives. Points should be given to Valerie for being able to so convincing portray these emotions. Although the film seems raw at times, War is very much a perfect example of how an extremely personal film can still affect the audience. While the film may never be a masterpiece, Valerie have certainly created and shared something special\n\nNeo rates 8.5/10\n\n\n* www.thehkneo.com\n",

Oscar&apos;s misanthropic lines are usually acerbic enough, and self-referential enough, to sound as though he wrote them himself.\n\nI was a little wary since this video is part of the Warner Brothers &quot;Doris Day Collection&quot;. But Doris is really quite winning. According to an anonymous and unsung IMDb contributor, Judy Garland was the first choice for Doris&apos;s part. That would have been a poor fit; the role certainly calls for someone lighter. The second choice, Betty Hutton, would have been a good one as well, but Lady Day (sorry) won me over. She sings a number of delightful songs -- she just happens to find a jazz combo on shipboard to accompany her -- and there is nothing here as risible as &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot;, the sugary kidnapping tune from &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s Magic&quot; is the showstopper.\n\nThe cruise ship makes several stops as it&apos;s travelling south: Cuba, Trinidad, Rio. A song in the Hollywood version of the local style generally erupts spontaneously. Busby Berkeley called the shots on these, and his influence is, shall we say, detectable. Jack Carson sings a calypso number in an unsteady Trini accent, but it&apos;s not too bad considering he was attempting it 50 years ago, mahn.\n\nTry booking a passage with this ship of fools the next time you&apos;re in need of a vacation."

      "reviewBody": "&apos;The Supernaturals&apos; is one of the most sinister horror films to come out of the 1980&apos;s. The location for this zombie flick is aptly used: somewhere in the &apos;sullen backwoods&apos; of America. We are, at first, introduced to a regiment of Confederate soldiers who are forced, by the Union forces - the 44th -  to walk across a section of woodland laced with mines. The entire regiment are blown to all four points of the compass, with the exception of Jeremy, a young boy dressed as a confederate. He, along with his mother, exhibits a seemingly unearthly power, which consequently saves his life. Fast-forward to the year 1985: a troup of U.S. soldiers - the 44th division - are on manouvers in the same backwoods. Little do they know what atrocities befell the original regiment of the 44th - until they unwittingly camp upon the same cursed ground. Radio contact fails, troops begin to disappear during their routine watch - all hell breaks loose, as the past catches up with the members of the 44th. The woods serve as an appropriate setting for this creepy horror movie, and there is - despite previous reviews - enough gore to keep the average horror fan entertained. However, what makes this film stand out from other zombie films, is the tight plot and the faultless directing. The use of the mist-shrouded woods, the &apos;seemingly&apos; disused underground bunkers and the ancient stone cottage - now a haven for the long-dead - create an eerie atmosphere. The sharpened tree branches see members of the 44th staked - vampire fashion. Mawell Caulfield (Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat; The Boys Next Door; Gettysburg: Waxwork 2: Lost in Time) shines, as ever, in this horror masterpiece!"

That said, I enjoyed the film and would recommend seeing it. The star of the film was certainly Rupert Grint who provided some of the best comedy moments, and Dame Eileen Atkins was a disappointment after her stellar performance in Psychoville. Some of the plot lines were predictable and could be seen coming, but in a way that added to the charm of the film. And it&apos;s always nice to see a proper British film as opposed to the ones we just make so well for Hollywood!",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is much more than a conventional romance, with the typical meet-cute sequence and plot-convenient obstacles that get neatly resolved. I&apos;m thinking of the typical American Meg-Ryan-Julia-Roberts movie, where everyone is inexplicably wealthy, no one has any real problems, and all the &quot;wrong&quot; boy/girl-friends are shrews or dorks ... so the audience has nothing to do but wait for the inevitable and unrealistic end.\n\nThis movie represents some other real-life complications, such as coping without a lot of money, and shows the characters struggling with, and taking responsibilities for, their relationships and commitments.\n\nThe two leads, Maggie Cheung &amp; Leon Lai, are terrific.  Also wonderful is the supporting performance by Eric Tsang as Pao Au-Yeung.  This is a thoughtful and beautiful movie about real people and real love.",

Lassie here is played by the very first and original Lassie collie---who was in most, not all, of the Lassie movies. There were nine Lassies. Today, April, 2005, we have the ninth Lassie, all descendants of this very first Lassie. Courage of Lassie is a sweet and very sad story at times with a plot and storyline particular to WWII and is is not unrealistic or spectacular. It is a family movie and a throwback to a time when Lassie movies were popular. It must be viewed in that light. I recommend it,as I would recommend all Lassie movies and I, personally, am looking forward to seeing the new Lassie movie currently being filmed.",

Even though this was filmed during the urban cowboy era of the early 80s, it doesn&apos;t seem dated in its subject matter. Country music fans can draw their own conclusions as to who inspired some of the characters. Robert Duvall&apos;s burnt-out drunk Mac Sledge surely borrowed from Lefty Frizzell. Mac&apos;s singing style is eerily close to Lefty&apos;s and he even performs one of his songs in the film. Betty Buckley&apos;s country queen Dixie Scott is reminiscent of Dottie West. Perhaps the writer based his story on George Jones and Tammy Wynette&apos;s bitter divorce, Jones&apos; subsequent alcoholism and redemption, and Tammy&apos;s raising of their daughter. Whatever the case, it has a wonderful message about loss making us appreciate the good things we&apos;re given in life. The final song playing while Tess Harper watches her husband and son tossing a football says it best."

      "reviewBody": "First of all, I&apos;d like to tell you this: I am male, 25, and I had no expectations whatsoever when I saw this, just thought it would be interesting to see. \n\nThe plot: An EVIL wizard, whose name of course is NECROMANCER, which is also what he does, more or less, has possessed the body of a young boy, and now his older sister and her sorta boyfriend has to save him (and the world), by defeating the necromancer, using the help of a deceased member of a secret society that used to fight necromancers in the olden days. They also get some help from a guy who conveniently has built a soul-catcher (what are the odds).. \n\nThe verdict: Although this movie isn&apos;t terrible, the leading actress really doesn&apos;t seem to have a clue about acting, and in many scenes she just has this blank stare and seems quite uninterested, making us lose some interest in the movie, where she feigns being scared, sad, etc.\n\nThe special effects are very well-made for a Danish movie, and most of the supporting cast does a good job. But the story and plot isn&apos;t very logical, and there are quite a few things that makes no sense, or are extremely far-fetched and laughable. \n\nAll this doesn&apos;t matter though, as Nicolai Arcel has hordes of thousands of fans that have seen KONGEKABALE, and almost every Dane (from &quot;Familien Danmark&quot;) just loves everything he or anyone else touches, especially if it looks like something straight out of Hollywood. I will not be popular for saying this, and I know many Danes will be mad at me for telling the truth here, as it apparently is every Danes duty to praise everything Nordisk Film (or whatever Danish film-distributor) makes, no matter how crappy it is. Especially stuff like &quot;Store Planer&quot; and &quot;Overcoming&quot;.\n\nBUT, not all I say is criticism, because this movie will be PERFECT for children, no doubt. If you have a child (or a child&apos;s brain), then this movie is the right choice. If you&apos;re an adult who likes good movies, then you will probably cringe at the acting and frown over the plot, although it may be somewhat entertaining on a lower level. 4/10",

      "reviewBody": "There are subtle films, there are unsubtle films and then there&apos;s &apos;Possession (1981)&apos;, a picture that cranks everything up to eleven and doesn&apos;t even think about adjusting the dials until its end credits have rolled. It&apos;s a very violent movie, and I&apos;m not just talking about violence in the traditional sense. Every movement feels like a convulsion, every reaction an explosion, every interaction a fight, every line of dialogue a visceral scream. Of course, there are also moments of more conventional conflict, eruptions of painful brutality that hit like a truck, but the piece is very aggressive for its entire duration. It&apos;s nihilistic, but not unreasonably nasty. Its characters tear themselves apart from the inside as they fruitlessly scramble to understand their seemingly world-shattering situation. The performances are overwrought yet vigorous, some of the most intense I&apos;ve ever seen on screen. They walk the line between scary and silly, ultimately emerging as rather uncanny. As such, they&apos;re rather unsettling. They&apos;re over-the-top without being obnoxious, forceful without being foolish, pretty much pitch-perfect for what the movie tries to achieve. Everything is just a bit off, representative of a kind of unreality that roots the story in a world adjacent to our own, recognisable yet alien. The tone is effectively bizarre, as is the film in general. There&apos;s nothing quite like it, to be honest. It certainly has a distinct effect. The actual plot is strangely discreet considering how brazenly unsubtle the overall experience is. The movie is, at its core, a metaphor for divorce. The specifics of how this metaphor relates to the beat-for-beat plot are almost irrelevant. In a way, the film&apos;s subtext is its substance. Without its allegorical underpinning, I suppose it doesn&apos;t really hold any weight. This is almost the opposite of how most movies with an allegorical element operate, as they tend to present an air-tight straightforward story that can also be interpreted in a few different ways. Here, those interpretations are pretty much the only thing that matter. Most of the movie is a literal manifestation of the metaphors it represents; there&apos;s almost no other way to interpret its events. Perhaps that could be frustrating to some, especially because its in-the-moment narrative is purposefully difficult to parse. Yet, it&apos;s a picture that you&apos;re meant to feel more than understand. It makes sure that you feel every visceral moment. In that sense, it&apos;s a total success. It&apos;s oddly engrossing, an energetic and bracing experience that takes no prisoners. It&apos;s bizarrely entertaining in its own way. It&apos;s unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen and all the better for it. 7/10.",

These spectacles tended to take a genre-hybrid approach by blending kung fu, fantasy, horror and comedy into manic cocktails. Martial arts was no longer a question of superhuman, but of occult prowess.\n\nLu Chun-Ku directed two movies in 1983 with a feverish disregard for subtlety. Bastard Swordsman commences true to its title as a coked-up swordplay film but is soon sliding down the slopes of sheer madness. The plot turns into a whirlpool of deception and cartoonish combat. A central element is the Silkworm Style of kung fu. Sounds tame? That&apos;s only until it&apos;s made clear such a practice enables one not only to become practically weightless but also to shoot EXPLODING LASER BEAMS by harvesting inner powers.\n\nThe studio sets, including ancient temple grounds and nocturnal gardens with science fiction lighting, are just beautiful to look at. Everything from the garish costumes to the gleaming weapons ooze lavish charm into the fabric of Bastard Swordsman. This is a movie you simply can&apos;t help having a blast watching in its excessive glory.",

      "reviewBody": "`The Missing&apos; is as close to a feminist movie as can be telling a story that engrosses on the traditional level of the Western without offending warring cultural factions.  Cate Blanchette plays a frontier single mom and local healer, whose teenage daughter is abducted by Apaches and army deserters to sell for prostitution in Mexico.\n\nShe must find her daughter and also deal with her estranged father, played by Tommy Lee Jones, who deserted his family 20 years ago to live with the Apaches and now tracks them with Blanchette to find his granddaughter.\n\n Blanchette is not John Wayne, who played one of the `Searchers&apos; in John Ford&apos;s memorable Western, certainly a source for this story. She lacks Wayne&apos;s easy bigotry about Indians, yet she carries toughness in adversity every bit as strong as Wayne at his most macho.\n\nNor is she Audrey Hepburn in John Huston&apos;s `The Unforgiven,&apos; who is mostly protected from abduction-minded Kiawas by Burt Lancaster.  No, Blanchette carves out a memorable stand-alone heroine in another sterling performance, certainly one of the top 2 actresses in film today.\n\nCinematographer Salvatore Totino uses aerial shots to capture the vast but imprisoning New Mexico landscape; James Horner&apos;s swelling music now and then feels as if it can&apos;t wait for another `Titanic&apos;; Ron Howard&apos;s direction is unobtrusive, in the same way he allowed Russell Crowe to save Howard&apos;s middling `Beautiful Mind&apos; screenplay. Actually Howard prepared himself by directing the Mel Gibson `Ransom,&apos; also about abduction and pursuit.\n\nThe realism starts in the first scene with Blanchette extracting a tooth from an almost toothless hag and proceeds with multiple bloody encounters, too many for me in a long movie that could have edited out several encounters. But seeing Blanchette and Jenna Boyd as her younger daughter act with apparent full chops is to be happy that we no longer have to rely on Wayne for rugged individualism. As Gloria Steinem reminds us, `When both sexes realize that either one can be on top, we&apos;re all going to enjoy our relationships a lot more.&apos;"

      "reviewBody": "Yet another excellent film by Japanese director Shôhei Imamura! I&apos;m amazed by how much great work he made!\n\n&apos;Intentions of Murder&apos; revolves around Sadako, a plump woman with a peasant background who is abused by her loveless husband and in-laws and is raped by a degenerate thief. Her life is so full of bitterness and suffering, that she constantly contemplates committing suicide. Unbearably heavy as that may sound, the film is very artfully carried by Imamura&apos;s skill, inventiveness and great wisdom. The director never makes fun of Sadako&apos;s tragedy – on the contrary, he shows the deepest sympathy for her (much like he does for the female lead in his previous film, &apos;The Insect Woman&apos;) – but he handles the film&apos;s material with a relatively light touch by making use of a playful soundtrack and by highlighting the absurdity of its situations in a way that sometimes verges on black comedy. This is the story of an underdog who, while devoid of any wit, much wealth or classic good looks, is possessed with the strongest mettle and tenacity. \n\nA recurring theme in his work (and particularly in my favorite film of his, &apos;Profound Desire of the Gods&apos;) is the clash between the structured mores of society and our unruly human desires and emotions. Inconvenient as it may be, our animal nature doesn&apos;t always accept the order that we try to impose on it rationally. This contradiction between different impulses can cause confusion, embarrassment, distress, violence... And yet, to some extent we&apos;re left with no choice but to somehow come to terms with that wild, anarchic aspect of our humanity.\n\nI think it&apos;s fair to say that beyond our survival and animal instincts, the director points to love (both self-love and love for those around us) as the best compass in life. In this case, Sadako&apos;s love for her son serves her as a guiding light, even when it all seems hopeless. Imamura, despite populating many of his films with despicable, selfish characters, in the end seems to show some faith in human kind. It&apos;s a welcome spark of optimism in what would otherwise be a very darkly cynical perspective.\n\nIn an interview provided as an extra-feature by the Criterion Collection, Imamura explains that he needed to loosen up after having finished his 1960 film, &apos;My Second Brother&apos;, which won international acclaim but was too strait-laced for his taste. His style began to change after that, and I believe it&apos;s with &apos;Intentions of Murders&apos; that the director began to play with surrealism, something that would become more prominent in later films like &apos;The Pornographers&apos; and &apos;Warm Water Under The Red Bridge&apos;.\n\nIt&apos;s true that a few of the metaphors in this film are a little too obvious (particularly the hamster in the cage). But there&apos;s so much more going on here, including beautiful black and white photography, a powerful story in general and really solid acting. This is a film that I highly recommend watching.",

      "reviewBody": "As a child I was already an avid reader, and nothing fascinated me more than Goethe. I knew many of his poems and some of his plays by heart and up to today, I find comfort in rereading his work and nearly three hundred years later everything he wrote has still relevance. Since many years I have three heroes and all three of them have a name starting with G: Goethe, Gandhi and Gaudi. so I never miss a book or a movie telling their stories, but sometimes I miss the movies in the theater, as they are not main stream. That was the case with the Goethe movie and I happened to find it in my local library. My first reaction to the movie was not so positive. I felt like these film makers were turning the German geniuses into some kind of crazy persons, I especially felt that way with Amadeus and also Beethoven.. And the first scenes of this movie worried me that they were trying to do the same thing to Goethe. There is this entry monologue in Faust when he talks about having studied so much and learned nothing.&quot; Ah! Now I&apos;ve done Philosophy, I&apos;ve finished Law and Medicine, And sadly even Theology: Taken fierce pains, from end to end. Now here I am, a fool for sure! No wiser than I was before:&quot;\n\nI always saw Goethe as Faust, a well=educated but disillusioned man seeking for the meaning of life, not a desperate love-sick youngster.. But when the movie continued I started to like it . Eighteenth century Germany is captured quite convincingly, the costumes, the sets and the landscape are beautiful and the acting persuasive. It transported me into a fantasy trying to imagine how Goethe lived as a young man. I had visited his house in Weimar after the wall fell and some of the places in Italy he favored, which helped me to understand him better.. I deeply resent the English translation of the movie title, this movie has nothing in common with Shakespeare in love and is much more realistic. I will certainly buy the DVD to add to my collection of favorite movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Its 1873; New Mexico Territory; an  Outlaw and a Cattle Rancher must put aside their differences to stop Alien invaders hellbent on experimenting on humans and stripping the land of its gold.\n\nThere&apos;s something kooky about the title Cowboys and Aliens, B-movie-ish, yet, exciting, enticing and genius. However, even with the star talents including Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, with the striking Olivia Wilde and excellent Sam Rockwell Cowboys and Aliens still falls short of expectations. The script is bland, every effort has gone into developing the two main leads but at a cost of the rest of the characters, the basic story and plot.  \n\nThe special and practical effects are well integrated and executed but while fantastic they are nothing that hasn&apos;t been seen before, reminiscent of District 9, Independence Day to name a few. Considering director&apos;s Jon Favreau fun and exciting Iron-man outings this offering is less satisfying. It&apos;s not the mishmash of classic genres that&apos;s the problem, it&apos;s the lazy, predicable story telling. \n\nThe films opening is strong and intriguing, building up to the tension of Ford&apos;s character Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde meeting with Craig&apos;s Jake; its Jones meets Bond, perfect. Both are excellent giving weight to the proceedings. Horses are flipped, guns and gauntlets go wild, aliens leap and stomp on cowboys. But after the first few alien attacks the film wavers onto familiar territory. Although it has a fabulous cast beneath its hat and sweeping, breathtaking Western landscapes under it&apos;s belt - it buckles under it&apos;s own weight. \n\nEven with its somewhat serious tone it&apos;s not brave enough to explore or commit to its own themes leaving it underdeveloped. But it also omits much needed fun leaving the whole film unseasoned and as empty as the plains of Arizona. Debatably, flop Wild Wild West (1999) infused the sci-fi and Western genre more successfully. \n\nCowboys and Aliens is entertaining, it looks good, has a superb cast but it&apos;s painfully predictable and just not that great."

Completists will be forced to sit through an unrewarding short feature, and unless they&apos;ve drunk a gallon of the Wood Kool-Aid they&apos;ll be forced to admit it&apos;s utterly worthless.\n\nPompous narration consisting of pseudo-psychology and shots of nature add nothing to a semi-improvised grinder, with attractive porn pin-up Annette Friedland and her husband spicing up their marriage with the then-novel &quot;swinging&quot;. \n\nSeries of sex scenes don&apos;t fit well together, opening with a boring night club striptease. Film proper begins with hubby Ben picking up a hitchhiker, then humping her on a blanket. Crude sound recording is no fun, as narrator tells us about the psychological ramifications of what we&apos;re watching.\n\nBack home Friedland acts the shrew, but her sensuous blow job is effective, especially since the actress is more frequently associated with soft-core assignments. Hubby works in a Bank of America office bldg., where he shows his pal Jim photos he&apos;s taken of wifey. There&apos;s a lame &quot;kinky&quot; scene where Friedland insists on being dominant with hubby her slave, yet she has him whip her with a belt -all adding up to nothing.\n\nPicture climaxes with a 6-person orgy at Jim&apos;s house, staged like umpteen &quot;swapping&quot; scenes that were standard in porn of the early &apos;70s. Alice plays hard to get at first but the clumsiness of the improvised dialog make this extremely tedious. Two buxom actresses are added to the mix: a bleached blonde and a busty brunette, latter a familiar porn face - perhaps Mycle Brandy. Light jazz score is uninteresting, and the junker just ends with money shots.\n\nWithout the supposed Ed Wood connection, this loser would have remained on the junk heap."

      "name": "Hitchcock remakes Murder! (1930)...in German",
      "reviewBody": "A woman is found murdered with another woman, Mary Baring, with whom she&apos;d been heard to be arguing, present, in a daze. It seems like an open-and-shut case and Baring is put on trial for murder. During deliberations, 11 of the 12 members think she&apos;s guilty. The sceptical one is Sir John Menier who thinks there are holes in the case. However, he is talked round and Baring is found guilty. After the case Menier still has his doubts and wishes he&apos;d been more forceful in arguing against a guilty verdict. He starts to do his own investigating.\n\nIn 1930 Alfred Hitchcock released Murder!, an intriguing murder-thriller. While Murder! Was being shot, Hitchcock was simultaneously making Mary, a German-language version of it, using the same sets but German actors. Mary is almost frame-for-frame and word-for-word (once translated!) the same as Murder! Though manages to run 19 minutes shorter. German must be a more succinct language than English...\n\nThe end result is almost as good as Murder! An original start, introducing much of the circumstances around the murder via a murder trial and introducing the main character, Menier, through the jury&apos;s deliberations.\n\nThe plot developments are good and the climax is quite Shakespearean, which is appropriate considering that the setting is the theatre and most of the characters are theatre actors and crew.\n\nI watched the two films less than day apart and Murder! Was fresh in my mind when I watched Mary. Production values seem a bit lower on Mary and Hitchcock makes less use of clever camera angles in Mary. On the plus side, the irritating smash cuts in Murder! Are not there in Mary. Being longer, Murder! Seems more tension-filled too.\n\nThe subtitling on the version of Mary I watched was quite shonky, which also detracted from the film.\n\nNow for the big question: why did Hitchcock make a German version of Murder!? I guess that sound in movies was so new and primitive that simply dubbing Murder! Into German wasn&apos;t an option. In the silent era a movie could easily be adapted into another language - just change the dialogue cards!\n\nBut why bother at all? My guess is that Germany was a large cinematic market and/or Hitchcock had a large fan base in Germany, hence a film specifically for that market. It&apos;s like (30 years later) the Beatles re-recording and releasing many of their early stuff in German.\n\nIt&apos;s worth noting that this was the one and only time Hitchcock made a foreign-language version of one of his movies. Either Mary wasn&apos;t as good an idea as he imagined or technology improved and soon after this his films were dubbed or sub-titled for foreign audiences.",

      "reviewBody": "I seem to be the first in the US to comment on this film after having seen it at a regular theater.\n\nThere&apos;s no sense in talking about the movie&apos;s plot as so many others have already done so.\n\nMy fiancée is German and tends to be interested in those artsy foreign films. Tonight she decided we should go see this one. I&apos;m glad we did.\n\nI&apos;ve seen a number of Paul Verhoeven&apos;s films and have found some of them quite entertaining, if a bit tacky and unrealistic. I wasn&apos;t expecting much from a Dutch film by a guy known for making big budget, tacky films.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by this film.\n\nYes, it most certainly IS a Paul Verhoeven film. Gratuitous nudity and violence seem to be his hallmarks and they&apos;re certainly not lacking. Do they detract from the movie? A little, but not enough to lose sight of the message of the film - or to make it any less enjoyable.\n\nWe had recently seen &quot;The Lives of Others&quot; which starred Sebastian Koch. It made his character oddly familiar. I&apos;m certainly a fan of his after seeing his performance in both of these movies.\n\nAs for Carice van Houten... well, one of the marks of a true STAR is that you just can&apos;t take your eyes off of him or her. It isn&apos;t just beauty; there are plenty of beautiful women in the world who don&apos;t possess that same star quality. It isn&apos;t just talent, either; there are many very talented actresses out there who just don&apos;t draw you in in the same way. Carice van Houten has it all: she&apos;s beautiful in a very real way and an amazing talent - and has that something special that makes you look at her every second she&apos;s on screen. I hope the directors of the world take note of her because she deserves the stardom she has exhibited in this film.\n\nIt is good to see a film that depicts how the hunted can easily turn into the hunter. My fiancée&apos;s mother was a young girl during WWII who&apos;s family lived in Poland (near Gdansk aka Danzig). Towards the end of the war, they were forced to leave their home in fear for their lives - both from the advancing Russians and the local Poles exacting revenge for what other Germans had done. The film said it in a slightly different sentence, but it is right in bringing across the message that people seem to never learn: that it is NEVER right to hurt others no matter what they might have done in the past.\n\nI wonder if Paul Verhoeven&apos;s family is Jewish because he really seems to identify with the never ending succession of attacks against the Jewish people. It saddens me that only ONE other review even mentioned the scene at the end where Rachel&apos;s community (in Israel) was being attacked. Part of the film&apos;s message is that we seemed doomed to repeat our inhumanity to our fellow man.\n\nWas this a perfect movie? Certainly not. Is it a masterpiece ala &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; or &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; or &quot;Saving Private Ryan?&quot; Probably not. But I&apos;ll say that in the several hours since I&apos;ve seen it, I can&apos;t stop thinking about it. And I certainly enjoyed every minute of that 2-1/2 hour film while watching it. I&apos;d watch it again if I had it on DVD.",

Maybe it&apos;s real hard core action guys who dislike it, and it&apos;s probably not for them - but really this came as a very pleasant surprise. Highly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "Ben Jonson famously described William Shakespeare as &apos;not for an age but for all time&apos; and &apos;Hamlet&apos; with its themes of usurped power and revenge would seem ideally suited to the modern, corporate era.\n\nAki Kaurismaki&apos;s customarily deadpan treatment entitled &apos;Hamlet goes Business&apos; is not everyone&apos;s cup of tea whilst Akira Kurosawa&apos;s powerful and underrated &apos;The Bad Sleep Well&apos; is not nearly as derivative of Shakespeare as his &apos;Throne of Blood&apos; and &apos;Ran&apos;. Chabrol&apos;s darkly humorous &apos;Ophélia&apos; certainly has its moments but it is probably wiser to draw a discreet veil over Michael Almereyda&apos;s &apos;Hamlet 2000&apos; in which Elizabethan verse is totally unsuited to urban America. That leaves the version by one of Germany&apos;s finest directors Helmut Kautner, its title taken from Hamlet&apos;s dying words.\n\nThis film makes fascinating viewing for those who know the play and this viewer at any rate is impressed as to how well the characters have been adapted to a post WW11 industrial setting. Kautner&apos;s directorial style is restrained and as always he gets the best from his players. Especially well handled is the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and extremely inventive is the portrayal of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern as a gay couple who put on a ballet that fulfils the function of Shakespeare&apos;s &apos;play within a play&apos; and recreates the murder of Hamlet&apos;s father, much to the discomfort of the murderer, a perfectly cast Peter van Eyck. Special mention must be made of veteran Rudolph Forster, the definitive Mackie Messer, whose performance here as Polonius is beautifully understated. It must be said that following his character&apos;s death the film loses momentum somewhat and becomes less of Shakespeare and more of Agatha Christie, especially as the police inspector is played by Charles Régnier, a familiar face in Krimifilms of the period.\n\nUnsurprisingly the spectre of Hitler haunts the proceedings and a critic of the time remarked that with this film Kautner was coming to terms with the past. He had in fact successfully navigated the perilous waters of National Socialism, gifting us one of the most beautiful films of that era, &apos;Romanze in Moll&apos; and continued to illumine the wasteland of 1950&apos;s German cinema with such films as &apos;The Devil&apos;s General&apos; and &apos;The Last Bridge&apos;. Although &apos;The Rest is Silence&apos; may not be up to their standard, it bears the hallmarks of a director of intelligence, sensitivity and humanity.",

      "reviewBody": "The films focus on translating the novels first person perspective is clearly an obsession for this director. Never is the audiences attention allowed outside of Joe&apos;s point of view. We see only what he sees, we hear nothing more and we remember his life in little snatches, moments of dark disgusting and secret clarity he keeps from the world.\n\nThe film starts with a corpse, a barely dressed woman floating in the Clyde that is fished out by Joe; a young man working the barges for reasons that are not immediately clear. This brutal beginning in which we see Joe lay a tender hand on the cold dead flesh of the girl begins the film with a level of tension that rarely leaves the screen. Through his actions and - more importantly - his inactions we peel away the outer layers of a man on the run from himself, from responsibility and from guilt. We see him commit two murders by mission of inaction and we see him quietly dealing with that in one last lingering shot that tells us he will never change.\n\nJoe is sexually driven to destroy life around him and he uses sex as a weapon against himself and against the possibility of settling or creating a future. He could be a writer, but he lacks the courage to read his own work. He could be a father, but he cannot face the thought of commitment. He could be a lover, but he makes love to women only as a means to an end, rejecting and pushing them away once the act is completed.\n\nAnd this is the film in a nutshell. A relentless character study of an unpleasant man who punishes those around him for his own failings. Yes there is gratuitous sex in this film, but it has its place, it defines the moments of change in everyone else&apos;s lives while underlining the static character of Joe, played with utter brilliance by Ewen McGregor. The sex is cold, rather than erotic, reflecting the characters contempt for those he uses. Without the detailed sex scenes the film would be less than it is, but audiences expected to be titillated will come away disappointed.\n\nNot without flaws this film has that perplexing title and a scene in which Joe beats his girlfriend after covering her with custard. The scene is alien to both the film and the character of Joe who gives no indication of being violent, rather a man that will walk out on a problem rather than face the awful possibility of confrontation. In fact Ewen McGregor seems embarrassed to play this scene, as though he too cannot link this outburst to the character he is playing.\n\nBut this minor quibble apart the film remains an artistically shot work, played with brilliance by everyone. Its rare to see a film where the whole cast are brilliant, where the script is clearly cut and the direction thought through. The visual aspect of the film is also tremendous with each shot being laid out in front of us like a painting, a wondrous work of art that moves and flows to show us the 60&apos;s post war Brittan with utter clarity.\n\nHollywood please take note."

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes-though not often-you find an aristocrat who behaves improperly and in a bizarre way not in keeping their privileged condition. It would seem that strange conduct among aristocrats is not uncommon in Denmark as some English playwright wrote some centuries back. Such odd behaviour can also be found in the film &quot;Der Var Engang&quot; (Once Upon A Time) directed by Herr Carl Theodor Dreyer in the silent year of 1922.\n\nThe film depicts the case of the Prince of Denmark who travels to the land of Illyria where lives a princess who knows pretty well her exalted role and acts accordingly, a capricious and spoiled royal who rejects one by one all her suitors and certainly the Prince of Denmark wouldn&apos;t be an exception for her.\n\nAnnoyed by this and smitten with the royal brat, the Prince of Denmark decides to teach her a lesson with the help of his assistant, called &quot;Smokehat&quot;. The Prince will disguise himself as a commoner in his plan to win the princess&apos; heart.\n\n&quot;Der Var Engang&quot; was an adaptation of a play by Herr Holger Drachmann that was very popular in Denmark and the film captures the fairytale atmosphere, especially during the first half of the picture in which there is much subtle humour that makes good use of Danish folklore and is supported by astonishing art direction and beautiful bucolic scenery. \n\nIn the second half of the film things take a new turn with the luxurious fairytale setting and the easy life at the palace disappearing as the Princess learns of real life and must endure the perils and hardships of commoners. Far from the safety of the palace, she learns humility, forgets her pride and finally falls in love.\n\nAlthough almost half of the film is lost, the surviving footage is well supported by still photos to make up a complete narrative, a great restoration by the Danish Film Institute giving the opportunity to silent film fans around the world to see a very different type of Herr Dreyer work in which a fairy tale is combined with a serious moral, the latter being more characteristic of the Dreyer films that were to come.\n\nAnd now, if you&apos;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must continue to behave as a true Teutonic aristocrat.\n\nHerr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com",

      "reviewBody": "I watched Forever the Moment on the plane en route to Corea and I have to say it was a good way to pass the long hours. This is a Corean sports movie. Not only a sports movie, but a handball movie. And not only a handball movie, but a women&apos;s handball movie. That&apos;s right. A women&apos;s team goes for the Olympic glory in handball at the Athens 2004 Olympics--the story is their rise to their moment in the spotlight.\n\nBased on the story of the actual team that went to Athens in 2004, the story focuses specifically on the lives of four older (at least as far as athletes go) women who, by virtue of their prowess and past experience in Olympics settings, are recruited into this year&apos;s team and their struggles. Each has a different story and the film takes a few minor twists as it goes forward, which wouldn&apos;t be a surprise to those who know the story of the team.\n\nThe overall story itself is very much like many sports movies, although Forever the Moment seems to take a lot more interest in the personal lives of the four protagonists than their struggles with their various games. Nonetheless, the expected losing, followed by successive wins sequence still makes an appearance here. I think the strength of the film lies in that it takes time to tell the stories of the four older women in the squad, while not entirely neglecting secondary characters and tells the stories with sympathy. When the story came to a close, I felt myself caught up in the emotions of the characters, not because of the win or the loss, but what the win or loss meant to the characters and their personal stories.\n\nThe direction decidedly goes for the straightforward story and does a great job highlighting the various actors. Peppered into the script are moments of comedy as well as some expected melodrama (even as this is based on a true story). One of the support characters, however, undergoes a change that happens too quickly and without enough merit, I think, but overall, I think the story is well constructed and believable.\n\nI was surprised that I enjoyed a movie about a sport that I didn&apos;t know existed. Forever the Moment isn&apos;t a mindblowing experience, but as sports movies go, this is a solid contender. Enjoyable. 8/10.",

Nevertheless, &quot;Wyat Earp&quot; is a laudable effort and well worth the time to sit through its three hours and fifteen minutes running time.\n\nThe performances were uniformly good, with a skeletal Dennis Quade particularly fine as the doomed Doc Holliday. In fact, I thought that Quade&apos;s funny and moving performance as Doc Holliday was in the same class as Val Kilmer&apos;s portrayal of the same character in &quot;Tombstone.&quot; The women playing the Earp wives, Catherine O&apos;Hara, JoBeth Williams, Mare Winningham, and Betty Buckley, were also very effective. The beautiful Joanna Going was a pleasure to watch as Josie Marcus, the woman who Wyat Earp spent the last 47 years of his life with. Unfortunately, her acting skills did not match her beauty.\n\nThe thing that makes the film rise above the mediocre to me is its stunning visual and aural beauty. Its 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is world class, and its outdoor photography is evocative.\n\nRecommended, 7 out of 10.",

This, however, is not reflected in the plot&apos;s structure, its pacing, and the performances of the characters; combined, these aspects fail to build up tension and to help the viewer draw conclusions from the jumbled narrative.\n\nOverall 5/10 Full review on movie-discourse.blogspot.de",

To be sure, it has a few nice martial arts sequences, and the production values are pretty good - in fact, some of the special effects are up to those in big-budget Hollywood movies. Unfortunately, the movie has some of the negative attributes commonly found in big-budget Hollywood movies - a story sorely lacking in explanation, annoying characters, blatant product plugs, and unfunny comic relief. But the main problem is that the story is slow-moving and downright dull at times. If you want to see a more entertaining French actioner, rent WASABI."

This film should have been at the top of their list.\n\nThe Pearl Harbor attack is the climax of the film as well as of the various intricate human relationships in the film. This is a classic piece of romantic history, and the beach scene is probably one of the most erotic ever done -- all the more impressive because it has no nudity.\n\nThis is a real saga of human passion and how it is affected by history. Whether you see PEARL HARBOR or not is up to you. But definitely see this film."

Acting was great and music is simply unforgettable. Tiny pieces of mysteries were placed throughout the movie, but everything comes together perfectly in the end. The story development of this movie has become the ultimate Junai formula, and has been copied many times since, but none of them could match this original movie. I remember almost every single line of this movie by now, but watching it inevitably left a smile on my face in many scenes, and brought tears to my eyes near the end.\n\nPerfect casting, music, story, directing. This movie will remain my favorite film for many years to come.",

None of the cops believe her but they still have to investigate because of her wealth and power. Some suggests that she should go back to the sanitarium. She drags Harry out to search for the UFO. The giant takes her while Harry gets away. He tries to run away with Honey but the sheriff is suspicious of the missing Nancy Archer. They find her and put her away into the sanitarium. There she grows to be a giant 50 foot woman.\n\nThis is more notable for the poster art and the amazingly cheesy title. There isn&apos;t anything quite like it. Others come close like &apos;Snakes on a Plane&apos; or &apos;Sharknado&apos; or &apos;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes&apos;, but this one has the best title of them all. As a movie, this is strictly B-movie horror material. The special effects are almost laughable from the terribly fake giant hands to the badly done optical effects of the giants. The acting is kind of interesting. These actors are trying so hard and taking it so seriously. Sometime they overact, but they never let the silliness of it all take over. It&apos;s safe to say that this is a classic bad movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Who would of thought that a low budget Italian/U.S. war drama with no big stars would be one of the best films of 1968? Certainly not me. I saw &quot;Commandos&quot; on the budget video shelf in a closeout store. The price was right ($.99) and it said &quot;Letterboxed Edition&quot; on it. So I figured, it&apos;s less than the price of a rental, so why not?\n\nWhat surprised me is what an exciting and thoughtful film this was. In an era of glamourized war films (The syrupy &quot;McConnell Story&quot; and ludricous &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; come to mind), a gritty film like &quot;Commandos&quot; is a real pleasure indeed.\n\nIt stars Lee Van Cleef, who you may remember from &quot;A Few Dollars More&quot; and &quot;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.&quot; He was sort of the Harvey Keitel of that time, an actor who took risks and made unconventional films for the time. This is one of his very best performances. How many actors other than Lee Marvin would take such a risky role? He is heroic, but not by choice.\n\nThe plot is not really important. It&apos;s your standard search and decease mission film that&apos;s been used many times before and after. What makes &quot;Commandos&quot; special is its&apos; focus on two things: mind boggling action sequences and characterizations.\n\nI would like to make everyone aware that for a budget video copy, the video transfer is excellent. The colors are vibrant, the sound is exceptional and the full CinemaScope image (2.35:1)is very revealing in its&apos; compositions. Front Row Entertainment has made this one in a series of films that include &quot;Zulu&quot;, the two Chinese made Bruce Lee films &quot;Fists of Fury&quot; and &quot;The Chinese Connection&quot; and the Jackie Chan epic &quot;Drunken Master&quot; (&quot;Legend of Drunken Master&quot; is the sequel)that get the full letterbox treatment. Congratulations are in order and I hope I see more in the series.\n\n&quot;Commandos&quot; is one of those films that either grab you or they don&apos;t. It grabbed me. It was not destined to receive any Oscar nods, but since when does Hollywood ever honor a truly deserving film. Look at this year&apos;s winner, &quot;Gladiator&quot;. I rest my case.\n\n**** out of 4 stars"

Under the direction of Irving Cummings, we get to know a great deal, not only about the invention itself, but a little bit about the man.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell was an ambitious man who was interested in helping a young deaf-mute boy, as the picture opens. We see him toiling at a prototype for the telegraph, and stumbling into the transmission of sound through wires, thus creating something that revolutionized society, business and the world at large. In retrospect, one can only imagine how could anyone survived without it! Thanks to Mr. Bell, his invention is something that benefited all of us.\n\nDon Ameche makes an intense Alexander Graham Bell. He was a charming actor who never ceased to amaze us in all the movies he left behind. Loretta Young, makes a wonderful Mabel Hubbard, Mr. Bell&apos;s beloved wife who had to struggle with her own deafness. A young Henry Fonda is seen as Bell&apos;s loyal friend Thomas Watson.\n\nThe cast assembled for the film shows the best Hollywood could offer. Charles Coburn and Spring Byinton play the kind Hubbards. Gene Lockhart is also quite good as Thomas Sanders. Two of Loretta Young sisters Polly Ann and Georgiana play two of the Hubbard girls, as well as Sally Blane who is the fourth daughter.\n\nThis is a film that is instructive as well as fun to watch because of the subject matter and the cast that made the story come alive.",

      "reviewBody": "Santo contra el cerebro diabólico is actually one of the more exciting films among the earlier efforts in the series. Many of the Santo films from the early 60s are overly talky and, sometimes, have very little to do with El Santo at all, such as El Hotel del Muerte wherein the Man in the Silver Mask doesn&apos;t even show up until an hour into the picture! This one does not suffer from either of those problems too terribly and it is pretty suspenseful with loads of intrigue and great fight scenes. However, it ends up a totally different story than it starts out as. In the beginning our intrepid police detectives arrest a mysterious criminal who is never named and never speaks, but who is apparently a subordinate of a criminal mastermind they hope to catch. After that, Fernando discovers that Virginia (the Lois Lane of El Santo movies) has gone to an isolated village to do a story and disappeared. The detectives go after her and find a small community lorded over by a rich and evil man in a pretty typical Western genre plotting device. The first part is never mentioned again, and at no point is anyone resembling a &quot;cerebro diabólico&quot; (diabolical brain) ever seen. I have to assume that for one reason or another they abandoned the original story for what they ended up with, but the result is a pointless and confusing prologue and a title that doesn&apos;t make any sense at all. But in the end, who cares? It&apos;s El Santo, not a Merchant-Ivory production. Enjoy it for what it is!",

Meaning, if they died and came back they&apos;d still be in prison. LOL!\n\nHarry Monroe (Richard Pryor) and Skip Donahue (Gene Wilder) are two friends who&apos;ve been fired from their respective small-time jobs in New York. Skip is a playwright and Harry is an actor. They decided that their firings were signs, so they packed up and headed west to make their big break. Their big break came in Arizona-as in their van breaking down. Then, through some criminal deceit and judicial ineptness the two of them end up in prison with 125 year sentences.\n\nThis movie, as far as comedy, was better than Silver Streak. Pryor and Wilder both were in fine form. Not only that, prison just seems to make for such funny scenarios. I thoroughly enjoyed Stir Crazy.",

It&apos;s a very self-conscious homage to both &quot;The Wild One&quot;, with Willem Dafoe in the Brando role, (it also marked Dafoe&apos;s &apos;official&apos; debut), and Kenneth Anger&apos;s &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; shot in the garish colors of the kind of fifties&apos; melodramas that Douglas Sirk might have made. It&apos;s got a very rough and ready feel to it and the script and the acting leave a lot to be desired but it looks great, (Bigelow was a painter before going into movies), and it has a great soundtrack. Hardly anything happens and it might have worked better as a short but at 82 minutes it never outstays its welcome and is worth catching.",

If you&apos;re a Kung Fu fan and haven&apos;t seen this, I can only say it&apos;s what you&apos;ve been waiting for. I must warn you, a lot of other Kung Fu movies will seem mediocre afterwards. Apart from Sammo&apos;s genius, there is the mighty Leung Kar Yan (&quot;Beardy&quot;) as the grey haired doctor - he cannot fail to amaze! I can think of a few movies that come close (Prodigal Son, The Victim..) but this is the cream."

      "reviewBody": "While I enjoyed Poliwood and everything it taught me about some of the actual views of celebrities, I couldn&apos;t help but feel that I was being manipulated. Everyone of the liberal celebrities is shown to be open-minded, intelligent, kind, compassionate, and empathetic. Meanwhile all of the Republicans--in one way or another--are subtly discredited. Example: The interview of Stephen Baldwin centers on religion and not politics. The entire film seemed to be about how rough the celebrities have it with their opinions not being respected. \n\nThere was a clear bias in that there was rarely any mentioning of liberal media bias. The only media bias widely spoken of was, of course, Fox News. For crying out loud, Keith Olbermann, who many times out-Foxes Fox, is used to prove one of Levinson&apos;s points about conservatives. \n\nLevinson&apos;s bias is finally and ultimately revealed when he arrives at the RNC. Upon arrival, he immediately begins to crack jokes (Which might have been funny if he didn&apos;t have his sidekick ruining them). This is in stark contrast to his reverential approach to the DNC and President Obama. (Of course once the holy liberal celebrities arrive, they begin to hold meetings with conservatives about open-mindedness.)\n\nFinal Verdict: 6/10 It was extremely interesting to me, however; it is a very manipulative, biased piece of film.",

      "reviewBody": "Although the plot is confusing at times, a second viewing helps to untangle the convoluted story about dreams and reality.  Most of the time we are not sure if what we are watching is really happening or whether it is a profoundly disturbing nightmare.  Cesar (Edouardo Noriega) whose head is badly fractured in a high speed car crash quite understandably has blurred recollections of events involving his good buddy Pelayo and his girl friends Sofia and Nuria.  As his doctor explains: In dreams characters are often substituted, one for the other.\n\nThere is much I like about this film. First of all I like the script.  The dialogue between Sofia and Cesar at first meeting and afterwards is so natural, so believable.  The four main characters are absolutely charming and have a rapport between each other that is rarely seen in films. This is either good casting or good acting, or maybe a bit of both.  As the story unfolds we are completely absorbed.  This is true entertainment on the highest level.  O.K. we may not be fully cognisant of what is happening at times, but we glue ourselves to the screen expecting that an explanation will come in due course.\n\nThere are some chilling lines e.g. Just before Nuria steps on the accelerator: &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot;\n\nThere are some mysterious questions put to Cesar e.g. &quot;Who is Eli? You called out &apos;Eli...Eli&apos; while you were dreaming. Is she a girl?&quot; No such person. What then? The mystery deepens.\n\nThere is quality photography in the film.   The rain in the park. And before that the reflections of foliage flashing in the car windows with glimpses of tense faces.\n\nThe make-up team too does a great job On Cesar&apos;s handsome face. What a transformation!\n\nOn top of all this we get a lesson on cryonics and the possibility of immortality. What more do you want for your money?\n\nTake it from me.  This is a film you must see.",

      "name": "Fair adaptation of a complex novel",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;If it can be written, or thought, it can be filmed&quot;, said the great Stanley Kubrick, who adapted most of his films from novels and turned them into his own films, rather than being too literal (or faithful, if you prefer) to the source material (and often turning authors and fans of the adapted novels crazy  Stephen King, anyone?). I agree with his statement. No literary work is &quot;unfilmable&quot;  which doesn&apos;t necessarily mean any literary work, good or bad, can be turned into a good movie. However, in spite of a few flaws, &quot;Blindness&quot; is a very efficient adaptation of a brilliant (and very complex) novel by Portuguese author José Saramago, &quot;Ensaio Sobre a Cegueira&quot; (literally, &quot;Essay About Blindness&quot;), and doesn&apos;t deserve all the bad reviews it&apos;s been getting.\n\nThe negative reaction towards the film doesn&apos;t surprise me at all, though. Fernando Meirelles, after getting world acclaim with his neoclassic &quot;City of God&quot;, made a very successful transition to an international project with the beautiful &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;. His sophomore English project is very daring and dark, uneasy to watch at times, but also compelling and thought-provoking.\n\nCésar Charlone&apos;s exquisite cinematography sets the tone for the story of an unexplained &quot;white blindness&quot; epidemic. It&apos;s also a huge asset to have such a phenomenal actress like Julianne Moore to play the film&apos;s heroine: as always, she has a strong presence and is extremely expressive, making everyone believe and feel for her character&apos;s cross of being the only one who can see in a chaotic quarantine, where people have to submit to violence and rape in order to survive.\n\nMy only major complaint is about the uneven first 20 minutes or so: some sequences seem a little disjointed and the acting somewhat amateurish, but once the first act is done the film finds its own pace and strength. Roger Ebert called it &quot;one of the most unpleasant, not to say unendurable, films&quot; he&apos;s ever seen. For a start, it would be stupid to assume a film with such a dark premise would be uplifting (and if Ebert had the slightest knowledge about the material it&apos;s based on, he&apos;d realize what he was up for), so his comment is unintelligent and atrocious like the majority of everything he&apos;s ever written (but he&apos;s a widely popular Pulitzer-winning film critic, so unfortunately lots of people trust his opinion before going to see a movie). Even though I still prefer the outstanding novel to the film, I admire director Fernando Meirelles and writer Don McKellar&apos;s adaptation for what it is: smart, daring and respectful to its source material, without being overtly faithful or afraid of taking risks. And Saramago himself approved the film, so who are we to criticize? The man knows what he&apos;s talking about; if you want to see it for yourself, read his novel now and then compare it to this film, appreciating it not as a literary work, but as the good piece of cinema it is. 8/10."

I&apos;m a car guy and a Pink Floyd fan, so even though there is some sweet exhaust noise and narration over the sound track, that&apos;s OK, because it is a sound track, not the focus of the film. Reproduction E-Type Jaguars were used and race at high speeds on closed roadways through Mexico. Great camera work with on-board shots and great footage of the local festivities, countryside and repairs along the journey. All of this with the euphoric sounds of Pink Floyd laid over it.\n\nSo, if you are not a fan of sport car racing, and you are looking for a Pink Floyd performance . . . don&apos;t bother looking for a copy. Yes looking. It is not readily available for purchase. Only sold in VHS in the early 90&apos;s, in a limited quantity, even the best known sellers of movies and motorsports don&apos;t offer it. I&apos;ve seen a new VHS copy selling on e-bay for $130 US.\n\nI can only hope that they get together and release it on DVD.",

      "reviewBody": "This remake of the 1973 George Romero film sees the rural Iowa town of Ogden Marsh become unhinged when it&apos;s residents begin exhibiting odd behavior, usually culminating in acts of violence. Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) is at a loss to explain what&apos;s happening to the people he&apos;s known all his life, but the discovery of a dead pilot in a marsh leads him to the answer, a downed plane infecting the town&apos;s water supply. It isn&apos;t long before the military has blocked all methods of communication and descended upon the town. Determined to render a final solution, they don&apos;t intend to let anyone out alive.\n\nFollowing the basic setup of the original, this update expands upon the story and throws in a few new directions and surprises. If you ask me, there was plenty of room for improvement. Romero&apos;s film is decent, but highly flawed. You could blame the budget, but Romero&apos;s done some fantastic work with low budgets. It definitely had bigger problems than that. This is the type of remake I wish there were more of, the type that can improve on a weak original. We spend the majority of the film with the four main characters as they attempt to escape the madness; David, his wife (Radha Mitchell), his deputy (Joe Anderson) and his wife&apos;s secretary (Danielle Pannabaker). I was already a fan of both Olyphant and the lovely Mitchell before viewing this, and they&apos;re once again in solid form here. This is basically Olyphant&apos;s show, and he owns the screen when he&apos;s on. I&apos;d love to see him get more leading roles after this. Anderson and Pannabaker are also impressive, getting me to care about the fates of their characters, something that many horror films have a hard time doing. One of the major differences between this and the Romero original is the lack of focus on the military&apos;s point of view this time around. We spend the duration seeing the events from the perspective of the leads and various other townsfolk. While the POV shown in the &apos;73 film did offer some levels of interest, I think it works better as far as menace goes to not do that here.\n\nThe crazies themselves are well rendered, each person reacting differently to the virus. Some are completely gone while others still retain some semblance of a thought process, the hunters for instance. After seeing the trailer, I was worried that they&apos;d turn this into another zombie movie, but I was happy to see that wasn&apos;t the case. Speaking of the crazies, Lynn Lowry (of the original, Shivers, I Drink Your Blood, etc.) pops up very briefly as one of them. A nice little nod there, and I noticed another potential nod to a similar film, 1984&apos;s Impulse, in which contaminated milk leads people to act on their base impulses. A scene of Olyphant running after a mysterious vehicle that has been documenting the carnage mirrors a sequence from that picture. Also of note is Maxime Alexandre&apos;s gorgeous cinematography. Eisner was smart in getting him, as he&apos;s done equally stellar work for Alexandre Aja in the past. Thankfully, the use of CGI is minimal. In fact, I don&apos;t believe any pops up until the end, and when we get to that, it actually works just fine.\n\nThe film is peppered with a number of suitably tense set-pieces, particularly one involving a pitchfork, a scene in a car wash and the aforementioned ending. On the downside, there are a few cheap jump scares thrown in. The music also struck me as being rather pedestrian at times. Overall though, I can safely say I&apos;ll be returning to this one more often than the 1973 effort."

      "reviewBody": "The storyline, settings and production values of this film are all strangely similar to the notoriously sick horror classic &quot;Last House on Dead End Street&quot;. Could it possibly be that pure grim grindhouse exploitation is back from the dead?!? Well, not really, but the least you can say about &quot;Snuff-Movie&quot; is that it&apos;s a reasonably good attempt to revive the misogynous shock-cinema from the 70&apos;s. Even more surprising is that the film is a one-man project of Bernard Rose, a director whose older films &quot;Candyman&quot; and &quot;Paperhouse&quot; are still regarded as stylish and prominent horror classics. The underrated Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbé stars as the embittered filmmaker Boris Arkadim who lost his beautiful wife and a share of close friends because they were killed by a bunch of violent maniacs who videotaped their crimes. Fourteen years later, Boris decides to make a new movie that tells the story of that night and thus four actors are lured to his isolated mansion full of cameras. It takes quite a while before anyone notices, but Boris plans to slaughter his guests on camera for real. Bernard Rose&apos;s script tries to be a little TOO intelligent (especially near the end) and the tension-level lowers with every plot twist. The gore is incontestably NASTY and there&apos;s plenty of authentic sleaze (there&apos;s a blond Playboy model in the cast, people!), so fans of underground-trash horror will love those moments! Despite the promising title, however, &quot;Snuff-Movie&quot; isn&apos;t half as disturbing, offensive or controversial as it wants to be and the film definitely needed a better climax. The acting performances are more than adequate and the cinematography with a Sony hand-camera is fairly well-handled. Worth a look if you&apos;re into semi-extreme cinema.",

I do not know much about Thai films or films from Singapore, but I can say that this is surprisingly stylish. I mean, am I wrong, or is Thailand a country where you can live comfortably on a dollar a day? \n\nSo far, the film has received generally negative reviews, with people pointing out the obvious blue tint. Yes, the tint is overdone. It seems to be a growing trend in recent years, and I have not found out why. But beyond that, it is not a bad film... maybe nothing special, but not bad.\n\nI would not personally recommend this one to people, but perhaps if someone was really into Thai or Asian films... this definitely has a vibe that Chinese and Japanese films have. Not sure why they have the obsession with ghosts that they do, but here is another example of that motif."

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes one is undecided on whether to watch a film in the cinema and waits for the DVD to come out - only to discover that one has ruined one&apos;s experience for oneself, because the film in question cannot really be appreciated on a small screen. This is very much the case with the German, but almost entirely English-spoken &apos;Same same but different&apos;: it&apos;s the first German film in a long time that makes abundant use of cinematography instead of television aesthetics (not counting Tom Tykwer&apos;s recent international oeuvre). Upon its premiere in Locarno last year, it received an award by Variety for its international potential - well deserved, indeed. But apparently it failed to strike a cord in most viewers nevertheless, probably because the story sounds more depressing than romantic.\n\nWell, it isn&apos;t really: it&apos;s very much a love story. One reason why I initially bypassed it was director Detlev Buck&apos;s previous record of light-weight comedies of limited entertainment value, but here, he somewhat returns to his early-90s beginnings, the films he built his reputation on: &apos;Karniggels&apos; (1990) and &apos;Wir können auch anders&apos; (1993). In these little marvels, Buck managed to convey character depth by small gestures, which made you forget the budget constraints these productions had. With his success, he would later abandon this laconic narrative style in search of big screen liability, which was very unfortunate for his early fans. &apos;Same same but different&apos; reveals Buck as one of the few real professionals German cinema has, because he combines this big production with the simplicity of his auteur days.\n\nThat effort would be in vain if he wouldn&apos;t have the cast to support him, and that&apos;s where this film becomes really interesting to me. Much has been said about the freshness of David Kross, who has been fortunate to land a lead in a big-budget production at very young age (&apos;The Reader&apos;), and therefore manages to bring a genuine sense of guilelessness into his acting. But given that he has been portraying (so far) average characters thrown into extraordinary situations, I believe that his roles cannot be taken for a proof of talent, as he&apos;s just interpreting things in a way most people would. The few moments when &apos;Same same but different&apos; feels awkward arise when his character Ben is forced into individual actions he&apos;s unwilling to take - most of the time, he just allows everything to happen, and it is this passivity that fits Kross more than anything else.\n\nThe real star of the film - and the reason why I seriously regret not having watched this in the cinema - is Apinya Sakuljaroensuk. It was essentially her minimalistic performance in Pen-ek Ratanaruang&apos;s Ploy which made that film one of my favorites of 2008. There&apos;s something absolutely commanding about her from the very first moment she appears on screen, something that forces you to gaze at her as intensely as she does, a beatific, ephemeral shroud of what I would in lack of better terms call beauty from the inside. If the comparison is not too bold: I had an equal sense of awe at an actress only when I watched &apos;Roman Holiday&apos; for the first time. Yes, I&apos;m talking about Audrey Hepburn, believe it or not. I&apos;m rather curious as to what future may hold for this barely 20-year-old, who handles the complexities of her part so well - a young woman balancing love and calculation, dream and reality in precarious, yet purposeful ways.\n\nIn short: a surprisingly deep tale of love against all odds, not as depressing as some of you may think, and lacking only in a supporting cast to make the story as believable as it actually - being based on a true story - is.",

Watch the East German (DEFA) version from 1958 instead - it isn&apos;t ideal, but is generally on a much higher level. (I was interested in film versions since I teach this play to German literature students quite often, and wanted a film to accompany the reading.) I suspect German reviewers and viewers may have thought similarly, since this director has never done anything since. The 1913 version by Friedrich Feher (a significant director) looks intriguing, but do not know if this is available anywhere.",

      "reviewBody": "After a heist of a casino, the criminal Addison (Eric Bana) is on the run to Canada with his accomplice Theo (Dennis Lafond) and his sister Liza (Olivia Wilde). Out of the blue, Theo hits a deer and loses control of the car that leaves the road and overturns. Theo dies and Addison kills a patrolman that comes to help them. Then he splits the money with Liza and tells her to get a ride to the border while he will cross the woods. Addison leaves a trail of blood in his runaway. \n\nMeanwhile, the former boxer Jay (Charlie Hunnam), who was arrested for losing a fight, is released from prison on probation and calls his mother June Mills (Sissy Spacek) that lives in an isolated house with his estranged father Chet Mills (Kris Kristofferson) that was the former Sheriff. June invites her son for the Thanksgiving dinner, but he goes first to the gym to collect money that his couch owes him. They quarrel and Jay hits him and believes that has killed him. He flees and while driving on the road, he sees Liza and gives a ride to her. Soon they fall in love with each other. Meanwhile Sheriff Marshall T. Becker (Treat Williams) is hunting Addison with his men but he does not allow that his daughter, Deputy Hanna (Kate Mara) to participate in the hunting party. The Thanksgiving will end with all the characters gathering at Chet and June&apos;s home. \n\n&quot;Deadfall&quot; is a good thriller with impressive landscape in the snow. The engaging story begins with a poor development of Addison and Liza and does not show the heist of the casino. But the plot is tense and the cast has great names. Sheriff Marshall T. Becker is one of the most imbecile and arrogant sheriffs that I have seen in an American movie. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;A Fuga&quot; (&quot;The Runaway&quot;)",

The quartet seeks for help in an empty farm, but Elliot and Trevor decides to walk further, leaving Brian and Allison waiting for them in the farm. They meet the highway patrol Officer Mitchell (John Speredakos) that brings them back to meet Brian and Allison. Meanwhile Brian decides to go to the barn, where he is attacked by vampire bats. When the group seeks for him in the barn, they are trapped inside by the killer bats that turn people into zombies.\n\n&quot;The Roost&quot; is not a totally bad low-budget movie, actually it is tense and has good acting of the unknown cast. However, it is a short story that is extended in low-pace to last 80 minutes running time, and becomes boring in a certain moment. The conclusion and the silly black and white insertions with The Horror Host are awful. I do not know if the intention of the director / writer Ti West was to extend the feature or try to make it cult with the insertions, but the fact is that it does not work. My vote is four.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Ataque dos Morcegos&quot; (&quot;Bats Attack&quot;)",

I happened to watch this great film in 1992 but still I remember it mainly on account of the very strong script of the movie. Raghu&apos;s father&apos;s face expresses one billion messages . An actor like that would be hardly discovered .Raghu is the only hope of the family and is finally born in the mindset of the father . Rain means the tears of the father. These type of films must be demonstrated in all over the world specially in SriLanka. Devaka S. Jayasuriya 90, Old Kesbawa Road Nugegoda."

Starring Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine, and Tom Hardy this fascinating fusion of espionage, action, and comedy brings to the screen a dating two men dilemma in a thriller format. While competent enough, the attempt to offer the audience big action thrills while at the same time balancing the antics of two men fawning for the same woman diffuses the smart focused energy of each of these major movie genres on screen. Another problem that develops is the rather questionable ethical scheming that occurs and who Witherspoon&apos;s character eventually attaches herself to. Contrast The Hitman&apos;s Bodyguard (2017), The True Memoirs of an International Assassin (2016), Red (2010), Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005), The Matador (2005) or even The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) where these espionage comedies incorporate relational themes as a secondary, accompanying screen time experiences. Perhaps the best cover action thriller with a twist of humor is to be found in Killing Eve (2018).",

Now from what I understand Kim Jong Il (the eventual leader of North Korea) was an avid movie buff and wanted Sang OK Shin to produce a film along the lines of &quot;Godzilla&quot;. This movie is the final product. Unfortunately, this movie doesn&apos;t translate as well to world-wide audiences as its famous predecessor did. That&apos;s not to say that this movie is necessarily bad but it clearly had some weaknesses. For starters, the special effects were quite poor and the movie had some scenes which could have definitely been trimmed here and there. Along with that the movie I saw was filmed in Korean but had English subtitles. I only mention this because this is a film that is probably best suited for young children and subtitles simply won&apos;t suffice for that particular audience. Be that as it may I rate the movie as slightly below average.",

      "reviewBody": "Tagline: A star-stunned cast spoiled by a mediocre script \n\nReview by Neo: Imagine the 5 biggest TVB actors at the time starring in a movie together and within the five, there are little names like Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu Wai. So what can possibly go wrong, maybe it is due to the all too ordinary direction from veteran actor Eric Tsang or perhaps we can just blame it on the routine and blend script. The film is basically trying to say that one wrong act will lead to another one and eventually to the point of no return. A bleak and dark look into police corruption, director Tsang fails to make use of his 5 tigers (Andy Lau Tak-Wah, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, Felix Wong Yat-Wah, Miu Kiu-Wai, Ken Tong Chun-Yip) and the result is a brutally average flick that never rises above its genre convention. While it is okay to be efficient, there are moments that the audience actually feels bored and it doesn&apos;t help when the running time is clocked at just a little under 2 hours. Perhaps 30 minutes too long, The Tigers is ultimately a missed opportunity and a waste of once in a life time chance to see all 5 tigers in action.\n\nIt is almost amazing to witness the annoying performance of two superstars of Asian Cinema. The unbelievable have happened, Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Andy Lau are just plain annoying. Luckily, Leung manages to impresses in the scenes prior to his death in the car park and Lau manages to pick his act together and actually attempt to act upon the death of Leung. The second half provides an Andy Lau that shows glimpses of the actor Lau is right now.\n\nAs for the evil tiger (Ken Tong Chun-Yip), he never seems to be able to create anymore than a pretty much one-dimensional villain. Current TVB star Miu Kiu-Wai is dead pan wooden and Felix Wong Yat-Wah is just his typical angry filled face throughout. Shaw Brothers favourite Leung Kar Yan is the unlikely person to shine above the aforementioned tigers and his character is sympathetic enough for the audience to care about.\n\nAll in all, the star power of the 5 tigers is alone worthy for the price of the movie and while the movie is really like the case of an unfulfilling romance, it isn&apos;t exactly total downhill. There is no doubt that the script have let the 5 former and present TVB superstars down and for some of them luckily have gone on to better things. At the end of the day, The Tigers struggles to be average and all they are trying to say is that one mistake leads to another and eventually to the point of no return. Life as a corrupt cop sucks in The Tigers and so are the awaiting audience hoping for something better. With that being said, the film did gives the audience some answers to their questions, Tony Leung Chiu Wai can actually be annoying, Andy Lau showing glimpses of his future and Eric Tsang is a far better producer than director. Finishing off, The Tigers is really a movie that tries to be average and comes up falling short (Neo 2008) \n\nI rate it 5.75/10\n\n\n* www.thehkneo.com\n",

Read the true story of these two guys&apos; careers, documented in the book, Hit and Run, then watch Burn Hollywood Burn again. You will probably find the film twice as entertaining as the first time you watched it. After having last watched the film 7 years ago, I bought the DVD this week because I wanted to see if I could grab the title track that I liked, and I also clearly remembered (and liked) the graffiti art that was drawn for the movie title. Once I got the DVD in my hands, though, I watched the film all the way through again, and enjoyed it every bit as much as the first time I saw it.",

      "reviewBody": "A strange thing about the food: some of it, like the bird-cooked-in-pig&apos;s-bladder which Martha describes in loving detail in order to have something to talk about while she&apos;s with her therapist, sounds good, and perhaps even looks good, without being in the least bit appetising. You&apos;d have to be mad to actually eat anything that&apos;s been cooked in a pig&apos;s bladder. But Martha is probably right aesthetically, if not in any other way: if she says the best way to cook the bird is in a pig&apos;s bladder, then you&apos;d better believe it.\n\nMartha is a superb creation. She&apos;s a good chef. (She may be the best chef of any film ever made.) When her boss sends her to a therapist, she talks about food and cooking, which interest her, rather than about herself, which doesn&apos;t interest her. She goes to therapy because her boss orders her to, and when her therapist (who&apos;s no fool either) asks her why she thinks her boss orders her to, she says, as though considering the question for the first time, that she doesn&apos;t know  and she clearly doesn&apos;t care, either.\n\nWhen various people (her orphaned niece, an Italian cook) come along to disrupt her life, we&apos;re on her side in wanting her to retain control; and although these likable people DO successfully disrupt her life, she does successfully retain control; so everyone wins. And it&apos;s hard not to admire someone who can not only insult the philistines who eat at the restaurant where she works but who know how to do so properly. These people don&apos;t know how good they have it. I&apos;d rather be insulted by her than flattered by some spineless flunky.\n\nThe script, word for word, and moment for moment, is as perfectly judged as one of Martha&apos;s dishes. The IMDb user who says of Lina: &quot;She didn&apos;t cry when her mother died, but she was really upset when Martha forgot to pick her up. It wasn&apos;t her fault, it was the script&apos;s&quot; merely shows how much his sensibilities have been coarsened by Hollywood cliché. In fact, the film shows genuine insight into the way people naturally react, not the way lazy screenwriters would like to train them to react. Lina reacts to her mother&apos;s death not with the usual screen histrionics but by not eating. Tears are reserved (as they are in life) for less important misfortunes.\n\nThis is an assured, intelligent, charming film. Even the use of music shows an unerring touch. I&apos;m eager to see what Sandra Nettelbeck does next."

Tansania, Africa is the location where Ben (in the following Dudu-films he&apos;s called Jimmy Bondie) meets with his ADAC*-Bug!\n\nWhy Tansania? It has been a German colony far in the past. In the 70ies there had been many so called &quot;East-African-Safaries&quot; and this film deals with one of those Ralleys through the whole country! Now there appears a greedy and ambitious Baron who is obsessed with winning the race for any price. His stupid wife, brought him &quot;the fastest car in the world&quot;, the cheep Hollywood requisite &quot;Herbie&quot;!!! (here is built the connection between the famous 50ies/60ies &quot;Herbie-Films&quot; from Disney) But the Baron is disappointed, because the white bug with the number 53 only has scrap value! Anyway the Baron makes a road test through the Serengeti with the bug after having painted it yellow. But ex-Herbie has its own head and does what he wants, especially when it is insulted.\n\nDudu crashes against Ben&apos;s bike and stops when Ben shout &quot;stop&quot;! The Baron apologizes himself and changes the bug for the bike. Since then Ben is the new owner of Dudu, what means &quot;bug&quot; or &quot;little insect&quot; in Suaheli, the native language of Tansania. Ben decides to participate in the rally, but he only becomes the &quot;Service-Car&quot; of Mr. Buttler, a Scotsman who wants to win the race with a hovercraft! And because both motors are from Volkswagen Dudu is accepted to be the service car (therefore the allusion of ADAC, the famous German car insurance-company) Many times there appear some scenes of animal and rally documentations, which are mixed with the actual film. But I think that&apos;s done in a relatively good way although it often makes you smile anyway!\n\nMaybe the plot is seems to be confusing, but in the German version it is almost clear and entertaining (later Dudu gets involved in a diamond smuggling problem etc.).\n\nThe cool thing is that Dudu becomes in the further films an own character or identity. He does not maintain the Herbie-Soul, but becomes a computer controlled car so that he stops being a total copy of Herbie!",

      "reviewBody": "By the time King Vidor directed this &quot;Billy the Kid,&quot; he already had 36 movies under his belt (most of them silent), so it&apos;s weird that the movie seems so arbitrarily thrown together. Brutality and tenderness each try to crowd the other out. Somebody dies, and minutes later everyone&apos;s smiling again. I think the Western/Cowboy genre was still developing in Hollywood at the time (even after all those silent Westerns), and the addition of sound just threw another monkey wrench into the works. Nevertheless, you can tick off all the Western conventions and clichés as the film unfolds; they&apos;re all there. But it&apos;s like they&apos;re on steroids or something -- you never know when they&apos;re going to take on a life of their own. They just don&apos;t add up. I&apos;m tempted to give this movie an &quot;8&quot; rating just for its consummate strangeness, but I think a &quot;6&quot; is probably a fairer assessment.",

We start with &quot;Campo&quot; (Warner Baxter) in a small town with his friends, flirting outrageously, before they all head off into the countryside en route to Buenos Aires where he is racing his horse. Not long into their trip they encounter an aircraft that&apos;s broken down and onboard is acclaimed Parisian chanteuse &quot;Yvonne&quot; (Ketti Gallian). Stopping off briefly in an hotel, she races ahead for a performance and he follows on for his race - only to discover that his horse has been pinched and is now racing under the colours of &quot;Tito&quot; (J. Carrol Naish). Of course, &quot;Campo&quot; can&apos;t prove anything and after a court tells him to get lost he alights on his own solution. Like her plane, this just doesn&apos;t fly. For the most part it seems to be an excuse to showcase some Gaucho singing, dancing and boozing whilst Baxter&apos;s accent gets thicker and the photography looks more like a series of outtakes from a &quot;Zorro&quot; serial. Will he get his gal and the horse? Well maybe she can sing while he eats the horse? Anyway - the dialogue is shocking and I&apos;d just avoid, sorry.",

What happens after that is very hard to explain, it can only be seen . and that&apos;s what&apos;s special about this film,it&apos;s visually entertaining . The story ending might be strange and you might have many questions unanswered. but good films usually leave you wondering like that. Very good cast and amazing direction. And as was said in the film there&apos;s a fine line between what&apos;s real and what&apos;s not and what makes you want to cross that line Is curiosity.

      "reviewBody": "Obama supporters (e.g. the mainstream media) want you to believe that &quot;2016: Obama&apos;s America&quot; is a sensationalistic, white supremacist attack on President Barack Hussein Obama. It isn&apos;t. &quot;2016&quot; is a fact-based, artistically ambitious documentary, the product of an egghead intellectual, Dinesh D&apos;Souza, who himself is a college president, and who is non-white, Indian-born, the grandson of an anti-white grandfather. D&apos;Souza supports almost every point he makes with original material, including Obama&apos;s biography and on screen experts, including Shelby Steele, the eloquent, African American scholar, George Obama, the president&apos;s Kenyan half-brother, Kenyan villagers who knew Obama Sr. intimately, and US Comptroller General David Walker. \n\nThe film is shot in an artistically ambitious style, with lots of shaky camera work, off-center placement, explanatory animation, and depressing montages of garbage-strewn Kenyan, Indian, and Indonesian slums. \n\nIn fact, for many viewers this documentary will be entirely too cerebral and level-headed. This is not Michael Moore. It&apos;s not funny, it&apos;s not shocking, and it&apos;s less manipulative than lots of other election-year material. D&apos;Souza never exploits his subjects with the ruthlessness of a Michael Moore. I didn&apos;t laugh, I didn&apos;t gasp, and I didn&apos;t become outraged. I mostly compared what was being said to publicly available information on the subjects discussed and I found the film – dare one say it – reasonably responsible and informative. In fact, the film&apos;s one mistake may be that it does not talk down to viewers enough. Anti- colonial theory and action will be new to many viewers. Many will simply not know who Frantz Fanon is, for example, or even Shelby Steele. These scholars could have been introduced to the viewer more slowly, carefully, and thoroughly. \n\nDinesh D&apos;Souza was born in India, famous as the &quot;Jewel in the Crown&quot; of the British Empire. India was a hotbed of anti-colonial theorizing and activity. D&apos;Souza inherited this from his grandfather. As such, he sees Barack Hussein Obama, Jr., through the lens of anti-colonialism. D&apos;Souza supports this view of Obama with quotes from Obama&apos;s own work, interviews with people who know the Obama family, and scholars like Paul Kengor who has researched Obama&apos;s relationship with Frank Marshall Davis. \n\nD&apos;Souza argues, using Obama&apos;s own words from his memoirs, that Obama wants to fulfill his father&apos;s dream of anti-colonial political and economic action. Rich, white, Western people need to be shaken down in order to even the score with poor people of color living in formerly colonized countries like Kenya and Indonesia, and poor, exploited people of color living in Western countries. \n\nInterestingly, the lack of economic soundness of this grudge-and-race- based politics is argued by George Obama, the president&apos;s half-brother. George makes a very interesting observation. Compare the &quot;Asian tiger&quot; countries to formerly colonized countries in Africa. South Korea used to be at the same economic level as Kenya. South Korea has been able to advance in a way that Kenya has not. Why is that, George asks? The unstated but implied answer: not just colonization is to blame for the poverty of some formerly colonized countries. Rather, cultural and economic differences also play a role. Rather than pursuing the kind of race-and-grudge based politics and economics that have destroyed Mugabe&apos;s Zimbabwe, exploited people could benefit from learning from countries like South Korea. \n\nThe documentary veers into speculation toward the end, stating that President Obama wants to see the US in the debt crisis it faces now. That&apos;s the film&apos;s most outrageous speculation. As the Comptroller General explains, the debt crisis is very real. That Obama desires the debt crisis is mere speculation. The film also criticizes Obama for reducing nuclear warheads and NASA. Again, that Obama has taken these steps is fact. His motivation for doing so, as presented in the film, is mere speculation.",

      "reviewBody": "In 3 Tagen Bist Du Tot (Dead in Three Days) is labeled &quot;Austria&apos;s first horror film&quot;. A quite passable one, I might add. It probably won&apos;t become a milestone within the genre, but if you&apos;re looking for real suspense and gore, this movie has plenty to offer.\n\nLike many others, the film features a group of teenagers, more precisely two boys and two girls who have just graduated high school. While they&apos;re out celebrating, they all receive the same SMS: &quot;Within 3 days you will be dead&quot;. It has to be a (very) bad joke, they think. Until one of them is found dead in the river the following morning...\n\nI was positively surprised by this movie, mainly because the director, Andreas Prochaska (a former collaborator of Michael Haneke) knows how to terrify his audience even if the plot is all too familiar: 75% of the screenplay is shamelessly borrowed from other horror films, some blatantly (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Deep Red), others in a more subtle way (Halloween). There&apos;s also stuff from other kinds of flicks (a possible visual The Empire Strikes Back-reference).\n\nProchaska does, however, count on the surprise factor as well: not all in the script is a deja vu, and he takes advantage of those moments when we don&apos;t know what&apos;s gonna happen next to scare us witless, with almost sadistic joy (in terms of how off guard we&apos;re caught). People get hurt or killed in painful, stomach-churning ways (I had trouble sleeping for a few days after seeing the movie), and some victims are unexpected, too. This guy knows how to do horror, that&apos;s for sure. If only he&apos;d been a little nastier with the ending, like Greg McClean did on Wolf Creek.\n\nOverall, this is a decent horror film. Prochaska seems to have found a promising start for his directing career. If he takes better care of the script next time, he might even be able to join the likes of Carpenter and Romero in the genre&apos;s Hall of Fame.",

      "reviewBody": "Those with short attention spans and no appreciation for minimalism will balk at this film, which is probably why it has a laughable 4.3 rating (as of this review). However, as a huge fan of zombie films, I think this one is criminally underrated and for those with an appreciation for something more challenging, &quot;The Dead Outside&quot; delivers.\n\nThe premise is dirt simple: Danielle, a man who recently lost his wife and child in this national zombie epidemic, finds an empty house on his travels. He stops in for a bit and is discovered by a teenage girl named April, who has survived their on her own for many years.\n\nThe film mostly follows them in their time living together. It&apos;s a typical dynamic on paper, with Danielle being more humane and not wanting to kill the zombies, while April has no hesitation in killing them. While Danielle is fairly calm and collected, April is volatile and paranoid. Their dialogue and interaction are realistic and nuanced. Nothing feels cliché or forced here, and even the revelation of April&apos;s back story, which could&apos;ve easily been over the top, is well done.\n\nThe pacing is slow and methodical. Many smaller moments, such as Danielle taking a shower when the lights go out, or April chopping wood, adds to the feeling that we&apos;re watching life unfold rather than a traditional movie. It&apos;s helped by the camera work, almost always close in, adding to the intimacy and intensity. Combined with the beautiful but foggy and desolate setting, creates a gripping atmosphere.\n\nThe film builds into one of the most intense climaxes in a zombie film since &quot;Let Sleeping Corpses Lie&quot;, and when it was over, I wished that the film would go on longer. Not for any kind of loose ends left, but simply to see it continue.\n\nHighly recommended, especially if you&apos;re looking for something a bit different.",

      "reviewBody": "Project: Alf.  The most surprising thing about this movie is that it was made in 1996, when I believe (according to U.S. census data) a total of 5 people remembered the TV show.  Well, what can you say.  That wisecracking alien from Melmac is back for more in this laugh-out-loud comedy starring some actors, with notable appearances by Ed Begley, Jr. (a made-for-tv kind of guy) and Martin Sheen as the evil anti-Alf character.  I also did notice the guy who plays the underhand scientist Moyers is the same guy who gives the kid the blank check in the classic &quot;Blank Check.&quot; The plot goes like this:  Bad military guys want to kill Alf for some reason, and good military guys help him escape.  Along the way is the expected hilarity involving Alf interracting with humans.  There is also some kind of weird romantic sub-plot involving the two good military people, a man and woman (good news for you homophobes out there).  This romance ends with the guy asking his girlfriend (a superior officer) &quot;Permission to discuss that over dinner....?&quot;  Writing just don&apos;t get no cleverer than that. Overall, a good movie. If anything, watch it for the classic line where the good military guy, responding to the accusation that Alf had caused over 300 fires in the Tanner house, says &quot;I object!  The actual number was 264, and most of those were barbecue-related.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "Marketed as one of Sweden´s first real action movies ever, &quot;Noll Tolerans&quot; therefore has a lot to live up to. But in my eyes, this is more of a regular cop-thriller than a heavy action movie. \n\nOne problem is that &quot;Noll Tolerans&quot; showcases the biggest action scene five minutes into the movie, and every other action scene later on feels like a step down. The ending feels extremely tired. But you can´t deny that this is still very competent work.\n\nThe movie begins shortly before Christmas eve, when policeman Johan Falk (Jacob Eklund) runs into foul business on the street. After a frenetic car chase he is confronted with two jewel-thieves, and after a violent shootout one of the robbers gets killed. Thanks to witnesses the other criminal is later arrested. But he manages to threaten the witnesses to silence, and after a while the police force is after Johan Falk instead. Now he must prove he is innocent.\n\n&quot;Noll Tolerans&quot; is an ambitious movie, but you can´t deny that in the States this would have been a straight to video-release. The story is not interesting enough and the pace is awfully slow. Action fans can´t be too happy with this one, but it did get a sequel called &quot;Livvakterna&quot; two years later.\n\n2/5",

This flick is about a mysterious stranger who comes into the lives of three very different women and has a gorgeous Maine setting.\n\nThe only weak point is an out of place crime subplot.  But it&apos;s wrapped up not too shabbily by the cast, director, and screenwriter.  The screenplay could&apos;ve been better, but all in all it&apos;s a mildly amusing, slight, harmless movie.\n\nThis film made me also realize that actor Jake Weber, who plays a hitman in this film, was not Alan Cumming.  I always thought Alan was the guy from Meet Joe Black.  They look so much alike, I guess it was easy for me to confuse them as the same dude.\n\nI just wish old Rog would do some more dramatic roles in films like this. I always thought it would be great if Stanley Kubrick had cast Roger in Sydney Pollack&apos;s role in Eyes Wide Shut.  Kinda like how Quentin Tarantino took a chance on Robert Forester, another under appreciated actor, in Jackie Brown. Ah, well, what might have been...\n\nBut I, as usual, well, not that usual, digress.  See Bed &amp; Breakfast. Dig?"

Ray Harryhausen was the ultimate master of this technique, having trained under the likes of Willis O&apos;Brian. His work is still the inspiration for many of the special effects wizards today. Granted, the movies of the 1950&apos;s do seem stilted and silly, but quite frankly, the worst of them are probably still superior to most of the direct-to-video drek produced today, and likely better than most of the films produced by major studios. I was raised on films such as 20 Million Miles to Earth and have no problem letting my child watch films like this. I cannot say the same for most of what is released today. 20 Million Miles to Earth is a unique, fun film. It, like others of its kind, comes from a different era, when people were not as jaded and world-savvy as they are today. Save the critical eye for the more cynical, overproduced films of today. Enjoy it for what it is.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Love and Basketball&quot; is one of the most feminist and non-stereotypical teen-through-20something movies I&apos;ve ever seen. \n\nIt&apos;s in effect a tribute to Title IX and the WBNA, casually showing a girl with basketball dreams, and how it affects her personal life and those around her. Highly recommended for teens! \n\nAs good as Omar Epps was though, I thought he was a bit short to be believable as an NBA prospect.\n\nExcept for one talky section of the movie towards the end where everyone pretty much says the obvious about their relationships, the rest of the character development is done visually and through situations and not one sports movie (or African-American) cliché. It is a date movie because both leads change. \n\nStay through the credits to see a sweet shot at the end.\n\nI was girding for a hip hop soundtrack, but it&apos;s old school R &amp; B all the way and lovely to listen to (complete with a wonderful line that the audience really appreciated: &quot;Mom, why are you drinking? I haven&apos;t seen you drink so much since Marvin Gaye died.&quot; \n\n(originally written 5/6/2000)",

Because he actually acted quite well in this movie along with Sammo Hung who got out of his usual ways and acted a retard.\n\nIf you&apos;re used to Rush Hour or Shanghai Noon then you might be surprised that Jackie can actually act a complex character (unlike the stereo-types he did in Hollywood). Not many actors can cry (or at least drop a tear) in front of a camera and Jackie actually did it.\n\nSammo Hung plays quite well as Jackie&apos;s retarded brother and it must have been hard to act a retard (not to mention he dropped some tears too). We mostly get to see the two doing some action movies where the plot(s) have to get in line for the action, so it was good to see them do a movie where the plot comes in first row.\n\nYes I said it, unlike most of the movies they did together this one relies more on acting and plot and all the action is just a plus. I got quite touched with the way they both acted and the plot and the story was quite good too, very touching. There were times where I cried watching this one and I never expected to cry in a Jackie and Sammo movie so yes it is a good movie with good acting.\n\nBut although I gotta say it is not his best movie either. 8/10",

You can figure out what&apos;s going on well before the movie lets you in on it.\n\nA total bomb from director Figgis. The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese and the characters act the most stupidly of any characters I&apos;ve ever seen in the movies. This one will have you screaming at the screen at the stupidity of the characters. Lots of lightning and thunder. Wow am I ever scared. A thriller without the thrills. \n\nQuaid is one of my favorite actors and he&apos;s wasted in this.\n\nWretched, simply wretched."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Felicidades&quot; is a great movie, overlooked by its poor merchandising and the unknown nature of the director, which is an important propeller. The movie talks about people lost in a city that vanishes for one day, in Christmas Eve. Some are trying to get to their families, some do not have any. Some are finding them, some are in a rush, everyone is looking for another one.\n\nThis choral story goes around presenting extravagances and eccentricities, and funny but road-less characters. The city is dark, but not as dark in &quot;Evil&quot;. As dark in lonely, when all lights shut off and you are the only one still awake.\n\nThe movie is fantastic, smart and coated by a script flowing on true, pure human feelings. The loneliness that it transmits is impressive. The unreceptive echoes, the subdued lights, the empty roads. It seems that in every character&apos;s life, this Sad Side on Christmas will last forever.",

The movie has a style that may, if fact, be borrowed from many other sources, but when it&apos;s on the screen, it feels complete as its&apos; own. While the connections are not as surprising as some may say, they are certainly not spelled out for the viewer.\n\nThe dialog is a bit kitchy, but there in lies the movies&apos; charm. Reviewers stuck on the believability factor of such dialog seem to be limiting themselves to one cine-style that we&apos;d be limiting ourselves to only 5% (I&apos;m making up that number) of accessible films.\n\nLNS is a fun thinking mans&apos; thriller that is witty, fast fasted, stylishly interesting and ENTERTAINING!!! That&apos;s what I want out of a movie, entertainment.... for those who are looking for reality, read the papers, watch CNN, take a walk in somebody else&apos;s&apos; neighborhood. For those who like slick mysteries with interesting dialog rent or buy Lucky Number Sleven",

      "reviewBody": "There are better dinosaur movies out there than The Dinosaur Project(naming them though will be unfair) but there are definitely far worse like almost every dino movie released by SyFy or The Asylum. The Dinosaur Project is far from perfect or great, but it was entertaining and did have some things it did well. Is it better than the IMDb and what has been said about it? I think so. Some of the camera work did have a dizzying effect with some shakiness that at times didn&apos;t add anything. The acting is a case of it being acceptable in parts, Richard Dillane is very good actually and while underused so is Natasha Loring, most of the time actually it was the case, but being rather cheesy in other parts especially the last act. Matt Kane does look wooden and Peter Brooke wildly overplays. The villain was not written at all well, there was no real point to him(the dinosaurs were conflict enough) and some of his scenes belonged somewhere else altogether, while the last act got far too silly and stretched credibility to the limit. However, the scenery is beautiful and made good use of and the dinosaur effects are surprisingly good. The dinosaurs themselves are very believable and creepy and have more colourful personalities than the human characters, agreed about that lovely moment with the baby Ceratosaurussen. Wish we could have seen more of them. Some camera work is inventive, the music is jaunty and the movie does have a snappy script that doesn&apos;t pad things out too much and has some light-hearted humour that sounds easy rather than awkward. The story goes at breakneck speed and is mostly enjoyably fun with the attacks having some genuine tension. On the whole, a fun film that could have been executed better but is nowhere near as bad as some have cited to be. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

Don&apos;t know why this movie isn&apos;t much more talked about internationally.\n\nThe movie gives us a glimpse of the life in a traditional Beijing Opera training school, that Jackie Chan in some interviews always have talked about he grew up in. This particular school and teacher have produced Hongkongs most well acclaimed action superstars and movie directors that have shaped the industry for over a decade.\n\nIt&apos;s a wonderful time piece and takes us into the 1960ties nostalgic Hongkong which was beautifully put on film. The atmosphere of that time was captured splendidly. You cant get more authentic chinese Hongkong culture than this!\n\nThe child actors are endearing and you can feel the brotherhood amongst them and the hardships they had to endure for fame and fortune, aswell as the growing pains of being kids.\n\nSammo Hung himself as the master teacher did a good job of portraying the sometimes harsh teacher but with his heart in the right place.\n\nThat same teacher that learnt to let go of the turtle which represented his students, that lead to the birth of Hongkong most well known action superstars!",

The best... the bridge scene. While this video uses a number of partially computer generated scenes, these are very seamless to the viewer, who is left to enjoy a predictable, but exciting story.

      "reviewBody": "Emmanuelle bianca e nera (1976)\n\n** 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nEmmanuelle (Malisa Longo) wants to take over her father&apos;s slave plantation after she feels he&apos;s going too soft on them for only making them work ten hours a day. She&apos;s set to be married to Lawrence (Antonio Gismondo) but his attempted rape of a slave calls off his engagement after the slave forgives him. This sends Emanuelle into more of a rage against the slaves even though she has her own secret desires.\n\nLeave it to the Italians to pick up where America started and try to push it to new levels. MANDINGO was a controversial movie when it was released in America so it makes since for Italy to try and rip it off and why not just throw the Emmanuelle name in there as well? If you&apos;re looking for a hard-hitting drama then this probably won&apos;t be for you but if you enjoy a bit of trash and exploitation then the film actually delivers a good time.\n\nI should point out that this pre Civil War drama has some pretty campy moments including the melodramatic and preachy ending. I&apos;m not going to ruin it for people but I give the film credit for at least trying to say something positive about how everyone should respect all races. With that said, there&apos;s no question that this is an exploitation movie at heart so expect a lot of nudity, a couple rape scenes and of course a lot of violence towards the slaves.\n\nThis film obviously wouldn&apos;t go over too well today but I doubt many people will be watching it unless they&apos;re already an exploitation fan. The film benefits from the setting, which feels authentic and I&apos;d also argue that the violence is effective for what it is. You&apos;ve got various whippings and they take it a step further by throwing salt on their wounds. The Emmanuelle woman is a deranged psycho here and she&apos;s also a nymph, which just adds to the fun.\n\nThis film is also known as PLANTATION PASSION, which was the title of the print I watched. That&apos;s a pretty fitting title for this exploitation film that manages to keep you entertained throughout its trashy 81-minutes."

The head mistress (Lilli Palmer) is an abusive woman who forces her will onto the girls of the school but she seems to be unable to control her young son (John Moulder-Brown). Before long some of the girls start vanishing.\n\nNarciso Ibáñez Serrador&apos;s THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is a rather interesting Spanish horror film that became a hit back when it was originally released. The film did well throughout the world including its release in America but then it pretty much fell off the map. For years it was hard to find and it really became known for its story apparently inspiring Dario Argento and SUSPIRIA. The film certainly isn&apos;t a great one but if you&apos;re a fan of the genre then it&apos;s certainly worth watching.\n\nFor my money the best thing about the film was the atmosphere. I thought the director did a really good job at building up an atmosphere that worked a certain magic throughout the running time. I thought it managed to make you feel as if you were in the middle of this location and it certainly benefited the film. Another plus are the performances by the three leads. All of them are quite good in their roles and I especially liked Galbo and Palmer.\n\nFor me, the biggest issue with the film was the actual screenplay. Some have called this an early giallo but I really wouldn&apos;t considering the film that. The problem I had with the screenplay is that it never really builds up the mystery aspect. I mean, all the girls start to disappear yet there are only a handful of possible suspects and the film doesn&apos;t even try to play it up. It&apos;s as if the director just wanted a visual style and the before mentioned atmosphere.\n\nAnother problem is that there&apos;s really not too much that happens. There&apos;s not much of a story here and the film is extremely slow-moving at times. With that said, there are enough interesting moments to make the film worth watching."

      "reviewBody": "The reviews for this movie had not been good, although reviews for romantic comedies are notoriously unreliable. RomComs are not high art, and while there is still an abundance of difference between a good RomCom and a bad one, they are light entertainment and benefit from being viewed as such.\n\nAccidental Husband certainly had flaws, but was still a lot of fun. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a funny bloke, Uma is Uma (always at least good), Colin Firth is assured as always. I was impressed with an exchange between Jeffrey and Colin&apos;s characters which was unusually realistic for this sort of movie.\n\nSome commentators have expressed displeasure at the fate of Colin&apos;s character because they like the actor, but it is only a character.\n\nThe involvement of the Indian family was slightly curious, but enjoyable, and Ajay Naidu put in a solid performance as Deep.\n\nIf you are after a RomCom and you can cope with a bit of logical nonsense, you should find this an enjoyable diversion.",

Technically speaking, a wonderful movie with a great story, best songs, fine acting especially by Jimmy Sheirgill, Simi Chahal, Gurpreet Ghuggi, Seema Kaushal, Harby Sangha &amp; Mahabir Bhullar with their THETH Punjabi dialogue delivery. Above all a great performance by Madam Nirmal Rishi, but she had a very little role. Tarsem Jassar also performed well in a cameo appearance. Sorry i&apos;m giving it 9/10, because it was a little short in length. I personally feel that after the song REFUGEE, 10 more minutes should have been added to the movie. Good wishes to director Taran Jagpal &amp; writer Jass Grewal for making a movie as the same level of ANGREJ (2015) &amp; LAHORIYE (2017)..",

She crossed Canada at 16 years old campaigning against nuclear power and wrote a hit book attacking globalisation in her 20s.\n\nNow she has made a feel-good movie out of the economic catastrophe that hit Argentina, by following the weary campaign of unemployed steel workers to join a couple of hundred other factory occupations and take control of their abandoned steel works.\n\nKlein and spouse Avi Lewis were in Argentina for some six months, with a crew of 16 and a budget of about C$1m, so we could certainly expect results. Whether this resounding endorsement of worker co-ops (slogan: Fire The Boss) is quite what the NFB had in mind is not clear.\n\nAt a couple of points, I felt the film ruined Argentina offered was about the repulsive imp Carlos Menem and the murderous bourgeois traitors he represented. Who is going to purge those secret policemen who rubbed out some 30,000 lefties? When are those generals going to face a court? Why was Menem not in prison instead of running for president? But the survival tactics of the workers on the ground was a more humane story, and that is to Klein&apos;s credit."

The movie is filled with an all star cast, including Mickey Rooney (well Hugh) Judy Garland (another duh) Lana Turner and others. \n\nIt&apos;s basically a story about Andy Hardy (played by Mickey Rooney) who gets into some girl trouble, and is helped by his neighbors granddaughter (Judy Garland) who is staying for Christmas. Judy sings some wonderful songs in this movie, especially &quot;In-Between&quot; it&apos;s such a believable song for a young girl to sing. They try to pass Judy off as a 12 year old, but she does look older. other than that, it&apos;s perfect! \n\nJust Watch It.",

      "reviewBody": "Before my recent visit to Cambodia which included a short tour of S21, I did some reading on the prison and the complex events that led to its development and operation during the Democratic Kampuchea (Pol Pot) regime.\n\n This movie did a remarkable job filling in my sense of S21 that was not otherwise possible to experience through reading or even touring the prison. For example, interviews with two of the only seven survivors out of over 14,000 prisoners detained and killed at S21 was remarkable by itself as was the opening sequence of a former guard discussing the morality of his role with parents who no doubt felt the full brunt of the Khmer Rouge&apos;s brutality, yet survived.\n\nSeeing details such as the private cells, photography apparatus, the typewriters that clacked away to record prisoners&apos; tortured confessions, and the former guards&apos; convincing reenactment of their job as teenage guards at this grisly place was at the same time deeply disturbing and satisfying in improving my understanding of this total institution.  The very instruments of dehumanization - ammunition buckets used for toilets, the bare tile floors prisoners were shackled to between interrogations and torture, the windows open to mosquitoes and vermin allowed to feast on the prisoners - are both stark and subtle in their presentation.\n\nThose who expect anything more than a rudimentary understanding of this infamous killing machine may be disappointed.  Seeing this movie was at least as valuable as seeing the prison in person.  I especially recommend it for anyone who has visited S21 or expects to visit Cambodia."

And when the dust settles , one is left with another &quot;moral&quot; if a bit &quot;nouvelle vague in jeans &quot; adventure for the abdicated empress.\n\nIn fact,the most interesting side of this otherwise mediocre movie is Schneider &apos;s transformation : in her first scenes ,she&apos;s the serious highbrow,complete with austere hairdo and spectacles ;while writing about sex,she becomes the attractive sexy actress she would be in her later films such &quot; la piscine&quot; or &quot;les choses de la vie&quot; .\n\nIf you want to see a real risqué movie of Schneider in the glorious sanitized fifties , you&apos;ve got to choose the remake of &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; (1958) ,the movie she made after turning down the offer of 1,000,000 Marks to make a fourth &quot; Sissi&quot; ,much to her mother&apos;s displeasure."

      "reviewBody": "I was really delighted to see the DVD of &quot;Beach Red&quot; in a video store last week, and of course I immediately bought it. I see that several commentators here have said something like &quot;where did this come from, and how come I never saw it before?&quot; Indeed, it&apos;s become something of a rare film over the years. I saw it in 1967 with my uncle, who was a World War II veteran who served in Europe. I was about 14 then, and its style, which was strikingly progressive for that time, made a deep impression on me. To me it seemed moody and dream-like, and it&apos;s been so long since I saw it, or even any discussion of it, that I almost felt as if I had dreamed seeing it in the first place. I was bowled over by it at the time. My uncle didn&apos;t care for it, as I think he expected a more traditional war film. He was one of those &quot;sees things in black and white&quot; types of guys, and though he didn&apos;t bother to explain it to me, I think the internal monologues, flashbacks, sexual encounters, and humanizing of the enemy in a war film just didn&apos;t wash with him.\n\nNow, close to 40 years later, I finally saw it for a second time. I can see some clumsiness in the characterization and dialog that didn&apos;t strike me way back then. But I can also see why it seemed so audacious in 1967 as well. From my perspective, this was the first of what I would consider a &quot;modern&quot; war film that I experienced, and as such I tend to regard it as sort of a landmark. I can appreciate it more now as a pure ANTI-war film than I could back then, when it just struck me as strange, exotic, and titillating both for its sexual content and graphic violence. Just like the Sergio Leone spaghetti-westerns made traditional American westerns seem old-hat overnight, I could never look at traditional war films with the same eye again after seeing this back in 1967. I&apos;m very glad to make its acquaintance again after all these years."

      "reviewBody": "Made in the wake of THE CANNONBALL RUN (1981), this racing-car comedy actually features David Carradine in the lead, who had starred in the similar (but more violent) DEATH RACE 2000 (1975) and the unrelated CANNONBALL (1976). The heroine, then, is Stockard Channing and the villain Christopher Lee – appearing here in a silly Darth Vader get-up, albeit claiming to be a descendant of the Borgias and irritatingly prone to opera singing, not to mention being flanked by an unfunny and long-suffering &quot;navigator&quot;! \n\nThe African setting allows both ample travelogue footage and, ostensibly, added peril for the contenders; that said, the race itself is curiously lacking in excitement and, besides, while we are told there are as many as 93 participants, we only ever see a handful of stereotype members (Brits, French, Japanese, Australians and one female team) apart from the central rival duowho, needless to say, end up neck-and-neck near the finishing line but, unsurprisingly, Carradine and Channing emerge victorious in spite of Lee&apos;s every attempt to thwart their progression. Incidentally, this could have taken a leaf from the &quot;Wacky Races&quot; cartoons of the late 1960s, itself inspired by THE GREAT RACE (1965) – that is to say, it should have been broader, but perhaps the film-makers did not want to go the route of THE CANNONBALL RUNwhich rather let the result fall between two stools, hence s virtual obscurity since its year of release! \n\nWhile it is watchable enough for what it is, especially as the picture runs for a mere 86 minutes, there is hardly anything memorable going on for the entire duration – which makes the involvement of renowned producers Jules V. Levy and Arthur Gardner (their last effort) and Oscar-winning composer Ernest Gold all the more baffling!",

Bert&apos;s idea is so good in fact that, say there was an atomic bomb attack (no  stay with me here), Bert would probably come off not too bad. This public information film from the 1950&apos;s explains to school children what action to take if there is an nuclear attack in their area.\n\nWe all know about this film and we have all seen it spoofed in things like Simpsons and South park but I really do recommend that you watch it because it is genuinely hard to describe just how surreal and creepy it is. Here we have the Government speaking to their people of the time  the people who they were leading into a period of history where atomic bombs were used on others and also likely to be used on them. This is the official and cheerful advice that they gave to the children of their nation. In fairness I suppose it would have been worse to come out and say &quot;look  you&apos;re pretty much screwed&quot; because the public reaction might have been to question why their government is putting them in that situation, so here is what they did.\n\nDone in the same style as &quot;proper&quot; educational films, this is eerie to watch because you cannot mentally make the jump back in time when this might have been accepted. It is hard not to think of the fate of those people advised to avoid bad burns by hiding behind newspaper or by ensuring that they cover the back of their neck with their hands. With this in mind the cheerful voice of the presentation shouting the slogan &quot;duck and cover&quot; like a kids TV host is all the more jarring for it.\n\nFascinatingly disturbing stuff that is worth seeing even if it will only serve to upset and feed cynicism if you linger on it. That said though, it is nice to move past the easy spoofs that we all have seen and watch this for what it is."

      "reviewBody": "Although Yellowbeard with all the Monty Python alumni cast in it, the film gets a lot of other comic talents from both sides of the pond. The only thing that seemed to be missing were some Carry On regulars. Even a most serious actor like James Mason gets into the spirit of it and ironically by playing his role most straight as the Royal Navy captain.\n\nGraham Chapman is the notorious pirate Yellowbeard who was betrayed by his first mate Peter Boyle. But before that Chapman hid his treasure and was then captured by the Royal Navy where he&apos;s been in prison for many years. \n\nIn the meantime Yellowbeard may or may not have a son who would be Martin Hewitt. His mother has alternated between Yellowbeard being his father or Lord Peter Cook where Hewitt works as a gardener. Madeline Kahn who is the mother was a most generous lass when she was young.\n\nBefore long the entire cast is out on a treasure hunt. I count several films with pirate themes spoofed in this film. Even the Masterpiece Theater&apos;s First Churchills gets in the act with some brief but hilarious performances by Sussanah York as Sarah Churchill and Peter Bull as Queen Anne who has a flatulence problem.\n\nCheech and Chong are here as well as representatives of the Spanish Inquisition in the New World. Yellowbeard is a film with something in it for everyone.\n\nJack Sparrow would feel right at home with this bunch.",

      "name": "REPUBLIC OF SIN (Luis Bunuel, 1959) ***",
      "reviewBody": "With this, I begin a complete Luis Bunuel retrospective - in preparation for a proposed series of talks my twin brother Roderick and I have been invited to hold about our favorite film-maker. In keeping with the latter&apos;s own hatred of symmetry, I opted to start with those titles I am only marginally familiar with...but in reverse chronological order! Ironically, while REPUBLIC OF SIN was among the first films of his that I watched (on late-night Italian TV), it remains one of his least-known (and hardest-to-find) efforts. Indeed, recently I have had to speedily provide an Italian &quot;Facebook&quot; friend of mine with a copy of it - on account of a journalist acquaintance of his who was writing an article on the film itself! Though I concede it is only a minor work in Bunuel&apos;s canon, the rewards one reaps from the picture are still considerable - infused as it is with most of his typical concerns (right from the opening narration denouncing a quaint monastery as a symbol of European/Catholic oppression on the fictitious South American island on which it is exclusively set!).\n\nThe film - which would eventually be remade for French TV in 1993 - is perhaps best-remembered today for being the swan-song of its popular, handsome and talented leading man, Gerard Philipe, who died of cancer that same year at the young age of 36! Bunuel, having met him on the set of Yves Allegret&apos;s THE PROUD ONES (1953), had long wanted to work with the French star and, over the next few years, had unsuccessfully tried to set up adaptations of THE MONK (eventually filmed in 1973 with Franco Nero from Bunuel&apos;s own script) and THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF (filmed in 1995 from long-term Bunuel collaborator Jean-Claude Carriere&apos;s script) for this purpose! Though Philipe&apos;s customary sprightly charm was not required by the sullen premise anyway, the effect of the illness can be seen in his gaunt features and especially the character&apos;s own psychological/physical torment during the movie&apos;s latter stages. The fact, then, that the subject of a possible future with the heroine is often breached (but, sensibly, not attained) during the course of the film makes the whole all the more poignant. Incidentally, his naïve idealism is such that he even allows himself into an executive position, serving bosses that are always intrinsically corrupt. Actually, he is berated for this by his former mentor, now a political prisoner in the penal colony of El Pao. Even when Philipe becomes acting Governor himself, he has to answer to the State President (shown in just one scene as having more consideration for his prize horse than the nation he purports to lead) and, in a society stifled by bureaucratic red tape, the most subversive act of rebellion he can muster is to tear up the paperwork! \n\nPhilipe is wonderfully supported by Maria Felix, the most famous Mexican actress, who had previously worked in Italy in the somewhat hysterical 1951 peplum MESSALINA and in France, for Jean Renoir, on FRENCH CANCAN (1954). Here she portrays the despotic Governor&apos;s sultry but unloving wife. The former&apos;s murder at his birthday celebrations - in which famished peasants rush towards the tantalizing slabs of meat on defiant display - sets the narrative in motion; his successor (the splendid Jean Servais of RIFIFI [1955] fame) is equally despicable and soon he too embarks on a masochistic relationship with Felix (metaphorically essayed in a bullfighting scene where a matador is gored to death as one is wooing the other). Actually, Felix had fallen for Philipe (after the customary initial friction pertaining to class structure) and she dutifully intercedes on his behalf with the suavely sadistic Servais (at one point, he humiliatingly has her disrobe in his office!). Indeed, the director inserts his usual quota of sexual tension (involving Felix and the various men in her life) into an already ironic and twist-laden narrative: Philipe and Felix &apos;organize&apos; a prison revolt for which they hope Servais will be blamed and expelled from office but, really, he had secretly planned it all along so as to eliminate the political prisoners! The central couple then think of leaving the island for good but Philipe, guilt-ridden over the futile massacre, has second thoughts...which leads to Felix perishing in a car explosion while fleeing a checkpoint; finally, Philipe (a fervent political activist off-screen) condemns himself by wilfully disobeying his superior&apos;s orders.\n\nThe end result is the director&apos;s most overtly political film but also his least favorite among those he shot in the French language! Even so, it is aided immeasurably by frequent collaborator Gabriel Figueroa&apos;s harsh monochrome photography - a trademark of Bunuel&apos;s Mexican period; the film, in fact, can pretty much be seen as a companion piece to his more readily enjoyable DEATH IN THE GARDEN (1956), similarly a French co-production set on an island beset with political turmoil and, like that film, it also benefits from a notable musical score by Paul Misraki.\n\nEven if I watched REPUBLIC OF SIN on a 40&quot; TV screen, a lot of the time I could not keep up with the Italian subtitles (though my having studied French at school helped and the plot was, in any case, not all that difficult to follow) - while my Pioneer DVD had intermittent playback issues by freezing between chapters and occasionally letting out a deafening screech!",

      "reviewBody": "Probably the only time in cinema where Michael Jackson (&quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; specifically and an inspired dancr sequence) gets a transition into the Blue Danube waltz, and rhsn back again so that&apos;s certainly something!\n\nPlotless, rambling, and has more than a few moments where Fellini and his crew place actors and light and setting and music just so to make cinematic poetry: memories as stanzas broken up by the little bits where story appears to be taking place. It sounds contradictory, but what keeps it from being among the filmmaker&apos;s best is what is still very interesting about it: Benigni is s man who (after a little time to surmise) is out from a mental hospital and is wandering from town to town, looking for a woman that he adores from his past and interacts with other characters who have their own histories and mysteries and whatnot... And that&apos;s it, that&apos;s the movie - and all the while, to the director&apos;s credit, he gets a real performance out of his star and not merely circus shtick (which is what I assumed many years ago when I first heard of this that it would be).\n\nAs with many Fellini, it may just be too much to take in in one sitting, but on the other hand Im not sure I... Care that much about this character and his search for this woman who really doesn&apos;t want to see him. And yet, there are brilliant scenes and flashes of greatness through out, wild bits like the one man who gets married and when his wife has sex with him it becomes like being on an actual train that rocks and rolls and creates panedemonium and smoke, or the Blue Danube dance and everyone at the dance breaking out in applause, or that shot where all of those figures with big black garbage cans walk in formation into town. And other times, just as impressively, Fellini slows his usual madman roll snd lets Delli Colli keep the camera more still (or occasionally, something I don&apos;t remember from him before, handheld).\n\nAt its most enlightening and satisfying, it&apos;s a melancholy but entertaining journey through memory and not even desire so much as longing, like tbe ending with Benigni looking up at the moon. It&apos;s also about twenty minutes too long (that long sequence in the town square where, uh, suddenly there&apos;s a big screen up showing people crying and begging to a fake moon - it really dragged to nothing satisfying), and I wish there was a little more time to understand what the Prefect character was all about as a lost soul. But, even with its flaws, it&apos;s still a lovely experience because it&apos;s Fellini finding ways to rediscover his passions and interests in exploring memory, regret and the desire to want to fly in the sky, figuratively and literally.",

      "reviewBody": "I received a screener from the video store that I work at and I decided to give it a look. I didn&apos;t know what to expect because the premise is really odd. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is good. Some scenes are inappropriate, and make the movie less about the date with Drew and more about Brian Herzlinger&apos;s personal life, but this is forgivable because the rest of the film, the Drew-centered parts that is, are really fun. Without ruining anything, some of the things he does to try to meet Drew Barrymore are pretty funny, and pretty creative. Another beef would be that it is filmed in MiniDV, but you could argue it&apos;s part of the appeal of the movie. The strongest aspect of the film, in my opinion, is the editing. Although the production value is extremely low ($1100 from a game show) the editing is amazing.\n\nAfter I saw it, I came to IMDb to find out more about the filmmakers (the editor, particularly, whom I thought was really good). What I found was amazing... People were fighting over the message boards. Now that&apos;s just sad. I never usually post, I just visit for info, but I felt that this movie needed a fair review, from someone who&apos;s actually seen it. Some bits are too long, some bits aren&apos;t as funny, but overall it is an enjoyable experience.",

      "reviewBody": "In the history of French cinema, &quot;La Meilleure Façon De Marcher&quot; is considered an important film for two main reasons. Firstly, it is the best film directed by French director Claude Miller who has made extremely personal films about his protagonists: young and old alike, who show tremendous intellectual growth in order to emerge victorious despite facing tough personal problems. He was inspired by the giant of Swedish cinema Ingmar Bergman who once remarked that it is after having faced humiliation that a person gets the chance to be mature in life. This film is highly authentic as it is true to life in its depiction of events which happen both in a camp setting as well as in an educational setup. One has to simply watch one of his film better films &quot;L&apos;Effrontée&quot; starring Charlotte Gainsbourg in order to comprehend how close he places himself in order to understand the tough world of his protagonists. Secondly, this is an ideal film for learning more about famous French actor Patrick Dewaere who has excelled in anti hero role. The best way to walk is entertaining in its own manner while revealing a straight relationship angle involving an oppressor and his oppressed victim. As there is a free exchange of feelings and sentiments between these two persons, one gets the feeling that there is some sort of mutual appreciation for each other despite some simmering tension. From this film, it has been established without doubt that apart from the greatest &quot;God&quot; of French actors Monsieur Jean Gabin, if there is an actor who displays tremendous sense of screen presence and a range of diverse performances in French cinema then it is Patrice Dewaere who has won innumerable hearts with his films. In &apos;La Meilleure Façon De Marcher&quot;, one can retain his attitude of meanness with serenity. It is a shame that some so called established critics have failed to correctly assess this film&apos;s qualities as one of them has observed that this film suffers from a weak end which is utter non sense as it is a perfect device to depict two different time periods in which the film&apos;s protagonists have lived. One can conclude this film&apos;s assessment by stating that it shows that the best way to walk in any situation is to put best foot forward. It also depicts that one can tell the truth but have to be ready to pay the prize for doing it.",

      "reviewBody": "It was real surprising for me to find out how watchable this movie actually was. I mean, a movie in which a shark attacks a bunch of people trapped in a supermarket, after a tsunami hit, doesn&apos;t exactly sound like high quality stuff. As a matter of fact. you would normally expect a movie like this to be extremely bad and cheesy but the movie, as it turned out, was far from cheesy and simply was being pretty good for what it was.\n\nI still expected the worst, after the first 15 minutes or so, which wasn&apos;t exactly being a very promising start for the movie. It looked horrible and I feared for the rest of the movie. I expected it to be a very formulaic genre flick, in which nothing exciting or original ever happened. And even while the movie isn&apos;t being all that original, it still feels like a good watch, since it manages to entertain and takes itself serious enough.\n\nThat was perhaps being the key as to why the movie worked out; it took itself serious. Normally modern B-movies are very self aware and actors and directors obviously don&apos;t take their work all that serious. They make things deliberately cheesy to add to the fun factor and while this does work out at times, at others it makes the movie noting less but bad and annoying. In that regard it also was being refreshing to see how serious everybody involved took this movie. It definitely adds to the overall quality of the movie and its nice to see that this is a movie that took its audience serious and didn&apos;t treated them like a bunch of popcorn-eating-no-brainers, who only wanted to see lots of blood and nudity. The movie is not like that at all, even though the first 15 minutes would still suggest otherwise. Perhaps it was all deliberate and in the first 15 minutes they were like; &apos;this is what you expect us to do&apos; and what after that follows was &apos;but this is what we are going to do with the concept&apos;.\n\nThing I also liked about the movie was that it didn&apos;t featured one main, heroic character, in it, who saved everybody. instead there is a wide range of different characters in this, who all, just about, share an equal amount of screen time. None of them is pretending to be a hero, which also lets all of them all feel somewhat realistic and human-like.\n\nOn the downside; the special effects in this are pretty horrendous. Sort of funny that after 40-years, &quot;Jaws&quot; still has the most convincing looking shark in it. This movie too often relies on CGI effects, which aren&apos;t exactly of the best quality. But still, as far as shark movies go, this definitely is being one of the better ones, believe it or not.\n\nDefinitely watchable!\n\n6/10 \n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "THE PROMISE (Das Versprechen) by Margarethe von Trotta is must viewing. There is no easier and more entertaining manner to understand recent German, and Central European, history than by watching this film. It plays very well on video, and the interesting locales and action will excite those who dislike subtitles. THE PROMISE is an epic drama focusing on divisions: in love, in a nation, in its capital city, in its politics, and in love. Indeed a love story is the vehicle used for this extraordinary epic, recounting the three decades between the Berlin Wall&apos;s first barbed wire, and its fall. Some critics, forgetting what a historical epic requires, dismiss the film as cliche-ridden. Well, of course, &quot;War and Peace&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot;, were successful due to the use of composite characters or cliches. These are necessary to explain history in a medium like the cinema. Ms. von Trotta is to be congratulated not only for this and other great political films (i.e.&quot;Rosa Luxemburg&quot;) but for being one of the only German filmmakers to tackle the controversial topic of German reunification. A declared socialist from Western Germany, Ms von Trotta lends the film a point of view that is as unbiased as I can imagine. Don&apos;t miss it. A lot of people did because of the film&apos;s timing. The last thing I guess most Germans wanted to see at the movies in 1994 was a reminder of the results of reunification. For this reason, this great film was unfairly denied its place in European Film History.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie has 5 great things going for it: Madonna, Rosanna Arquette, the soundtrack, shot in 1984 and in New York City. Arquette plays Roberta Glass, a bored and ignored housewife who is obsessed with a couple she reads about in the personals, Jim and Susan. Roberta reads that Jim and Susan will meet at Battery Park the following day, and goes down to watch the two. As Jim and Susan part again for a few days, Roberta decides to follow Susan (Madonna) though the streets and into a clothing store, where Susan trades the store-owner her pyramid jacket for some rhinestone boots. When Susan leaves, Roberta buys the jacket, goes home and finds a key in one of the pockets. Roberta then puts an ad in the paper for Susan to meet her at Battery Park to pick up the key she left in the jacket. As Susan gets to the park, she is arrested for short-changing the cab driver, just as a thug who is after Susan mistakes Roberta for her. Roberta knocks herself out cold accidentally and wakes up believing she is Susan. The rest of the film is non-stop comedic confusion and madness, played out by some great talents including Laurie Metcalf as Roberta&apos;s sister-in-law, Leslie, and Aidan Quinn, Robert Joy and Mark Blum as the hapless unfortunate love interests of our heroines. Directed by Susan Seidelman (&quot;Smithereens&quot;). Highly recommended.",

One of the problems with this terrible movie is that are just too many unanswered questions. Mainly why does an android need to ransom the government? Why does Frank Zagarino (Who actually isn&apos;t too bad) act inexpressive at one moment and then spout out one-liners at one point. Also for some reason the producers have seen fit to rip off the mediocre Michael Dudikoff actioner Virtual Assassin right down to the letter. However Brian Genesse is no Michael Dudikoff (How unlikely do you see such a sentence?) and basically the movie has no interest in it&apos;s characters or indeed any plot angle. The action sequences are indifferently staged and my general observation was that they spent all their money on the look of the film but were completely baffled in making the movie itself interesting. The film&apos;s low budget special effects are good but with nothing else to hold your attention this becomes a tiresome effort.\n\n* out of 4-(Bad)",

The head of the ring the Barron, Guldo Mannari, tries to have the cash fenced into Italian Liars and US Traverlers Checks but is ambushed, at the fences office, by undercover cop Nico Giraldi, Thomas Millan. After a ten minute slug-fest the Barron is arrested and cuffed and later sent to the hospital as bait to get the Shelly gang to kidnap him to find out where he hid the money, which in reality Nico and the Roman PD. Grabbed by the Shelly mob, disguised as hospital workers, they get the information that they want from the Barron who tells them that the money is hidden in this old abandoned iron factory. Nico and the Roman police set up an ambush there of the Shelly Mob and after a wild shoot out and car motorcycle chase, with Nico on the bike,Shelly escapes from justice to the US Embessy in Rome! \n\nWe then find out that Norman Shelly is not just an American mobster in Rome but a high placed and Senior American diplomat, Richard Russo, at the US Embessy there and has immunity from arrest as long as he&apos;s at the American compound. Even though Nico can&apos;t arrest Shelly/Russo right then and there but gives the big time hood/diplomat something to remember him by with a hard kick in the midsection. It&apos;s also reviled, like Nico suspected, that Shelly/Russo was actually in charge of the robbery gang that robbed him of his 5 million dollars which was the result of a ransom that mobster/kidnapper Shelly/Russo got a while back. This was done to have the money later laundered by the fence and returned back to him clean and unmarked. \n\nThomas Millan as Nico styled himself after the NYPD crusading policeman Frank Serpico in the movie &quot;Cop in Blue Jeans&quot;. Nico had a giant poster of Al Pacino as Serpico in his shabby apartment. The girls and young women in the movie went completely Ga-Ga over him, like they would have done over the handsome and heroic Frank Serpico. Nico also has a pet white rat in the movie that he aptly named Serpico. There was also a sub-plot and love interest, for Nico, in the film involving young and pretty book publisher Signora Callani, Maria Rosaria, who&apos;s important Russian novel manuscript was stolen.\n\nNico being a former crook before he joined the Rome police Department got the manuscript back to Signora by using his long out of practice and dormant pick-pocketing skills.",

I haven&apos;t read the book, so can&apos;t say how faithful this adaptation is (obviously, it has been modernized). The transplanting into the modern day doesn&apos;t suffer from the usual stuffiness that such adaptations usually suffer from (eg Baz Luhrman&apos;s Romeo &amp; Juliet), and feels like a modern romantic-drama.\n\nSolid direction from Alfonso Cuaron. Pacing is generally good, though there are one or two patches where the movie drifts.\n\nEthan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow are solid, though not spectacular, in the lead roles. Good support from Chris Cooper, Anne Bancroft and Robert De Niro.",

A few ideas are scintillating here and there, waiting for someone to catch them and the whole documentary to forward a debate about Alternate Ways of Life possible far away from Consumer Society and the stress of insatiable capitalism. Instead &apos;Volem rien foutre al païs&apos; edits together points of view that are mainly drafts for structured thoughts. Most dialogue here sounds inarticulate, tentative or purely provocative. In the end it looks as if the movie makers realized only too late they had very little usable material. Yet they dare bring together almost 2 hours of incoherent archive footage and interviews of people living in would-be autarcy. But nothing adds up, accumulating is not directing and the whole stuff has no meaning.\n\nI really think any structured economic and political debate about alter-globalization would be more interesting than this cheap mess.",

She falls in love with building mate Dennis O&apos;Keefe (as David S. Cousins), a scientist; and, the two plan to marry. But, when Mr. O&apos;Keefe is called away on business, Ms. Lamarr gets snookered and lapses into her prior lifestyle. Although she comes to her senses in time to flee frisky John Loder (as Felix Courtland), her presence in his apartment makes Lamarr a murder suspect.\n\nSo, how does she explain all this to returning fiancé O&apos;Keefe? \n\nThis deliciously ludicrous, dated melodrama is gamely performed by Lamarr, who really pulls it off, with determination and beauty. These types of pictures are always easier to watch with an extremely attractive woman at the helm; and, &quot;Dishonored Lady&quot; is tailor-made for a beautiful Hollywood actress. Interestingly, Mr. Loder was, at the time, Lamarr&apos;s real-life husband - though, not for long. None of the men seem entirely up for Lamarr, but chatty Margaret Hamilton (after &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;) and catty Natalie Schafer (before &quot;Gilligan&apos;s Island&quot;) offer helpful support.\n\n****** Dishonored Lady (5/16/47) Robert Stevenson ~ Hedy Lamarr, Dennis O&apos;Keefe, John Loder, William Lundigan",

His acquaintance Tano (Martín Urruty), who had been tortured for a long period, had falsely accused Claudio of being a revolutionary. Along the months, Claudio is kept nude and handcuffed together with the prisoners El Gallego (Lautaro Delgado), El Vasco (Matías Marmorato) and Guillermo Fernández (Nazareno Casero) and submitted to all sort of humiliations and tortures, until the night they decide to escape from their imprisonment in the old mansion.\n\nThe dramatic &quot;Crónica de una Fuga&quot; is a true recollection of a dark period of dictatorship in South America sponsored by USA to fight the communism, more specifically in Argentina. The story is very well acted but limited to the situation of Claudio and the other three prisoners in the Sere Mansion and their escape. However it omits, for example, that Tano and the other prisoners have been certainly dropped airborne from an Air Force airplane (the Jeep indicates Air Force Argentine, and this was a common practice in the dictatorship period). My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Crônica de uma Fuga&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of an Escape&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I must say that when I read the synopsis for this film in the Chicago International Film Fest brochure it seemed interesting. It said that it was a documentary which explores the rich life of a notorious photographer who broke all sorts of new grounds in Japan. I thought that I would go and see the film in order to see how he had been influential and how he caused controversy only to see a film that was horribly disappointing. To me the movie played more as a tribute to a photographer that the filmmakers liked than a true documentary. I walked out of the theater having learned very little. The film is filled with interviews of people who both know and love Araki, people who are all on his side. When there is a controversial subject matter, as Araki&apos;s photos undoubtedly were, there are inevitably two sides to the argument. In this film the audience is only exposed to the side of that argument that loves the man and his work. I can&apos;t remember one negative thing that was said about Araki throughout the entire feature. In the end I felt as though I had watched a feature length tribute video that someone would show at Araki&apos;s birthday party or a family gathering, NOT a film that delved deep into the information and arguments surrounding a potentially rich subject.",

      "name": "A Nutshell Review: Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story",
      "reviewBody": "The premise of this movie is so similar to 2003&apos;s Seabiscuit, you&apos;d think you&apos;re watching yet another biography of a real horse in some extraordinary, inspiring film that might just make you want to head down to the nearest race course and observe a real race.\n\nBut Dreamer (or Sonador as the horse is named) takes a slightly different angle in this tale about second chances and comebacks. If compared to Seabiscuit, yes, we have a horse with great potential faced with the troubles of breaking a leg during a competitive race. As with all race horses, this means instant death, as they have no future value, and are bred for the sole purpose of racing.\n\nWe also have a superb trainer, Ben Crane, played by Kurt Russell, and the doctor (Holmes Osborne), the written-off jockey (Freddy Rodriguez), the stable-hand (Luis Guzman), etc. But here&apos;s where the similarities end. Dreamer is a more personal film, with family friendly characters, like the daughter (Dakota Fanning), the wife (Elizabeth Shue), and the grandfather (Kris Kristofferson). Nursing the horse back to health had actually brought the family closer together, and that in itself makes this film quite cliché in its many &quot;been-there-done-that&quot; before moments to touch.\n\nDakota Fanning has held her own against &quot;father-figure&quot; heavyweights like Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, and Tom Cruise, though many would have pointed out that she had rivaled Naomi Watts for the 2005 Scream Queen honors with her performance in War of the Worlds. Here, Fanning has returned to more credible acting, albeit in a safer role.\n\nDreamer: Inspired by a True Story, is a heartwarming tale about believing in oneself, having dreams, believing that you can achieve, and take action to achieve those dreams. While watching the movie, I can&apos;t help but chuckle at the parallels in seeing how my team and I are sticking together, just like those characters, in wanting to see our dream of making a short film, and entering it into competitions (in this case, the Breeder&apos;s Cup) come to a reality.\n\nIt&apos;s that kind of film, an inspiring one. It might be clichéd, the premise might be too good to be true, but hey, success might come to those who dare to dream, believe, and more importantly, do.",

      "reviewBody": "This, along with &quot;The Doom Generation&quot;, is one of my many favorite films. I remember showing this to quite a few people at different times, and two things seem to upset people the most: the bisexuality/homoeroticism and the loads of sex scenes that, depending on the scene, serve various purposes. One person I watched it with (she thought she was an intellectual and felt it was beneath her to sit through it) said there was no way this film could be saying anything important and called it a &quot;porno movie&quot;. Naturally, since this film shows not one exposed genital organ or even a bare female breast, her argument was ridiculous. As for the homosexual things that go on in the film, I think that that makes people upset because it depicts these characters as human beings with emotions (which homosexuals and bisexuals are) and/or because it turns them on. I love this movie for many reasons. It&apos;s very schizophrenic, always going back and forth from harsh realities to gutbusting humor, and sometimes managing to blend them together in a strange and equal mix. It seems that Gregg Araki was trying to defy expectations of him here, and that he was trying not to make a film easily judged as &quot;exploitation&quot;. This movie has more sex scenes than &quot;The Doom Generation&quot;, but they are not explicit at all. The reasons these scenes are erotic and entertaining is because Araki works with the characters and dialogue to make the sex interesting without showing any nudity other than the occasional male butt. Also, where there would be so many people to call &quot;The Doom Generation&quot; garbage for its constant use of obvious profanities, the dialogue in &quot;Nowhere&quot;, if you&apos;ll notice, was done without hardly any cusswords, unless you count the myriad of VERY creative slang terms poured all throughout. And as for the gore, there&apos;s one big scene and one brief, minor scene. What I find amazing is that even with these differences, &quot;Nowhere&quot; is no less fascinating and brutally effective than &quot;The Doom Generation&quot;. I love them both, and, no matter how many disagree, I believe Araki is a very important, skillful, and versatile cinematic artist. I&apos;ve decided to include no spoilers, but I do want to add one more thing: If you don&apos;t see any meaning to this, that still doesn&apos;t mean that it is completely meaningless and without a point."

      "reviewBody": "John Hurt inhabits this character completely. This is not a sequel to The Naked Civil Servant, it is a continuation of the story of Quentin Crisp. \n\nQuentin Crisp was a flamboyant and insightful &apos;homosexual&apos; who, after spending the first 73 years of his life in not-so-gay, olde England, moved to New York and was embraced by the art and literary communities there. He spoke in quotable soundbites that challenged the world&apos;s assumptions, and people&apos;s perceptions of each other through the stories he told.\n\nHis live performances were more of Q and A between himself and the audience, as he never failed to provide an opinion about any idea presented to him.\n\nThis film fearlessly bases it&apos;s integrity on John Hurt&apos;s performance and he doesn&apos;t let anyone down. Having played Crisp previously in a film based on Crisp&apos;s own book, The Naked Civil Servant, Hurt &quot;leaves nothing unpacked&quot; in his rendition of Crisp. When I think of Crisp now, I see John Hurt&apos;s face.\n\nStory-wise, I found this film very informative about a less-public time in the life of a courageously defiant man who refused to let society keep him in the closet, both in England and the U.S. Finally I got some clarity on why Crisp fell out of favour during the beginning of the AIDS crisis. It&apos;s unfortunate that Crisp&apos;s analysis of AIDS as a &quot;fad&quot; turned out to be true in some ways. Perhaps the disease isn&apos;t a fad, but certainly people&apos;s fear and behavioural changes were temporary, as we now see in increasing infection rates of young people. If only his insights weren&apos;t treated as simplistic in the midst of panic, or if Crisp had had the fortitude (at 75) to lead a change in attitudes, the fight against this disease might have followed a different trajectory. Unfortunately that was not Crisp&apos;s role to play.\n\nIf you enjoyed The Naked Civil Servant, you will likely find this film equally interesting. Hurt is remarkable, and Crisp&apos;s perspectives are still relevant.",

He&apos;s excellent as always, exuding energy and the action scenes are exciting and well staged, and rather lifts this adventure. The stunts are impressive such as as the one Nipur&apos;s friend, Namar, is being chased by soldiers atop the roofs of the Babylonian city. With nowhere to go, Namar leaps from the top of one of the buildings down onto two of men waiting below. There&apos;s nothing to cushion him below.\n\nThe villainy is always good in these type of films - Moira Orfei sizzles as the evil and duplicitous Ura and the guy who plays Balthazar is a true nut job. The slave capturing scenes and throwing them in the fire can be grim.",

This very simple drama of the life of an ordinary working man is turned into high tragedy through the wonderful talents of the filmmaker. The film is all the more impressive when one considers that it was made on the cheap in London, though set in New York. The low budget gives rise to one or two false notes, but the story is so well told that you easily forget about those. Perhaps the lack of budget was a blessing, in that it allowed the actors and director to concentrate on the more ineffable qualities of story-telling. I would love to see this film again. It should be revived so that many more people can appreciate the great talent of Edward Dmytrk and the social-realist style, of which it is a wonderful example.",

      "reviewBody": "When you are making a horror movie it always helps to have a few things around in the movie in order to help set the mood. Things like creaky old doors, a piano, and preferably an old and creepy looking house. Now these are not absolutes, but they can help for sure. Horror movies are not like other movies, because there are so many possibilities for sequels, just look at the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series. In 2011 James Wan and Leigh Whannell brought us &quot;Insidious&quot;, a story about a family that had unwelcome visitors in their house. The supernatural kind. \n\nThat family, the Lamberts, have gotten away from their house and the experience they had in it. Josh (Patrick Wilson), Renai (Rose Byrne), and their three children are all safe and move in with Josh&apos;s mom. At the beginning of the film you find out this is not Josh&apos;s fist experience with a sprit. It seems Josh has a gift where he sees dead people and with the help from Elise (Lin Shaye) he forgets that gift, until he uses it again to save his son from a place the living shouldn&apos;t be. That place I imagine is the same place Carol Anne from &quot;Poltergeist&quot; was in as well, but instead of talking through a TV, a tin can phone is used to communicate to the other side. Renai senses something is not right about Josh, a sentiment that is shared by Josh&apos;s mother as well. So with the help from a man named Carl (Steve Coulter) and two guys who provide the comic relief, they all set out to free Josh and his family from the evil that haunts them. \n\nThe story picks up exactly where the first film ended, which makes the chapter 2 a perfect title. There are so many more possible chapters to this story, because let&apos;s face it there are a lot of ghosts out there. &quot;Insidious: Chapter 2&quot; is part ghost story and part detective story, as we try to unravel what is following the Lamberts around. Lucky, unlike what he did with &quot;Saw&quot; we are still under the direction of James Wan and he keeps us on the same path as the first film. If you are going for jump out of your seat frights, then this is not the film for you. There are some moments that may make you jump a little, thanks to some good camera work, but this movie is more like &quot;Seven&quot; than say, &quot;The Conjuring&quot;. In a genre that seems to be getting everything right at the moment, &quot;Insidious: Chapter 2&quot; doesn&apos;t disappoint. The only thing that could improve, is to have a little less common sense moments, you know those moments where a character does the thing everyone knows they shouldn&apos;t. I think it is very fitting to release this film on Friday the 13th, because like that franchise, you hope this one also has a long life making us afraid to sleep with the lights off.\n\nBrian Taylor \n\nhttp://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/"

      "reviewBody": "Like most people (I would imagine) that have seen this film, my only reason for doing so was the fact that it stars Bruce Campbell. It&apos;s a good job Bruce is on board too; otherwise this cheap mess would be a complete dead loss. It&apos;s clear that the film&apos;s main influence was the classic action flick Die Hard, and indeed Assault on Dome 4 is basically a carbon copy of said film, except instead of being set on a skyscraper, it&apos;s set on a research facility somewhere in space. Bruce Campbell plays Alex Windham; an intergalactic terrorist. He breaks out of jail (it&apos;s supposed to be a very high security prison, but in my opinion the security is rather lax) and escapes into space along with a load of other convicts he has freed. They set their sights for Dome 4; a research facility that Alex wants to capture and use for his own special research program. Meanwhile, and unbeknown to Alex, Chas Moran - an ace &apos;peacekeeper&apos; (futuristic cop) is visiting his wife, who happens to work at Dome 4. The terrorists take the place hostage, while Chase attempts to bring them down on his own.\n\nI am extremely glad that Bruce Campbell is in this film; his scenes are really the only ones worth watching and he does seem to relish his role...but if I&apos;m honest, he was the wrong choice to play a terrorist. He spouts off one-liners and its lots of fun, but he doesn&apos;t look like a terrorist at all. On the other hand, Joseph Culp, who plays the &apos;hard as nails&apos; hero, doesn&apos;t look the part either! ...so the whole thing is a bit difficult to swallow. Still, there&apos;s plenty of fighting and shooting (maybe even too much) and some of it is decent; although director Gilbert Po would do well to lay off the slow motion. The plot itself does basically run in exactly the same way as Die Hard does, so anyone who&apos;s seen that (which should be everyone who has seen this) is likely to know exactly where it&apos;s going to go. A major problem for this film, though, is the fact that it&apos;s so difficult to like the hero - Chase Moran is just dull, and I found myself cheering on Bruce Campbell&apos;s terrorist for most of the film. Anyway, the ending is not too bad and while this film is cheap and hokey, it&apos;s worth a look for Bruce Campbell fans.",

      "reviewBody": "Scandal At Scourie is the eighth and last film starring Walter Pidgeon and Greer Garson and Pidgeon was for once playing a Canadian which was his native country. The two are a married couple and Pidgeon runs a mercantile and is active in local politics. Some of the party bosses are eying him for bigger things.\n\nThe two are childless and make a decision to adopt a little girl and you would think such matters would be divorced from politics on both sides of the 49th parallel. But little Donna Corcoran is a Catholic and the Garson and Pidgeon are Protestants. In fact Pidgeon is a deacon in their church. But they promise to continue raising her in the Catholic faith.\n\nThe orphanage where Corcoran came from was burned down and another kid adopted from the same orphanage starts spreading the rumor she did the deed. Pidgeon&apos;s bottom feeding opponent editor Philip Ober says that he only did this to curry favor with Catholic voters. And then some incidents happen and the film does make you wonder about whether Corcoran is a budding Patty McCormack.\n\nThe film&apos;s best asset is the matchless chemistry that Greer and Walter enjoyed on the screen. In a couple of years both would be gone from MGM as they and other big studios were getting shed of their big contract stars. Their scenes with each other and Greer&apos;s with Corcoran hold the film together.\n\nWhat is really undefined and weakly resolved is the character of Tony Taylor who plays the other orphan. He confesses to at least one of the other bad acts and there&apos;s evidence that he could be a bad seed. But as this is a film aimed at family audiences that&apos;s all badly papered over by the script.\n\nScandal At Scourie does not come up to the standards of Mrs. Miniver or Madame Curie, that&apos;s Pidgeon and Garson at their best. But it still is a decent family film and today&apos;s audience would still enjoy this tale of turn of the last century Canada.",

Even reading subtitles, I laughed out loud several times (not a good idea on a crowded plane, btw). Now it is possible that it was because I was in a confined environment with little or no outside stimulii for 8 hours that I found this piece highly entertaining, but I still have to rate this a 7 or 8 outta 10 for entertainment value.

The trial succeeds, but along the pregnancy, Virginia finds that something weird is happening with the fetus.\n\n&quot;The Unborn&quot; is a very reasonable low-budget horror movie. Bizarre in some moments, grotesque in others, and dark as a whole, this movie has a very strong and disturbing scene, when a pregnant woman stabs herself in the belly. Therefore, it is certainly not recommended to pregnant women watch this film. I do not agree with the comparison with the masterpiece &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby&quot;, since the stories are totally different, having in common only the pregnancy of something weird. I found this movie a good entertainment. My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Bebê Maldito&quot; (&quot;The Damned Baby&quot;)",

And more, until finally I had nothing else to do, so I popped it in the VCR and sat back. Two and half hours later (It was the director&apos;s cut- don&apos;t see the normal version as it is not nearly as good) it instantly became one of my favorite movies, so I rewound it and watched it again.\n\n\tTo date I have seen it four of five times, as it has problems, it&apos;s not very fast paced, but is terribly engaging and Fahey is superb in the lead. The writing isn&apos;t great, but is passable, and the computer effects, though far from the center of the story, are excellent.\n\n\tIf you haven&apos;t seen it yet, or have only seen the normal version, it is well worth the rental, or even purchase."

A bride elopes with her lover in the very day of her wedding. The groom follows the two lovers, and a knife fight takes place. The rivals stab each other and the only wedding that takes place is that one knotting their destinies together in death. A blood wedding.\n\nBesides from the unearthly beauty of the dance spilling out of the dancers bodies on the Flamenco rhythm, the film goes a long way toward shaping and determining the kind of thoughts one is able to have on the controversial topic of sinful love.",

      "reviewBody": "What a relief to see a film about the 17th century that does not feature Gerard Depardieu!  Wonderful fashion detailing and locations support a serious history lesson on how music and theater were key to the success of Louis XIV. One of the best exemplars of how young men measure themselves by their physical abilities, the film provides a unique timeline for the long reign of Louis.  He grows from an unsure child into a confident (well, yes, arrogant) man -- and partly this is accomplished through his passionate involvement in music and dance. Think of the foolish Emperor in &quot;Amadeus,&quot; telling Mozart there are &quot;too many notes,&quot; and then see this depiction of a king who actually understands and appreciates music.  Yes, of course, peasants were mistreated and millions starved, but we don&apos;t see that part of 17th century France. That is another story, another film.  This one is stunningly beautiful; like great art, some of these images may never fade from your mind&apos;s eye."

On the front cover was a picture of Robert Blake, Truman Capote, and Scott Wilson. The background for the picture was a desolate Kansas wheat field. I can remember to this day reading about how the film was made in the house that the murders occurred, and even that the horse of Nancy Clutter was used in the film. The Life article showed comparisons of the actors and the actual persons. When the movie was released, I could not wait to go see it. This movie is just as haunting today as it was in 1968.I have seen In Cold Blood many times and will probably see it many more times.........one of my favorite movies of all time............When Robert Blake was going through the trial of the murder of his wife, I could not help but think about his role in this movie.........."

      "name": "Great and massive real life gangster film from Hong Kong",
      "reviewBody": "Poon Man Kit directed To Be Number One and it is produced by the famous Johnny Mak. The film is based on real life gangster in Hong Kong and this film reminds very much of Scarface, but it definitely isn&apos;t any rip off since it&apos;s based on real and individual character, too. Both films give same kind of message and have similar kind of elements, and I really like these both. Ray Lui plays Ho, the main character in To Be Number One, who firstly is at the bottom (like Tony Montana), but soon begins to rise and reach the top in criminal world. Soon he is one of the chiefs in the criminal world and, unfortunately for him, betrayal and greed start to destroy his career and the lesson has begun..\n\nThis film is very long, it runs approximately 136 minutes which is pretty much for Hong Kong movie. Ray Lui is very professional and occasionally as manic in his performance as Al Pacino himself. Other actors are also fine and consist of many popular actors like Kent Cheng and Cecilia Yip. The theme of the film is the same as Scarface&apos;s and The Krays&apos; for instance. All these films depict power and greed and how they are capable of destroying everything that has been reached. In Number One, all the characters seem to betray and finally there aren&apos;t many that can be trusted on. Power and money corrupts, and that has been the main theme in many great films before and after To Be Number One. \n\nTechnically this film is brilliant, and the director of photography is no less than Peter Pau himself. He made the incredible photography in films like Bride With White Hair and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon among many other films. The dust and blue smoke are hypnotically alive in this film and the same unique atmosphere lasts throughout the whole film. All the interiors and exteriors are extraordinarily shot and also edited. The magic created by camera in Hong Kong movies is almost impossible to describe with words, and the result is always in these films something never, or very seldom, found in Western cinema. The film is perhaps little confusing at times, but that is also typical in Hong Kong movies. There are many characters and plot turns and they are usually hard to follow and fully understand at first viewing. The viewer must be patient and concentrated when watching these Orient films. I don&apos;t think Number One is too long as there are many important segments that demand long running time. When film is this professionally shot and made, the long running time doesn&apos;t even come to mind and the film goes smoothly before the viewer&apos;s eyes without ever feeling too long.\n\nThe violence is strong in this film, but it is never gratuitous or too explicit, even though a film this violent is not likely to come from Hollywood nowadays. The axe battle at the beginning is almost as brutal as the infamous chainsaw scene in DePalma&apos;s Scarface. Number One is very violent throughout the film but it serves only as an effective element to depict the mayhem and madness that takes place in the movie and inside its real life characters&apos; heads. The scenes of action are again very professionally and excitingly shot and done, and they really are unique when compared to other countries&apos; efforts.\n\nI give To Be Number One 8/10 and this is very noteworthy piece of Eastern cinema.",

It&apos;s more a live-action cartoon.\n\nJingle all the way is a movie I&apos;ve seen a couple of times now - and I&apos;ll watch it again and again. Good fun. 8/10.",

Coming closer he notices that it is a mermaid. Somehwo he has seen her before but by getting closer he sees that she has some kind of infection. He picks her up and takes her home to place her in a bath. She do ask to be painted by him and to use the colored puss coming out of her infection. Until then it&apos;s a bit ridiculous but the painter gets addicted to her and when the infection gets worse and she almost dies the worms come in. \n\nIt&apos;s from that point that this horror flick turns into a gruesome flick. First out of the puss do come the worms but if that&apos;s not enough she starts vomiting worms being alive and it&apos;s not faked. Naturally the mermaid do dies and the painter can&apos;t take it anymore and starts to cut her up. At the end we do have a twist and this gory flick is over. \n\nIt&apos;s a rather good entry into the franchise because it do has it flows. The worms can make viewers decide to turn it off but for people into Japanese stuff this is your thing.\n\nGore 3/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",

While it has become oddly fashionable in recent years to deride this kind of classic, innocent fantasy, the movie itself has aged very well, and it is likely to retain an appreciative audience for some time to come.\n\nThere&apos;s no doubt that part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from them being such old friends to so many cinema fans, but there are also good reasons why they have endured for so long, and have been able to hold up even after becoming so familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent but deep yearning that is easy to identify with. Likewise, the &apos;Oz&apos; characters are bizarre enough to remain interesting, but there is a core of substance that again is easy to believe in. Who does not feel that he or she could use at least one of the things that Dorothy&apos;s friends want?\n\nThe adaptation from the original story is done quite well, making fine choices for the characters and episodes that would work on film. The settings and visual effects may not impress the devotees of today&apos;s computer imagery, but in their time they certainly demonstrated a great deal of skill and planning, and even now, in their own way they are more believable than are most of the computer tricks that have become so overused.\n\nThe popular story has also been used for a number of more recent adaptations, and some of them have had some good points of their own. But this Wizard remains by far the most wonderful of the versions of the classic tale."

Check it out!",

      "reviewBody": "I was mainly interested in this film because of the subject - the predicament of a child genius. Half way through it I was captivated, not so much by the subject(in part because of the way it was handled), but by the child genius himself. Adam Hann-Byrd is thoroughly captivating. Rendering a sympathetic performance, he&apos;s almost bewitching! He even looks a lot like Jodie Foster. And it&apos;s to her credit as a director for finding such a perfect little actor to play such a complex role. Jodie Foster herself gives a moving performance as a struggling mother who is suddenly made to feel incapacitated, both financially and mentally, as the mother of a child prodigy. Diane Wiest&apos;s choice of characters has always been interesting. From &apos;Edward Scissorhands&apos; to &apos;Birdcage&apos;, &apos;Practical magic&apos; and still other films, she&apos;s usually played characters who are slightly quirky, odd or non-conformist, with a touch of humor in them. Over here she plays to perfection the role of the demanding, independent mentor of Fred Tate with a warped emotional intelligence. \n\nOne grouse though...as far Diane Wiest&apos;s character is concerned. I think her role is too much of an extreme as compared to Jodie Foster&apos;s. At the end of the film, Wiest&apos;s character, Jane Grierson ends up looking sheepish, repenting and even stupid to an extent. The end is almost sort of an ode to perfect motherhood, decrying the failure of the poor mentor spending tons of money by taking prodigies under her wing. It seems to say, child prodigies don&apos;t need all that specialized atmosphere, don&apos;t need special benefits, when in fact they do. I&apos;m not saying that they ought to be living in state-of-the-art cages where they will only interact with other prodigies. But they do need a lot of other benefits that ordinary schools which underestimate the intelligence of even &quot;normal&quot; people just cannot provide. Child geniuses need to be dealt with very sensitively, keeping in mind their advanced faculties all the time and an atmosphere has to be created for them to properly nurture their special gifts. Somehow this film, by showing Jane Grierson as obviously insensitive, indirectly puts forth a bad case for special training for child geniuses. The real test of motherhood and Dede&apos;s feelings of jealousy towards Jane would have been explored if Jane, along with her maternal feelings for Fred would have also been shown to be sensitive or considerate. Instead we are made to laugh at Jane because she offers Fred some brown fruit/veggie juice and he asks for Coke... So that&apos;s it. This film is good, not for the content or it&apos;s resolution, but for the acting. Kudos to Adam Hann-Byrd!"

We see footage of her said to have been aired for the first time. Eventually, in spite of omertà on a colossal scale, justice was done.

As Smoochy catapults to fame - scoring hit ratings and the affections of a jaded network executive Randolph makes the unsuspecting rhino the target of his numerous outrageous attempts to exact revenge and reclaim his status as America&apos;s sweetheart.\n\nThe good things about this movie: The movie is a dark comedy and to me that worked, because when you got a story about Robin Williams trying to kill or ruin a kid friendly pink rhino called Smoochy, you really can&apos;t take that seriously and the movie is aware of that and takes it like a joke. Edward Norton and Robin Williams both did great in this movie. Trying to beat each other to win the kids hearts by taking some dark turns. \n\nThe thing that didn&apos;t work: As I said before about the dark comedy and how it worked for me, well some scenes it lost that dark but funny tone and goes full serious at times. Some jokes didn&apos;t work for me and Danny DeVito directed this, now let me get something straight here; I don&apos;t hate Danny DeVito directing in this movie or any other movies that he did, his a good actor and a good director, but everybody can agree that most of his films allow on awkward close ups of actors looking straight into the camera or goofy and weird scenes with characters doing awkward stuff, all that is is this movie and let me tell you it&apos;s not pretty.\n\nOverall it&apos;s not a perfect movie but to me it&apos;s a lot of fun, but it&apos;s not for everybody, but if you want some cheesy, goofy fun than Smoochy is your film.",

      "reviewBody": "The gimmick in &quot;Intimate Strangers&quot; is that a young woman, Anna Delambre (Sandrine Bonnaire), mistakenly enters the office of a tax consultant, William Faber (Fabrice Luchini), instead of a psychoanalyst, and tells him her most intimate secrets. The question then arises: Did she make an honest mistake, or is the whole thing a setup? Which of the two is the doctor, and which is the patient? Is she telling the truth, or is she a pathological liar? And why does he maintain the illusion instead of calling her bluff?\n\n&quot;Intimate Strangers&quot; works well as a psychological thriller, an elaborate cat-and-mouse game. But it is also a meditation on loneliness and the lengths to which we are willing to go to overcome it ... or not. In other words, do we allow ourselves to be intimate with each other, or do we remain strangers walled in our fortresses of solitude?\n\nFabrice Luchini&apos;s character epitomizes the latter type of person. He leads a solitary and uneventful life, is obsessive-compulsively neat (he uses shoe trees, for heaven&apos;s sake), is unable to keep his on-and-off girlfriend happy, and voyeuristically observes the quiet joys and turbulent passions of his neighbors across the way. (Shades of &quot;Rear Window&quot;.) Other minor characters exhibit similar tics: his secretary admits to watching rubbish on television while gorging herself on potato chips, and the doorkeeper of the office building spends all her time watching an idiotic soap opera.\n\nSandrine Bonnaire is, as always, a lovely, delicate vision. She succeeds in conveying the mystery and intrigue of her character, and yet makes Anna wholly believable.\n\nUnfortunately, Fabrice Luchini does not lend the same degree of realism and reality to William. He is too stereotypically anal-retentive and full of hangups, and we never see William as more than two-dimensional. He remains basically the same, unchanged, even by the closing credits. In short, we never get to know him intimately. He begins and ends the film as simply strange."

      "reviewBody": "Expecting a thriller from the director who gave you such sloppy television soaps like &apos;KKusum&apos; and &apos;Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki&apos; is like expecting dance from Sunny Deol, acting from Kareena Kapoor or an original score from Bappi Lahiri. And I Know What he Did Last Summer. Ripped off a Hollywood flick and is now claiming that chill will run down spines this winter. Rather snores ran down nostrils. And he&apos;s not the only one to be blamed coz EKKta KKapoor&apos;s concept of thrillers are sadly restricted till &apos;Kahin Kissiiii Roz&apos; only. Pity Pity!!! So there&apos;s this college in Shimla (which looks like Switzerland) where psycho professors are appointed. A group of six friends accidentally run down their van over this psycho. Seized by guilt pangs the friends get separated. Three years later they reunite but the psycho is back and on a killing spree. (Now why did the killer wait for 3 years?) The essence of a suspense flick lies in the fact that the actual killer must turn out someone quite unexpected and not the usual suspects. But this movie miserably stumbles at the point where the identity of the killer is revealed. Moreover the climax where the murder mystery suddenly turns into a love story of an over-possessive woman (ala Gupt) is disgustingly disappointing. The director pathetically transforms the thriller into a triangular love story (the KKusum effect), stuffing it with a dozen redundant songs (which you have been hearing since the past few weeks on every K soap). The only mystery in the movie is that it starts with a flashback but you never know where the flashback ends.\n\nIt&apos;s still difficult to differentiate Tusshar from the junior artists in songs. And somebody please tell him that cowboys should dance around horses (and not cows as he does in the Ding-dong-Ding song, taking the term cowboy too literally). Esha&apos;s emotions still gives you loose motions.\n\nSo there&apos;s not a single department worth appreciating in this film, except for the slickly designed promos which successfully fool the cine goer. But guys, Dikhavo pe naa jao, apni akal lagao. Yahan, Kucch Nahi Hai.",

Let&apos;s face it, the original &apos;Gesuzza the Garibaldian Wife&apos; does not exactly trip off the tongue! This is not all that changed for when director Alessandro Blasetti came to re-edit his film in 1951 he very wisely expunged the original ending which featured Fascists marching ahead of Garibaldi veterans in the Mussolini Forum!\n\nAt the time a film about the Risorgimento with no star names was unlikely to have punters queueing round the block but eighty-seven years on we have a different perspective.\n\nThe conquest of Sicily is seen through the eyes of two peasants sensitively played by non-professionals which in itself makes this a forerunner of Neo-realism. There is a fair smattering of professionals such as Mario Ferrari whose professional status is evident from the moment he appears! Blasetti&apos;s depiction of the peasantry is sympathetic although historians have questioned how many were among Garibaldi&apos;s &apos;Thousand&apos; that fought at the Battle of Calatafimi.\n\nThis film is now regarded by some as Blasetti&apos;s masterpiece although that is debatable. Its Russian-style rapid cutting results in a certain lack of cohesion but it has immediacy, energy and &apos;heart&apos; which makes it thoroughly absorbing.\n\nBlasetti and his cinematographer Anchise Brizzi have captured brilliantly the strong emotion, high drama, bravery and utter chaos of that exceptional year 1860.",

      "reviewBody": "I first watched Ju-On: The Grudge (2002) earlier this year and was blown away, I felt rare horror-chills throughout. It became an instant Top 10 Horror Film! A couple of years earlier I saw the american The Grudge 1 &amp; 2: the first was nicely watchable but not scary. The sequel quite meh.\n\nNow I&apos;m on to my third version of the same story, tho&apos; The Curse (2000) was released first. Unlike the american version I got a couple of scare-chills down my shoulders! Just not as often as its bigger-budget remake Ju-On: The Grudge. The lower budget and samey feel of the different sections make The Curse feel less substantial than the epic trippy feels of the 2002 version, the acting is also a level below. It&apos;s still superior to the american version.\n\nFair warning: there is a horribly-disturbing scene involving a baby near the end. It&apos;s not graphic in a gore sense (you don&apos;t see an actual baby), but it&apos;s hard to watch. Neither the 2002 version nor the american-remake had such a scene...it&apos;s just a bit much, frankly (i&apos;m a parent of small kids so maybe a bit more sensitive).\n\nStill, The Curse is objectively an impressive low-budget effort, but is only really worth watching if you&apos;ve already seen the superior 2002 one, and are curious what the makers did before. It&apos;s essentially the same story.\n\nI will watch The Curse 2 next, as it appears that Ju-On: The Grudge 2 is its own thing. Tho&apos; not quite clear on that, and I don&apos;t wanna stumble on any spoilers by digging too deep.\n\nIt can get confusing to keep track, here&apos;s the Grudge films I&apos;ve seen so far:\n\nThe Grudge (USA 2004) - 6/10.\n\nThe Grudge 2 (USA 2006) - 4/10.\n\nJu-On: The Grudge (Japan 2002) - 9/10.\n\nJu-On: The Curse (Japan 2000) - 7/10.\n\nThe 2002 one is essential, and should be watched first for maximum impact. If The Curse 2 and/or Ju-On: The Grudge 2 are close to that quality then I may be tempted to check out all of them (there&apos;s at least five more related films after these!).",

Its badly directed, poorly shot, the acting is hammy beyond belief and even the props (check out the American car) are cheap beyond belief. I took my kids to see it in a half empty cinema and apart from a couple of Moms behind me who found it hysterical most of the children were bored stiff after the initial noisy farts. As a film school final film it could be passable but  as far as a British film being shown to the rest of the world.....its too embarrassing for words."

      "name": "both slyly self-aware and an enjoyably serious movie about ill-fated bourgeois",
      "reviewBody": "At this point in Claude Chabrol&apos;s career one might expect him to cut loose and do something just totally crazy and not to give a hoot about his consistent style as a director. A Girl Cut in Two, for better or worse, is still disciplined and carefully constructed and directed, and maybe because of this once in a while suffers from not wavering in its approach; it&apos;s kind of like That Almost Obscure Object of Desire. But within its set terms the film is enjoyable and even has a kind of biting underlying wit to the proceedings. \n\nI would think this film might appeal more to the middle or lower class as opposed to upper class and wealthy as the former can perhaps relish in this tumultuous love life of this weather girl Gabrielle (very beautiful Ludivine Sagnier, kind of a prettier Chloe Sevigny) and the classic &quot;turning the men&apos;s worlds upside down&quot; formula. As for fans of Chabrol, and this goes without saying it&apos;s not a great film, it&apos;s a sign that, like Woody Allen, he isn&apos;t going anywhere and still has some ideas kicking around.\n\nIt&apos;s about the effect Gabrielle has on a man twice her age, novelist Charles Saint-Denis (Francois Berleand in a quietly powerful and thoughtful performance), and a spoiled and possibly emotionally combustible guy more her age, Paul (Benoit Magimel, very good in that his performance is narrowed to being this creepy person). She really is head over heels for the older man, who sadly is also (happily) married to his wife of many years, while Paul does all but wave a sign saying &quot;pick me, I&apos;m free, pick me&quot; (with the line &quot;I get what I always want&quot; crossed out save for when he&apos;s drunk). It&apos;s like a double Catch 22 situation, leading up to a marriage, a murder, and other occurrences. Chabrol presents all of this in what appears to be a straightforward style, which usually suits him best, and within this comes out the moral complexities.\n\nThis could be enough for a decent movie, if maybe a little slight in the mostly bourgeois atmosphere, but Chabrol heaps on some social commentary to boot: it&apos;s not just Paul but also Charles that put up a kind of front of complacency that is hard to crack for Gabrielle. It&apos;s slightly playful, mostly harsh, but always controlled satire, not of the laugh-out-loud kind but where one might chuckle or raise an eyebrow at a plot point or scene of specific acting. It&apos;s an interesting approach which isn&apos;t entirely effective but never makes it boring. A Girl Cut in Two is acted just as it should (Caroline Silhol particularly gives a deliciously icy performance as Paul&apos;s mother), and is written and directed with a knowledge of its audience. 7.5/10",

I would include this film as one of the best of 2004 (so far) along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Garden State, Spartan, and Kill Bill Vol 2. Colin Farrell&apos;s character, Bobby Morrow is one of the most fascinating people I&apos;ve seen in the movies for some time. I hope his performance (and this film) are given the recognition they deserve. The rest of the performances are excellent as well. The screenplay and the direction are also very good, too. The story isn&apos;t something that we haven&apos;t seen on film before, but the characters and the way the film unfolds isn&apos;t your standard fare. Don&apos;t listen to the detractors, see this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Mark Brandon Read (Bana) gains a fierce reputation as a hard man [and the sobriquet: Chopper] as a consequence of &apos;hitting people just to get himself a name&apos;.  A very accurate observation even if &apos;Chopper&apos; himself maintains his only victims are &apos;low-life drug dealers&apos; and their ilk.\n\nExcellent example of film as story telling.  I saw this &apos;indie&apos; film on the same weekend as A Beautiful Mind and, my God, the lessons that shambles could have taken from this.  Chopper is economically and crisply written with the sweetest doses of irony; marvellously directed with a plethora of techniques that only ever serve the film and it&apos;s grossly engrossing story and acted by an ensemble high on talent and clearly working for one another. Bana is a stand-out as the bright, troubled and dangerous hard man making a pathetic journey to emotional as well as physical incarceration; walking a dramatic tight-rope of comedian/homicidal-maniac as he does so with admirable skill and thoroughly believable integrity.  Worth viewing by anyone who thinks they like all the ingredients of film and art to come together in the same project.  Not worth viewing by anybody who thought the same things came together in A Beautiful Mind!"

      "reviewBody": "A movie about one of the most renowned personalities of America&apos;s 20th century directed by one of its most respected directors made it one very highly on my &apos;to see&apos; list.\n\nThe film does not waste much time in giving us a sight of what a powerful even notorious personality the homonymous character is, including his very strong anti-communist sentiments. As far as his character goes he appears as swift to respond, highly intelligent but also highly paranoid, a predator, a hawk, always switched on, always on the edge, without any peace who did not appreciate having any limitations to his authority or power. During a very poignant dialogue towards the end, between Hoover and his assistant Tolson, it becomes very clear how Hoover did not appreciate criticism and were unable to handle the truth expecting others to simply accept his version of the truth.\n\nAs we are treated to a more intimate view in his life the closeness to his mother does not go undetected and neither it should as with all personality deficiencies (in men at least) the relationship with their mother is one to closely watch. It was because of her influence in Edgar that left him with a pervasive sense of threat as well as a hunger for power, an influence that amongst other things caused him to be socially limited. Even towards the end of the film where our main character has grown much older (frail physically but not emotionally), his ways have not been altered in any way and one could even presume that his megalomania and paranoia are grown even more.\n\nDespite the aspects of Edgar&apos;s character the audience might not come to like, Clint Eastwood does a superb job in making sure that Hoover&apos;s gifts are also highlighted which include: impressive energy levels, vigorous memory, capacity to detect patterns and an ability to receiver, process, comprehend &amp; communicate information extremely effectively.\n\nThough not a dark film, this biopic has dark undertones suited perhaps to the personality it portrays. There are very few outdoor scenes, little light in general, and it would also seem that J Edgar was the workaholic type who did not have much of a social or private life. Regarding his social life, he appears outgoing but not very sociable and in connection to his private life we are led to assume that he was a homosexual, which was a cause for him to suffer, perhaps loathe himself, due to the religiously incited anti-gay sentiment preached by his over controlling mother. His inability to fully accept who he was must have, beyond question, caused him plenty of frustration. On this matter, there&apos;s a poignant scene in the movie where his mother said (paraphrased): I&apos;d rather have a dead son than a gay son.\n\nWith the above in mind, one question that must be therefore raised is whether his quest for power and authority was driven by his ideas/values for a better society or because it provided him with a sense of self worth? Why wasn&apos;t&apos; he ever satisfied or willing to give up power? There is also some resemblance, albeit small, of &apos;The Aviator&apos; another biopic with DiCaprio in the leading role.\n\nDiCaprio gives a forceful performance and carries the film, which is part biopic &amp; part political drama, compellingly. If there is a criticism about this movie it would have to be that it is rather slow and often made me wonder as to where it is heading with the constant interaction between Hoover&apos;s youth and later years.\n\nThis is an accomplished biographical drama/character study that although it might not be to everyone&apos;s taste, nonetheless to those with a keen interest in politics or US history in the 20th century or simply those interested in finding out more about the enigmatic J. Edgar Hoover, this is the film to watch.",
