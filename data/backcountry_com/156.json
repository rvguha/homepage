Will upgrade crossbars to take advantage of basket&apos;s weight capacity.\r\n- felt completely happy with a 4hr drive up to 75MPH, with plenty of turns and some average bumps (not offroading).

I  ride tons at night and this allows me to put light exactly where I turn my head!\nAfter several seasons of use, the plastic latch is beginning to wear, but I will definitely purchase it again!\nAbsolutely love it!\n\nJust picked up another. Now my summer and snow helmets each have their own!",

I skied in the Smith goggles for six days, three days in Montana and three days in Vermont in different conditions - blue sky, low light, snowing. I&apos;m thoroughly disappointed with the Smith googles. I struggled to see contrast with the Smith goggles even when I switched the yellow low light lens. I was compared the Smith Chromapop lens and my old Oakley Prizm lens on back to back runs. The Oakley Prize lenses provide significantly better contrast, definition, and sharpness. Sadly I wasted $270 on my Smith goggles.",

Soles have great grip for hiking your bike back up to the top of the rocky bonus lines. I&apos;ve had these for 8 months riding 2-3 times a week and they&apos;re still in great condition. I usually only get about a year out of riding shoes but I fully expect these will last longer.",

Great traction when I&apos;m walking around to enjoy mid-ride views. On slabby rocks, I never hear my cleats clacking which also means no slipping around. They were comfortable right out of the box and by the second ride they felt broken in. Decent breathability too. I&apos;d get them again.",

I have a lot of Nemo products, and they are all great additions to my gear collection. For the 100L bag, it was much larger than I expected (100L is massive) even having multiple backpacks over the years from 10L to 50L. \r\n\r\nMy 100L bag has been used primarily for overlanding. \r\n\r\nThings I like about the 100L bag: \r\n\r\nFor its massive size, you can really cinch it down when you don&apos;t need all 100L&apos;s \r\nGiant zippers with a large leash on it. Makes zipping it up when full easier. \r\nMultiple handles and backpack straps. \r\nBiner loops\r\nA huge side pocket, probably 10L&apos;s on its own!\r\nExcellent material. You can&apos;t pick this thing up without noticing it feels and looks overbuilt. \r\n\r\nI haven&apos;t found anything I don&apos;t like about this bag yet but will repost an honest review update if I do come across something negative.",

I could just about fit a small person into this! \r\nWhen I&apos;m not transporting short people, this thing holds everything! My stargazer camp chair, large 4 person tent, sleeping bag and pad fit easily, along with my daughters little camp lantern and some clothes. All of that while maintaining the duffel configuration! Durable material stands up to being dropped and sliding down slopes well (personal experience), and the zipper is beefy enough to really compress things while zipping it shut.\r\nIf you&apos;re looking to pack your whole life into a duffel, this one should be your first choice!",

        "reviewBody": "I purchased the 100 liter thinking I’d rather have more than enough space than not enough—it holds A LOT. I also got this bag for many uses with initial intentions to carry my young son’s ice hockey gear for beginner classes once a week. It worked great for that but there are no ventilation holes so I might not use it as a dedicated hockey bag for multiple days a week for practice and games. The backpack straps are awesome if you need a more stable carry and use of both hands. I found using the opening a bit cumbersome when the bag isn’t full because it tends to want to collapse and close itself, but maybe it’s because it’s the XL 100 liter size. I got the black color and I have to say it’s a bit of a weird black to me because it had a green undertone which makes it look sun faded. It doesn’t bother me nor does it affect its functionality. Overall a very nice and versatile bag!",

This bag fits everything and stands up to airport checked luggage abuse. It held everything the baby needed including a full size pack and play. It&apos;s super light so you don&apos;t waste weight when the airline limit is 40-50 lbs. No it doesn&apos;t have wheels, but we use this bag as a tote every day of our trips. Everything the kid needs for grandparents house, the pool, camping...it fits. Not to mention the worlds greatest grocery bag, ski bag, mountain bike bag, etc ... Fits perfectly in our roof box and I don&apos;t worry about anything getting wet from snow or rain when you clip the duffle straps. The storage bag it ships in doubles as a dirty closes holder. The only flaw is that this bag is so massive the structure to hold it open as a tote seems to fold over when freestanding. I actually put another duffle (black hole) inside this bag on the return flight; not a problem. The whole family was asking where to get one.",

        "reviewBody": "We bought the 100L Double Haul simply because we wanted something massive, to stuff anything an everything into, for any occaison. We&apos;ve got just about every size of The North Face basecamp duffel and wanted to try a more &quot;open top&quot; style of gear hauler, to access gear a little easier. So far, absolutely love it! It&apos;s been the go-to bag for mountain biking, for us. We can have all of our full body armour, pads, full face helmets, shoes, food, for 3 people...with room to spare. It&apos;s so nice to have it all in a single bag and still be able to open it wide and easily sort through the items. We really haven&apos;t used it much in the other modes, but I&apos;ve tried it out and it&apos;s super versatile in that regard. We like the small pockets outside and inside, and also like you can connect the bag pouch inside to create another zippered pocket bag. One of the best things, and especially for such a massive bag, that it&apos;s folds flat for storage. So many folks have complimented on the bag, while we&apos;re gearing up, mainly on the size and ease of use. I&apos;d highly recommend this duffel and we will be getting more of the smaller sizes to add to our adventure travel set. And, you just can&apos;t beat the product is certified bluesign and made from recycled materials.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this top to replace one that is several years old that had gotten a couple of moth holes. The fabric is a bit more substantial than it was then, but is still the lightest weight underlayer I own. The fit is still form-fitting enough to easily wear as an underlayer without it feeling bulky. Love the low, broad neckline, too - it makes a nice cami-like scoop for peeking out from under the top of button-up shirts. I have a couple of these in the short-sleeve style as well. I love that Icebreaker offers products like this one that are flattering and feminine and suitable for everyday wear.",

        "reviewBody": "This boot immediately became one of my favorite boots I have ever owned and within a few miles became my all time favorite! First off the fit is small and and slightly narrow at least in a US 14. An Asolo 14 is easily 1/2 size larger than these, Lowa 14 is about a 1/4 size larger and same with Zamberlan.  The sole stiffness is perfect for a boot that can be used on and off trail with or without a pack. Gohunt calls them a 3 in stiffness when they are closer to a 4. They have excellent ankle support and are amazingly comfortable. Literally didn’t need to be broken in before I wore them on a 3 mile hike. Overall they appear to be very well made on par with other euro boots. 4 stars though why? After one hike one of the cord eyelets started coming out. It hasn’t fully failed but it’s growing in length. I ordered a second pair and so far they haven’t had the same issue.",

        "reviewBody": "Ive owned these boots for a year. I am pretty tough on my boots. For context  I work everyday in them (Im a landscaper) but also use them for regular hikes,  so they have been put through it.  Break in period was unnoticeable and they felt amazing right from the get go. Very sturdy and I love the security I get for my ankles for the type of work I do but also my hikes. They are still flexible enough in the toes to crouch/kneel and working extended periods without discomfort and I love the rigidity but also flexibilty in the right places in these boots. \n\n However I noticed a few months ago the waterproofing seems to not work nearly as well and even walking through long damp grass my feet get wet and they don&apos;t dry the fastest, this is probably my biggest complaint. The insole has bunched up at the toes and my feet are quite sore at the end of the work day. I&apos;m not sure if this could be remedied by just replacing insoles or not but the boot has become much less comfortable to wear for extended periods where it was extremely comfortable in the beginning and no soreness in my feet by the end of the day. These boots don&apos;t get too hot during summer days but definitely get chilly in winter work. They don&apos;t dry out terribly slow but also not the fastest, which can be miserable in rainy weather, wet terrain or cold/wet snowy days. \n\nThe exterior stitching and material has held together very well and nothing has begun to rip/split or tear other than one shoelace. This is probably the most impressive feature of the boots as many other boots I would have shredded externally by now. Tread on outsoles has worn evenly but has lost some grip and does not grab rocky, muddy trails or wet surfaces nearly as well but still handles decently enough. When I first got the boots I could tromp through anything without thinking, now I have to be a little more thoughtful and careful in certain terrain. \n\nHonestly one of the best boots I&apos;ve owned other than the issues I&apos;m running into with comfort, reduced grip and waterproofing and if these could be remedied I&apos;d call these just about perfect. If you are only using these for hiking you&apos;ll be set for a while.",

When they updated them, I ordered a pair and have a few months on them now. Several weeks this fall scouting the mountains of western North Carolina, the mountains of Utah, Colorado, and southern WVa. The predecessor fit my heels and narrower foot perfectly. These new boots fit great in the heel and may have a little more room in the toe box. These new boots don’t seem as stiff. Even flexing them on the floor and comparing them to the older models, they seem to not be as stiff. But they have been as comfortable as their predecessor under a 45 lb pack in the hills and mountains.",

They fit snug, offer great sun protection, are easy to get on (the 4yr old needs help getting it off sometimes, but the 7 and 6yr olds have no trouble) and are bright and easy to spot. We love having minimal skin that needs sunblock and choose them for their active fit. We don&apos;t have to worry about someone losing their trunks or bottoms in the surf and because they don&apos;t have a liner, we don&apos;t have to cut holes in the suit to get the fine grain sand out of the fabric-it all comes out in the wash. I recommend buying your kids current size-the room to grow works great and isn&apos;t baggy.",

It installs easily and the locking mechanism is great but we had to buy zip ties 500 miles into the trip to hold the forks together.  The wheel was separating them and coming loose.  Luckily we spotted the issue through our sun roof before the wheel fell out of the rack.  I would not recommend unless you only use it for short trips (&lt;100 miles)",

The cropped fit works great with bib style snow pants but also looks great with jeans as a non-ski jacket. I sized up to a large to accommodate sweaters etc underneath. Would buy again!",

The third time, they sent me back the jacket with the rip in it after I verified that Backcountry takes damaged items out of stock. Their compensation for these problems was absolutely pitiful. They didn’t care that their mistakes took away my time and energy. I just have to send it back for the third time and move on. Careful buying from them, they clearly put damaged items back in stock.",

These pants in size 4 are snug through the thigh which is not ideal for pedalling but the fabric is really lightweight and stretchy so it&apos;s not a problem. I can still fit a chamois short underneath these pants.",

        "reviewBody": "I was a little concerned that there was hardly any reviews and no “How to” videos on the Internet, showing use of this tool. After all, this was my first skin trimming project. It was for my wife’s touring set up. Needless to say, I didn’t want to screw it up. The set of skins is not cheap now days.\n\nBut my worries quickly went away as soon as I made my first cut. I went slow and steady, as was recommended by the pros using other tools. I must say, I was extremely happy with the result!\n\nThe best thing about this tool is, I did not have to offset the skins to make the cuts. That made the project extremely easy and quick. My cuts turned out to be smooth and precise. I did have to trim very short portions of the skins at the beginning and the end of the cut with a sharp knife.\n\nIn conclusion, I’m sure some purists will say that the old way of cutting skins is the best, but for someone like me, who’s not doing this a lot, but has a general understanding of how things should work, this tool performed exactly as it should!",

There are only two reasons I didn’t arrive at a five star; first I had to return my first pair and go down a size which wasn’t reflected in the product description, the second being that I’ve only had them for a month. All and all a great product. I’m looking to purchase the hybrid low bow and the Booker as well. I like the Chelsea style. I’ve owned some Ariat cowboy boots in the past. Although I think the boots were a superior product, I didn’t like the full height because the top seam would rub my calf. Thank you for making quality genuine leather boots at affordable prices!",

I originally bought them as a “dress shoe,” but you can also wear them casually. I did put leather conditioner (bees wax) on them, which did darken them a bit, but they are still nice and classy. I purchased them in size 10.5 wide but usually wear a size 12 running shoe.",

        "reviewBody": "These shoes were so comfortable right out of the box. I was really intrigued by the gaiter because I tend to get quite a few pebbles in my shoes on my long runs on our local trails. No more stopping to clean out my shoes! The gaiter is super functional, but also makes the shoe so comfortable. It hugs the foot well without being tight. This eliminates the need for a runner&apos;s knot or lace bite from having to really cinch down the laces. The shoe seems stable on the steep and technical trails and really wants to cruise on the flowy single track. In addition to the carbon plate making the miles go by faster and easier, it acts like a rock plate, dampening the force of landing on sharp, pointed rocks and roots. Overall, I couldn&apos;t be happier with this purchase.",

An obvious plus for the trail runner. It&apos;s very light. The gaiter is functional. It climbs ridiculously well. I&apos;m a consistent 10.5 in Hoka (Mafate speed, SPEEDGOAT, cielo, etc.).

        "reviewBody": "Just as the headline states, I bought these, they arrived on Tuesday, and my first run with them was that Saturday (today), and I ran my first 50k in shoes I had never run in before. I know, but I had a feeling they would work, and I went with my gut. I was rewarded. I had worn the Zegama 2 for all my training and planned to wear those for the race, but I wanted something lighter and with a plate, and these came out at the right time (especially the black and blue colorway!). They were a welcome roomier fit than the Zegama 2 also. Midsole was plenty soft and responsive, and the gator simply works 100%. No hot spots, wore my usual size and they fit great. It was a perfect experience. What I would warn potential buyers of is the soft toe-guard. Again, this was my first 50k, and the declines were steep and jam-packed with raquetball-sized rocks. A trip on one occasion, and the kick-up of a rock by one foot, which was subsequently punted by my other foot, smashed my big toe. The inexperience and sloppy running couldn&apos;t be blamed on the shoe of course, but the protection wasn&apos;t there to save my inexperienced and sloppy late-race running. Honestly though, more robust toe-guards could potentially catch the long toe, and that is a deal-breaker in my opinion, so I prefer the softer toe-guard. Just have to be careful. Bottom line, this shoe worked instantly for me out of the box, and it was an amazing run. Even in the final 10k of the 50k, I was still being taken care of by the shoe, with my legs saved, and my foot soles appreciating the protective and responsive midsole and split carbon plate. This has to be the best, if not top 3, trail shoes of the year. I have a feeling this will be a legendary shoe. You will be thrilled. They&apos;re worth it.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve had and still have many good-to-great trail shoes, but the Tecton X 3 really takes things to the next level for trail running. I&apos;m not an ultra runner and usually run in between 10~20 miles about 3 times per week around the trails in my very hilly neighborhood. So, yes, I do run the trails quite a lot although not ultra distances in one-go. But now that I have the Tecton X 3, I&apos;m going to give 50K a shot soon and then go from there. This shoe is a pure joy to run in. I&apos;ve got around 70 miles over 5 runs in this shoe in little over a week and each run felt better as the upper molds to my feet and the foam/plate in the midsole break in. It&apos;s bouncy and propulsive but still very comfortable underfoot and, most surprisingly, very stable - even on very uneven and mildly technical trails. I&apos;m in SoCal, so the trails are mostly smoothened dirt/gravel with rolling hills, so I haven&apos;t tested it on steep and rocky mountain trails yet. It&apos;s probably not the best for such terrains due to the stack height, but it should be okay. For relatively flat desert-like trails (West Coast), this shoe is a dream. The bounce and the propulsion coming from the PEBA foam and plate in the forefoot really makes hill climbs much easier and more fun and the extra foam on the heel along with the superb grip of the Vibram Litebase outsole makes the downhill runs exhilaratingly fun. And the comfort underfoot is just amazing. Even after a 15-mile run, I feel like I&apos;ve only gotten started in terms of comfort. The fit is a bit roomier than I expected and took me a little while to dial in with the right thickness socks and lacing, but I&apos;d say it&apos;s true to size. It felt a bit narrow on the side of the forefoot area although the toe-box is roomy enough for the toes to splay. Loosening the lacing a bit in that area while tightening more in the toe-box and the ankle/heel have fixed the issue and I don&apos;t experience any hot spots anymore. Overall, an amazing trail shoe and I&apos;m extremely happy with it.",

I was worried after reading the reviews that I would have trouble getting them on. I have been buying Merrell winter boots and hiking shoes for years and have never been disappointed so I took the chance.  These are now my favourite boots. I just love them!!!  I’ve had no problems getting them on nor zipper issues.  They are extremely comfortable, very well made and look great. I ordered them on a Tuesday around 5:30 pm and they were delivered early Thursday afternoon. What more could I ask for?  Thanks again Merrell for making a quality pair of boots.",

I now wear this one if I&apos;m out in the morning or evening and want to protect my tattoos from some sunlight.  I wear the other one if I&apos;m out in the middle of the day and want to stay cooler.  This one certainly protects from the sun and feels good; but, it&apos;s hot.",

I am 5&apos; 10&quot; and 187 lbs, I have the large, and am satisfied with my size choice.  Wearing sunscreen is a personal decision, I am never sure if I have applied thoroughly and covered exposed areas.  I like the idea of throwing on a shirt and feeling confident.  Honestly, my wife laughed at me when I put on the hood and observed my &quot;turtle head&quot; effect, but when I reminded her that it was an easy way to cover up my balding head and ears, she was all in.  Speaking of the hood, it is cut low enough to cover most of my forehead and brow.  Cool and breathable, thumb loops are optional and stay concealed and non-irritating when not deployed.  Again, well-constructed, and I am pleased with the color, a kind of light mint green blend.",

The shirt is long enough in all areas without being too wide and baggy. I will not run this through the dyer to keep the size as is. Needless to say, I recommend this shirt 100%.

The problem is the windscreen wings aren’t adjustable where they attach to the base of the stove ( like the Coleman gas camp stoves) and depending on pan size you may have no windscreen protection. \nIt’s not a deal breaker but, having two different pan sizes can help.\nVery good performing and well built stove.",

I won&apos;t be using that much most of the time, but it&apos;s great to know I can boil water really fast when you need to. \n\nIt&apos;s light for it&apos;s size due to the aluminum. \n\nIt has good build quality and looks like a very nice stove.\n\nThe ability to set the flame ultra low or extra high give me so much control. Less worry about burning my food at camp.\n\n\nCons:\nThe lid isn&apos;t held down tightly by the clamps, so if you have it standing up in your vehicle, it makes clanking sounds. \n\nThe edges are a little rough and can cut you. If it&apos;s a concern, just use tape off the sides and sand the edges down a bit. Not the end of the world.\n\nThe large size also means that it isn&apos;t compact and you need space to bring a 5lb,10lb, or 20lb propane with you since the 1lb one don&apos;t seem give it enough pressure to run the stove well.",

Seriously, who needs a 20, 000 BTU burner on a camp stove?

The easy attachment to a BD trekking pole is excellent for extending the saw for ECTs or long cuts.  Very easy and quite stable for an extension. A couple detractors: the position locking button for saw sticks out and easily gets jammed with snow and ice if cutting deeper than the blade, like when cutting ECT columns, and the blade flexes a bit more than desired. Slower, more careful cutting can give a straighter cut with this blade.",

They are very light and breath well and are incredibly comfortable. The included insole adjustment options are a really nice touch. Highly recommended!",

Laces are smaller than most shoelaces, feel like climbing accessory rope instead of common shoelaces.  Soles grip like glue on rocks.  Really like how these hug your feet and feel like they become part of your feet.  Minimalist hike shoe, but pack a lot of comfort, grip and flex where needed, solid where flex is not needed.  The heel pockets itself like custom Madd shoes.  Everybody&apos;s foot is different, I think I have what are considered Roman-toed feet and these work perfect for my feet.",

The brand has always held up well and maintained a great balance between form and function.  Unfortunately, this jacket was a disappointment from day one.  It arrived feeling stiff, synthetic, and frankly, cheap.  A wash and brief tumble with dryer balls seemed to help some. But now it is pilling all over and I&apos;ve needed to use a sweater shaver on it multiple times over the past two months.  Really disappointing from a company that has always held up well.",

I thought this would sit on my head well without folding or cuffing the beanie.  It did not, it came down too low, basically covering my eyes, unless I folded it over, which would make it not fit under my helmet.  It was also too tight on my head, making it uncomfortable.  I returned it due to these reasons.  Wish it was a bit less tall, and fit a little looser because it&apos;s nice looking hat otherwise, and merino wool is not paper thin like a lot of other merino beanies out there.  It also took like 2 weeks to arrive, and I&apos;m still waiting on my refund a week so after sending it.",

These shoes are comfortable on the foot, having a good fit, true to size and lacing up with good socks has them fitting my narrow feet very well. I have a pair of high top insulated walking shoes that I love but wanted a pair of low tops as my ankle was broken and the high tops rub on the scars. However, I do not like the sole on these shoes. I have worn them so I can’t return. The soles have hard ridges and so when I walk, it’s more of a “clomp”, making them noisier than my high-tops also. But the ridges feel hard against the ball of my foot when I walk. It’s hard to describe, and there doesn’t really look to be much difference in the design of my two pairs of walking shoes, but my high-tops are more comfortable to walk in. I will only buy walking shoes, Keen’s, in the future in store. I recommend only Keen’s to friends and will continue. The fit is perfect.",

The Sherpa keeps all of our family’s cookware, plates and utensils, coffee set up, clean up and some essentials like first aid kits all in one place. When the legs are extended the table is the same height as my folding table from Costco. It works great as a surface for the camp stove leaving my other table available for food prep. My only gripe is the zipper can be tough to get going. Overall an outstanding product.",

We could probably shove everything into two of the storage bags and use the bottom compartment, unzipped, to store the camp stove. We leave the table top in place so we can use the pocket for longer items like spatulas and tongs that won&apos;t  fit in the gear bags.  I love that the camp kitchen is modular, so everything is convenient; no digging through plastic bins.  I&apos;ve seen people go to great lengths to build camp kitchens like a cabinet maker, but this is smaller, lighter, and just as durable.  \r\n\r\nAssembly out of the box is not too bad, and sometimes one of the legs resists sliding (a little dry lube should keep that working).  \r\n\r\nWhen my brother and his wife joined me for the eclipse and saw how I had my site set up, they said, &quot;Let&apos;s just get whatever he has.&quot;",

        "reviewBody": "I own all three sizes of the pot, they all have their own uses and are each pretty fantastic. The marked maximum fill for the 1.0L pot is 0.5L, and for the 1.7L pot the marked maximum is 1.0L, while the 2.5L pot lacks a maximum fill marking. I regularly push above the max on the two smaller sizes which I think is safe as long as the flame is low (which should be better for efficiency anyway) and just keep a close eye on everything - obviously do that at your own risk though.\n\n My biggest gripe is that the 1.0L could probably shed quite a bit of mass with just a few tweaks. While I like the thick walls of the pot, I&apos;d be happy to have them slightly thinner which would trade some durability for lighter weight. Additionally, the handle is chunky at 17g, not including the cleat on the pot that the handle attaches to or the little ball + cable latch. Removing all that extra hardware from the pot could probably remove 25g total, and then users could either choose a cozy+fabric handle arrangement like the WindBurner 1.0L has or bring a pot lifter (there are commercially available pot lifters on the market that weigh less than 4g). Perhaps MSR could produce an additional pot for the reactor stove, like a 0.8L UL that had those changes? That would be an excellent upgrade to an already fantastic system",

So far I&apos;ve used them for hiking and biking and they have been great for both. Fit is perfect, just loose enough for comfort but not baggy. They stretch to match body movement. I&apos;m 5&apos;10 200 lb with a &quot;dad body&quot; and the 36&quot; waist fits well. It&apos;s only been about 15 degrees Celsius but I think they will be quite comfortable in the summer heat.

Purchased for my maritime abode, I envisioned them as my trusty non-slip allies. Alas, as I descended the ladder amidst rain’s embrace, they orchestrated a rather comical descent of my own. Even the stairs’ nonslip embellishments were no match for their slippery nature, nearly evicting me from the dockside. Proceed with caution, or perhaps a sense of adventure akin to a high seas escapade.",

I’m a 30 in waist/40 in hips and the large is nice and roomy but I cinch the waist quite a bit, maybe could have gone medium. Unfortunately the lightweight fabric on the pockets and thighs started piling within a few uses and after a couple weeks of daily use and now they look like a pair of cheap sweats. It’s not a place where my backpack rubs so there’s not a ton of friction, not sure how it’s even happened. My husband has had the men’s version of these for over a year in black and doesn’t have any piling. Slightly disappointing.",

My one complaint would be that the pants still fit pretty snug around the thigh and butt (my measurements are right in the middle of the suggested range for the size too). Form fitting isn&apos;t needed in this item and more room for movement and layering would be appreciated.",

The cuffs just barely fit over my Zero G boots in tour mode however, and I wish the beacon pocket was more secure like my old Mission pants. In avalanches, clothing can get torn and pockets can get ripped off- I like how the old style pants had an actual harness in the pocket that attaches to the waist belt. I like keeping my beacon in the pocket because it keeps it away from my radio and other gear when ski patrolling. The pockets could also be an inch or two higher, but overall I really like them and I sort of want them in purple now too!",

My new Divides do not have Gore-tex (which was my fault for not paying attention) and I really miss it! This shoe feels springy and light, fits nicely with my foot shape, and gives me that forward assist that I prefer with running/walking shoes. I use these for trail hiking and walking in adverse Michigan weather. I will really miss the Gore-tex in the spring!  However, I am keeping the shoes because I like the fit, colorway, and performance in drier conditions. Also, no break in period needed (which I can&apos;t say for the Gore-tex version!).",

The picture and the advertising for the Sock is misleading as it shows I believe what is a short crew sock but this is a very low / ankle sock and was not as shown or described as a quarter sock. This was misleading and unfortunate for me. Hopefully others don&apos;t make the same mistake looking at picture and assuming that it is the correct sock in the pictures.very disappointed.",

        "reviewBody": "This shoe’s liner will rip within days of use, even if sized comfortably. I would not recommend these to anyone. It’s very unfortunate that they basically remade the OG 510 dragon but it’s such a low quality control standard, that the shoe is not suited for climbing. It will not hold up to the wear and tear of rock climbing, especially outdoors. I ordered a Comfortably sized pair, and the lining on the heel ripped within 2 hour long bouldering sessions. I sent them back for warranty replacement and right when I got my package, I went straight to the gym to test them out to have both of the heels at the same spot within an hour of climbing. The first pair I thought was just effective, but that’s not the case. This company has horrible quality control standards and I would stay away from purchasing any of their products unless you wanna keep dealing with warranty replacements every couple days. It’s a shame that these shoes are made in America at the original 510 warehouses with some of the original employees that used to make the 510 shoes that we all know and love, and they can’t hold up for more than a day. A lot of people talk crap about the 510 China made shoes, but the heels don’t rip on those shoes and they hold up for at least a few months without any rips or delamination. Buyer beware!",

        "reviewBody": "I should preface this by saying that I&apos;m forever stuck between a medium and a large in almost all brands. The Medium size has a good fit in the chest/body, but feels very narrow in the shoulders/armpits, very short in sleeve length (maybe that&apos;s so it&apos;ll fit under long-sleeve jerseys? I don&apos;t know). If I sized up to a Large, I feel like the body would start to get baggy but the shoulder width and sleeve length might be more appropriate. Slim cut, but not fitted, and not very stretchy material.\n\nFabric is pretty lightweight, and reasonably breathable. Wicks sweat just okay, I would say a good temperature range for this base layer is 60-75*F (16-24*C). Definitely not recommended for properly chilly conditions. My main concern is durability. I have noticed a significant amount of pilling beginning on one sleeve after one use and a gentle (hand) wash. Time will tell.\n\nI wish I could say this was a steal at $35 that works as well as fancy expensive base layers, but alas it isn&apos;t so.",

I put about 150 miles on them and was very surprised. The sole stiffness is just right for hiking (much stiffer than sneakers), traction is good, and the gussets on the tip of the shoe and along the tongue do a good job of keeping out small stones and other debris. The most striking things are the great cushioning (no sore feet) and the stability. I can recommend them without hesitation. I just ordered a pair of the high top version of these for my wife!",

        "reviewBody": "These shoes are incredibly comfortable! The stack height and midsole are well-cushioned, but not so much that they feel unsupportive. The see-through mesh upper provides a ton of breathability for someone with hot feet (me). I generally wear sandals all summer to keep my feet cool, but I think with a thin sock these might do the trick! My favorite feature is the lug pattern on the bottom. By having flatter lugs that still provide some traction, these shoes walk well whether it&apos;s solid pavement or light rocky dirt trails. Naturally, that makes it perfect for those who like to sneak in a lunch hike or trail run while still providing smooth walking at the office. The wrap-around tongue and padding near the Achilles help a lot with dialing in fit and providing security and comfort. Quick note on heel-toe drop since I don&apos;t see it listed here or on the Vasque site. They do have quite a significant drop. I generally wear shoes at 5mm or less, so the higher drop is quite noticeable, but certainly not a bad thing.",

From climbing around on the rocks and balds of the Blue Ridge mountains, walking creeks with a fly rod, catching snakes in the swamps of south Florida, or snatching bass while I&apos;m out on my boat, these things have done it all. I&apos;ve pushed these shoes really hard, and have been super impressive with their grippyness on a variety of surfaces, the nice balance between cushion and flexibility, and how easy they are to get in and out of.  I never want to take these things off!!",

They were heavy but superbly reliable.\r\nI bought theses Salewa boots based on a friends endorsement. \r\nThey turned out to be a wonderful surprise. Since these boots were not locally available I followed Salewa’s sizing directions  closely, upsized  by 1/2  and they fit perfectly.  \r\nThey are 1/3 the weight of my Zamberlain boots yet fit my needs perfectly. Cold, wet, rocky trails have been no problem. \r\nMy new boots exceeded my expectations. Turned out to be a great decision. I’ll miss my old boots because they reminded me of past great trips but not for long.",

I traditionally use alpine trail runners and have not purchased a pair of boots for almost a decade at this point. With a high of 5 degrees, windchill in the negatives, and a couple inches of fresh snow, these boots were absolutely bomb proof. Sleek profile that act much beefier than they look.

Having been extremely satisfied with the Wildfire approach shoes, ai decided to try the Alp Mate Winter for work in AK. I am often in Katmai National Park and live in the nearby surrounding area all year long. These shoes literally grip ice as I walk. I was amazed at how much traction they provided on flat ice. I&apos;ve never owned shoes that grip ice so well. Like other Salewa shoes, they are super comfortable. From day one I was able to work a full 10-hour shift without any issues.  Salewa, please keep make these. They are simply the best shoes on the market for subfreezing temps in the mountains of southern Alaska.",

The zipper is tiny, literally looks like a dwlicate zipper that you&apos;d see on a dress. A boot like this should have a much more rugged &amp; substantial zipper. On the inside of the boot near the zipper there is a fold of material that rubs. And finally although the opening has a faus fur lining the foot of the boot isn&apos;t very insulated, it&apos;s more like a regular tennis shoe.",

Wear them to walk dog in cold winters and they are stylish enough to wear to nice event. Always get positive complements on them from my friends. I have very wide feet so bought half size up which I do with boots. I bought this latest version of the boot with the white sole and it’s as comfortable as my old pair.",

The leather uppers conform to the foot, the dual tightening knobs make for a snug fit where you need it and allow quick on and off. The carbon sole is super stiff. Now for my extra wide foot the fit is not perfect, but way better than many other options out there.",

        "reviewBody": "Tried this CX242 Wide, size 44, while searching for a low to medium volume shoe with a toe box that does not curve in against the big toe. \r\n\r\nThe Lake size chart recommended sizing from 43 to 43.5: I found the size 44 in both this model and the CX201 to be more accurate. My feet measure 272mm in length, 105mm wide at the balls/metatarsals of the feet, with toe splay a few mm wider than the balls/metatarsals, narrow to normal heel volume and low arches. For further reference, I have worn 44.5 in both Bont and Specialized current model shoes. I was hoping for the toe box room of the recently tried CX201s with more support and less volume throughout the rest of the shoe.\r\n \r\nThe heel cup and general fit were supportive and adjustable as Lake stated, up to the ball of the foot. Then the toe box curved in against the natural position of the big toe, even with this wide version and the adjustable panels of the upper. The unnatural curve is not as pronounced as in other brands but still too much forcing the big toe inward.\r\n\r\nThe CX201 sole with the CX242 upper would-be a near perfect shoe.\r\nThank you Backcountry for further fit details and allowing me to try both shoes.",

Owned a pair of Lake 219 Wides but then got hit and trashed my shoes in the process.  Went for the CX242 Wides as replacements and man, if I&apos;d only known....  These are, without doubt, the most comfortable bike shoe I&apos;ve used in 35 years of riding. Independent strap for forefoot accommodates my bunion and more squared-off toe box leaves room for the other toes.  Inner sole is pretty supportive and outersole is rigid enough for pretty serious recreational rider (100-125 miles a week).  \nIf you have problematic feet of the wide type, I highly recommend these.  They are spendy for an amateur, but worth every penny -- especially as the miles pile up. I never knew the 219&apos;s subtly cramped my feet, but these made me relax my toes.  I upsized 1/2 a size, but not sure if that&apos;s the shoes or my aging, enlarging feet.",

The 242 in a wide has a noticeably wider toe box than the standard width 242, and is the first cycling shoe that has fit my feet well. I also have a bony protrusion in the side of my foot that makes a standard shoe difficult to fit, and the adjustability of the 242 solves my problem. The shoes are very well made, and combined with the great fit make for a terrific shoe.",

The fabric is significantly thinner than it was previously, and the waistband has no structure anymore. These are a favourite pant of mine, I&apos;ve been wearing them for 12 years. This, unfortunately, may be the last one I buy. Not worth the money imo anymore unless you&apos;re looking for a very light pant. The difference in weight between these new ones and my old ones is noticeable. Pne thing i appreciated about these pants was the thickness of the material, I found it to be softer and more comfortable. Not loving the change.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve only had a few fleece jackets in my life. Most a long time ago. But recently, I&apos;ve been looking for a form fitting, mid layer, warm (but not hot) fleece to go under my Norrona shell or wear on it&apos;s own to the gym or for hikes when it&apos;s not below 35*. This fits the bill across the board! It&apos;s the best fleece I&apos;ve ever owned. Yes, it&apos;s more expensive than most products similar to it, but a lot of the time, you get what you pay for. And this jacket is amazing!\n\nThe fit is unreal... if you&apos;re in shape. I&apos;m very tall, fit and muscular, and it&apos;s very hard to find tops or jackets that fit my body. Tall body, long arms, but form fitting in the hips and waist, then a bit of room in the chest and shoulders for musculature. It&apos;s almost impossible to find that. Yet this jacket feels like it was custom made for me! I normally wear a L in almost all clothes, but it seems more and more like Outdoor brands and Sports gear is 1/2 a size to 1 full size smaller. I did some research all over the internet and the consensus was that this jacket fits a bit snug for it&apos;s size. So to size up. And I&apos;m glad I did! This XL fits like a normal L. Yet, the body and sleeves are nice and long! I&apos;m 6&apos;6&quot; and there&apos;s still a bit of room in the sleeves! And it actually comes down below belt level in the front and half way down my butt in the back. It&apos;s absolutely perfect!\n\nAnd it says it&apos;s 100% recycled material. Is warm, but not hot. Has a nice high collar, the wrists have a thumb holes and a soft spongy like performance shirt like material right at the end of the wrist. It&apos;s snug, but not tight and keeps wind from getting up the sleeves. It&apos;s a VERY nice little touch that other brands don&apos;t have. \n\nOverall, this is the best fleece I&apos;ve ever had and I love it! Fits like it&apos;s tailor made for me and grabbed it while it was on sale. Couldn&apos;t ask for more. \n\n\nOnly problem I have with the whole experience is Backcountry themselves. I had ordered another fleece jacket, it didn&apos;t fit and needed to talk with a gear expert about other options. The CS rep on the chat could not help. They also somehow, could not find any gear expert around to help?! Which makes no sense. Middle of the day on a weekday is prime business hrs. You&apos;d think they&apos;d have at least 1 or a few gear experts around to help answer gear questions, like they advertise that they have. But they didn&apos;t. The CS rep said they&apos;d get my questions to a gear expert and get back with me very soon. Well. it&apos;s bee 3-4 days and I haven&apos;t heard a thing and had to do a bunch of my own research scouring the internet. CS here and at most places is literally non-existent at this point in human existence. It&apos;s absolutely pathetic and I think I&apos;ve only had 1 or 2 great CS experiences with any company in the last 2-3 years. It makes me not want to shop with Backcountry anymore.",

Norrona tends to be a bit narrower in the midsection / chest area - so it won’t be a baggy fit.  If you are slender or athletically built, it will work great.  Has great pocket space.  Indigo blue is a very nice color, looks better in person and while he is wearing it than in pics.  Another high quality product from Norrona.",

        "reviewBody": "I now have two of these things, not sure why. I wear XL and the fit is fairly accurate, and they are very comfortable as a light jacket or a layer in the system. The colors on the other hand are a bit off, maybe we should call them muted. I have the Cold Black which is gray and Arednalin which is a funny orange/ red color.\n\nThey are not wind resistant but with a shell do what they are supposed to do. I managed to trash one of the zippers,  Norrona fixed it no charge.  I am a bit of a gear snob and the smashed bird brand is what I wear exclusively for climbing till I needed a pair of gor tex bibs/ pant for climbing in Scotland. I now have several pieces of Norrona gear and they have held up well and as I stated above, my fault and Norrona fixed it. \nI live in the PNW and have been using synthetic puff jackets for insulation ( light, pack well and if wrung out  will still keep you warm after a fashion) This fleece does fairly well when wet and body heat will dry things out a bit faster than puffs. More bulky so a trade off at times.\n\nAfter wearing these things ( Noronna gear in general) in some really bad weather and rough climbing I would say the gear competes with the Big Guys for performance, wear and price.",

        "reviewBody": "Love the actual more muted or toned down blue color vs the bright Olympian Blue shown in the pic. Its hard to describe but kind of an indigo blue steel that had a child with a brighter Olympia Blue. Way more classy color than the pic here on BC. \n  So fit wise at 5&apos;11&quot; in my socks and 170lbs with a 34 waist and in my 60&apos;s. Have a bit broader shoulders and longer arms so I chose a large over the medium which was a tailored painted on fit that would be used solely as a layering piece. The large still tailored down through the hips was just a better all around fit and still looks svelte. \n  So I have gone this route before to use under my Norrona GTX Lofoten shell and its great for in bounds but prolly not going to aggressively hike with it very much. It creates warmth but its not windproof. That&apos;s why I wear a small pack and carry a different insulation or wind blocking  mid layer to swap out. Really a nice piece though and glad to have it in the clothing quiv.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For ski season, this is an outstanding pack. First, on travel to the mountains, I was able to attach this to my Farpoint 55 which is helpful since I was planning on packing it in my ski bag, which would’ve been a tight fit. At the mountain, it’s a comfortable bag. It’s so quick and easy to attack your skis to the sides of the pack to give you hands free commute up certain ridge lines or even to and from lodging. Extremely helpful if you have a 5 year old kid who doesn’t carry any of his gear. The rescue pocket easily stores your rescue/med gear for quick access. The goggle safe pocket is a great touch. Accessing the main compartment via the back panel vs the top is also well thought out especially when touring. Just laid my bag on the skis and no issues with snow breaking the threshold or the bag falling over when your in this uncomfortable stress positions. I’m gonna try the osprey camel bag next time, tried to use one I typically use for hiking but it wasn’t sized quite right and kept kinking the line. I wish there were one or two gear loops and maybe a vertical ratch strap for a rope. I’ll play with that more next year. It is also a very durable feeling pack. I’ll most likely do a video next year as I have more things to add.",

This was an incredible upgrade. There is easy-access backcountry-gear specific niches for everything. Avalanche gear, goggles, helmet, skins, clothing layers, water bladder, and snacks.  I really cannot imagine a better designed pack for backcountry day trip. (Would be too small for overnight hut to huts).",

I will also ride across fields or dirt paths. This cart worked very well on all of the above. But note the fat tires on my bike make the cart very close to the bike. My 3 year old grandson can touch the back wheel with his feet. We would need an extension (which I have not looked into). \nAs well I have taken this out when it has been raining a small amount. The tires spit mud onto the cart. So just make sure you have the clear cover that is with the cart down. Or you might have screaming kids. Lol\nAs a side note. Be aware you will need an additional attachment to fix it to a e-bike if you have a hub drive bike. \nOverall the cart seams well made and the kids love it.",
