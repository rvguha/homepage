      "reviewBody": "Probably the best role Robert Taylor had in the last five years of his life was in this made for television western, Return of the Gunfighter. Though no new dramatic trails are broken here, Taylor is just right for the part of a character very much like Gregory Peck&apos;s Jim Ringo in The Gunfighter.\n\nUnlike Peck who&apos;s returned to a wife and child he abandoned for the wild ways of his youth, Taylor has no family. We meet him after he cashes out of a poker game after catching one of the players cheating. When the cheat objects and draws on him, Taylor shoots him down and just mutters &quot;why won&apos;t they leave me alone.&quot; \n\nHe&apos;s just tired of it all, but it turns out his skill is needed by an old friend Rodolfo Hoyos who&apos;s being forced off his land. Taylor is summoned but arrives too late.\n\nHe does pick up a traveling companion of sorts in young gun Chad Everett who&apos;s got three mean brothers on his trail. Let&apos;s say that the two of them help each other in their situations, though for Everett it does cause a crisis of conscience as you&apos;ll see if you watch the film.\n\nAnd watch it you should. Robert Taylor liked doing westerns, you can see it in his performances in them. He made fun of the &apos;iron jockstrap&apos; parts like Ivanhoe, but he loved going west. Personally I think he should have concentrated on them in the sixties or looked for a big budget television series like his ex-wife Barbara Stanwyck had.\n\nTaylor&apos;s chief nemesis is Lyle Bettger the man who killed his friend and others. Bettger once again brings one of his sadistic psychos to the screen and effectively. This one does have a healthy respect for Taylor&apos;s reputation and skill as he tries to tell young punk John David Chandler, when Chandler seems to buffalo Taylor in a saloon. The fact that Chandler had several friends with him, kind of stacked the deck. It&apos;s a scene very similar to one that John Wayne and George Kennedy did in The Sons of Katie Elder.\n\nThis was the second of two films that Chad Everett did with Robert Taylor and he always spoke of Taylor&apos;s kindness to him as a young player and his generosity in that he never worried about Everett stealing any scenes. \n\nTaylor was back at MGM for this final film with them, the studio where he held the longest contract in screen history. Had Return of the Gunfighter been made 10 year earlier, it surely would have gotten a theatrical release.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Bullet in the Head&quot; (aka &quot;Die xue jie tou&quot;) is a classic Hong Kong action movie from the grandfather of action movies director John Woo, of course. And anyone with a taste for Hong Kong movies would have to have lived under a rock if never having come across a John Woo action movie.\n\nJohn Woo sort of deviates from his usual formula with &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot; in comparison to a movie such as &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;, for example. While &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot; definitely has lots of action sequences, it is not really as action packed as most of his other movies. Instead, there is a healthy amount of drama and character building in &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot;. Which was actually serving the movie quite well.\n\nAnd even in 2019, this action movie from 1990 still stands tall and is definitely watchable and enjoyable still. Sure, you just don&apos;t concern yourself about the oddly colored blood used, but focus on the action and the acting.\n\n&quot;Bullet in the Head&quot; features some very iconic Hong Kong actors, such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Jacky Cheung and Simon Yam, whom all carried the movie quite nicely. And the supportive cast were also doing great jobs.\n\nI have watched &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot; three times or so by now, since it was initially released and I had it on VHS back in the day. And I will say that the movie definitely has value to it, as it can viewed again and again with years in between.\n\nIf you like Hong Kong action movies from the golden age of over-the-top-action, then you will definitely have to watch &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot;.",

The movie is very colorful and has great humor in parts. However, some of the coincidences in the movie like everyone meeting in Mauritius and landing at the same hotel are a bit of an exaggeration. Right around there, there&apos;s a song that seems totally unnecessary; so are a few other songs. No Entry title song is a great item number. The actresses all have done a fair job. Anil, Fardeen and Salman have done a good job as well. Overall I would give this one a 7. Could have been better with some more editing.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Opening Night&quot; released in 1977, tries to be an ambitious production. It succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character of theatre actress Myrtle is not necessarily someone we would love in real life. She is self-absorbed, often obnoxious, and makes life miserable for those around her - in other words, not unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the edge of collapse - we are not quite sure if the demons she is fighting are real or imagined, although we are let in on the secret early. Rowlands is obviously well directed with love by her gifted husband, actor/director John Cassavettes, who has a role in the film as well. This film is not without flaws - it is overly long, and the last part of the film where Myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seems almost cruel. The &quot;improvising&quot; in some of the dialogue - at least while on stage - goes on way too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially from Ben Gazarra, playing Myrtle&apos;s sleazy producer. Joan Blondell&apos;s character is never fully developed, and I never could figure out why she was in the film, except to placate Myrtle. See this film for Rowlands alone - she is fascinating throughout - and it is tough to take your eyes off her, although you will want to at times.",

      "reviewBody": "Right from the beginning I was lolling. That made it really uncomfortable because the rest of the people in the room were dead silent, and the embarrassment made me laugh even harder. Whether this movie warrants hyena-like laughter, I don&apos;t know. But it sure was an entertaining evening.\n\nThis movie has a quirky style that has to hit you just right for you to appreciate it. At times it borders on absurdist comedy (Airplane, Monty Python) but doesn&apos;t quite go all the way, instead striking a delicate balance between real &amp; ridiculous. For example, the movie opens at a restaurant that&apos;s so desolate, their only &quot;customer&quot; is a homeless guy getting a freebie. Outside, tumbleweeds blow by. Tumbleweeds in New York City, c&apos;mon that&apos;s hilarious! We soon realize that this film is very much tongue-in-cheek, and truly nothing is to be taken seriously. Though subtle, the movie is full of satire, like when a yuppie family walks into the restaurant in Spanish Harlem, and the yuppie mother says to the kid: &quot;you see, foreigners like to wear colorful things on their heads because they worship different gods.&quot;\n\nFunny stuff, I&apos;m tellin ya. And we haven&apos;t even gotten to the part where Danny Aiello makes his appearance as Joe the ruthless mafia boss who inexplicably breaks into song every 15 minutes. Each &amp; every character is so memorably wacky you gotta love em, from the gorgeous Nydia (Thalía) to her spastic father (Paul Rodriguez), and even the painfully repulsive mobster (perfectly played by Robert Costanzo) who becomes the center of a crazy, morbid scheme to attract business to the failing restaurant. If you go into this movie with the intent to laugh &amp; have a good time, I think you definitely will.",

The feel and looks of the comics are well realized in this live action film, situated in a kind of post- apocalyptic France.  Apart from the scenes situated on the moon, where the dictatorial Mac B&apos;ee family is ruling.  Their search for the former organ donor Tykho Moon, who himself is amnesiac after the first operation, to cure the family from a strange disease, provides the plotline. The actors are well chosen, matching the drawings of Bilal characters. Moreover they&apos;re top French actors.  I wish more American actors would sometimes choose to do more daring and interesting stuff. The decors and costumes were nice but a bit too obvious sometimes.  I did enjoy the icey blue teint covering it all though.  This depressing constant paleness in the sky contrasted with an image of the Eiffel Tower with the upper half cut off is just brilliant and still makes me smile thinking about it now. The film is capturing enough and the plot revealing enough till the end to also satisfy people who don&apos;t care for Bilal comics.  Pre-Amelie (if I may) Jeunet et Caro fans as well as people who like more bizarre French suspense like l&apos;Appartement should have a good time watching this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Marvelous film, an extension of the British kitchen-sink dramas from earlier in the decade (but with a friskier spirit), &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; introduced audiences to Vanessa Redgrave&apos;s kid sister, Lynn (in an Oscar-nominated performance). She&apos;s plain and frumpy Georgina, a too-tall, kissless clown and nursery school teacher who plays second-fiddle to her more beautiful flat-mate--and who also harbors a crush on her pal&apos;s sexy boyfriend in the bargain. While dodging the advances of her father&apos;s wealthy employer, Georgina acts as nursemaid to her pregnant roommate, never dreaming of the circumstances to follow. From Margaret Forster&apos;s novel, which she co-adapted with Peter Nichols, the film is visually alive, stylish and skittering about with &quot;free and easy&quot; abandon, yet with moral choices and a sobering heart at its center. Redgrave is nothing short of fabulous; her &quot;Georgy&quot; is often slumped over sulking, an easy mark with little sense of humor (she&apos;s either completely inflexible or terribly over-eager). The clever, enticing writing is spread about for everyone to share in--so much so that the supporting characters nearly upstage our heroine (whose moods tend to be exasperating near the end): Charlotte Rampling is excellent as pregnant Meredith (who gets the film&apos;s most viciously funny lines); Alan Bates is terrific as her devilish lover; while Oscar-nominated James Mason is too comfortably cast as the older man with an eye for Georgy (he isn&apos;t able to offer anything fresh here). Delightful comedy-drama from director Silvio Narizzano, one of the few from this era not to use &apos;mod&apos; touches to set the time and place. *** from ****",

In the English version, the character development was zilch. Be ware of the captioning as well - things like &quot;enjoyable&quot; in the audio become &quot;unpleasant&quot; (so the complete opposite of what the character is saying) in the captioning. You aren&apos;t drawn to the characters so you don&apos;t really care what happens to them. \n\nThe plot was okay but in no means fantastic. If you enjoyed movies like The Matrix and Sunshine (though without the science background in Sunshine) you might enjoy Cargo. Just make sure you watch it in the original German!"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;As Young as You Feel&quot; is a warm comedy set in a city somewhere not far from New York City. The year is 1951. World War II is well past, and the Korean conflict had not yet begun. (Korea wasn&apos;t properly called a War until years later.) America and the world were retooled and making goods for the consumer markets.\n\nThe Cold War hadn&apos;t really heated up yet between the Soviet Union and the West - it was just in the smoldering stages. That&apos;s the setting for this film, and it helps modern audiences decades later to appreciate the film. If one understands the time and the social climate, the gist of the story will make more sense.\n\nSo, here is a story about a widowed man who lives with his son&apos;s family. Monty Woolley plays Grandpa John Hodges. Son George is played by Allyn Joslyn and his daughter-in-law, Della, is played by Thelma Ritter. Granddaughter Alice is played by Jean Peters. Other key players fit in the story. David Wayne plays Joe Elliott, Alice&apos;s fiancé, who works at the same company where grandpa is employed - McKinley Printing.\n\nAlbert Dekker plays Louis McKinley, head of the printing company, and Constance Bennett plays his wife, Lucille. Minor Watson plays Harold P. Cleveland, the Chairman of the parent corporation that owns many others. And, Marilyn Monroe plays Harriet, secretary to McKinley. There are a number of other supporting cast who do a fine job.\n\nAs an aside - I laughed when I ordered and received the DVD of this film, because the cover artwork is just a huge photo of Marilyn Monroe. She has a very small part in this movie, and it&apos;s not bad. For once it isn&apos;t about flaunting her sex. But that the movie industry thinks it must flaunt such sex stars to attract customers and sell products says something of the minds of those people. If I had only the DVD design to go by, I wouldn&apos;t have been lured to buy the movie. But, the story and the characters appealed to me.\n\nThere aren&apos;t lots of clever or funny lines in this film. Rather, it&apos;s about a huge humorous situation. Grandpa John enjoys his work, the company, and his associates at work. He has no inclination for sitting around playing checkers or cards, or taking up hobbies in retirement. He&apos;s healthy and happy, and is a craftsman in the printing field. So, when he gets a notice of mandatory retirement when he reaches 65, he wants to challenge the company policy. But where does that policy come from. It&apos;s not from his employer but a parent corporation way up the ladder somewhere.\n\nWhen John finds out that no one knows what the chairman of the big corporation looks like, he devises a plan. Remember, this is 1951 when TV was just becoming a household staple. The names and photos of business heads weren&apos;t readily available on computers, cell phones, or methods as they are in the 21st century.\n\nAnd that&apos;s the set-up. The ensuing scenes make up the bulk of the story. The situational humor is wonderful. And, the film touches on drama in marital relations, social issues and the mores of the day. This isn&apos;t a great comedy or drama, but it is a warm, feel-good and enjoyable film about a slice of real American society of the time as one family might have lived t. All, but the comedic situation that John Hodges creates, that is.",

      "reviewBody": "I first noticed this film amongst the more popular Japanese films on Hulu, but I didn&apos;t pay much mind to it, cause I figured I could guess how it got there (being titled &quot;Edo Porn&quot; and all). But when I realized that this was a film by Kaneto Shindô (Onibaba, Kuroneko, The Naked Island), I couldn&apos;t pass up a chance to watch another one of his films.\n\nThis film is a portrait of the Japanese artist Hokusai, who I knew nothing about going in, but whom this film has piqued my interest in. He created the famous &quot;Great Wave off Kanagawa&quot;. Apparently, he also created what could probably be considered the earliest example of tentacle porn. The sequence in the film where he draws that is... amazing.\n\nThis film starts off a generally well-made, albeit somewhat odd biopic of an eccentric man. In the last act however... I can understand the criticisms. There&apos;s a lot of Hokusai and his friend stumbling around - the actors in unconvincing 90-year-old man makeup doing their best half-crazy half-senile old man impressions. There&apos;s a lot of Hokusai talking to himself about death. Things get really strange, but I have to admit, that&apos;s kind of what I love about this film.\n\nIn a strange way, I think this is a good companion film to Kenji Mizoguchi&apos;s &quot;Utamaro and His Five Women&quot;. That film is also about a famous Japanese woodblock printmaker of the same era, Utamaro, who is mentioned and briefly appears in &quot;Edo Porn&quot; as something of a rival of Hokusai. Made 35 years earlier, it&apos;s a completely different style of film, but, y&apos;know, they&apos;re completely different styles of artists.",

I couldn&apos;t believe that anyone would ever have made a film about such a character, who barely moves from his office.  Fortunately, he&apos;s got a nice yard to roam around in.  Not an action hero.\n\nWhat you&apos;ve got here is a play with snappy dialog brought to film with great stage actors.  And that&apos;s not bad at all.  The camera movement and sound are primitive (this is a 1929 film, after all) but you never lose interest. The filmmakers have wisely chosen to focus on one particularly pivotal incident in the history of the world:  a transfer in ownership of the right to construct and maintain the Suez Canal.  They focus on the key character in the drama: Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.  In the course of a few weeks when this drama takes place, we get to see what was appealing about this man, how he handled the prejudices against a Jew leading a country of Anglicans, and how his personal life was intertwined with his carrying out his mission.\n\nI have no idea how much of this is true.  I assume that the bare facts of the Suez Canal affair are accurate.  And this film brings to life the intrigue and romance of the life of a man at the central of English political life at a time when British power reached its zenith.\n\nA fine movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Code Name Wild Geese is one of those many movies that bases the plot around mercenary action in a jungle; actually, to be fair, given that every cheapo movie seems to have done that in the past few years, at least this was one of the first. (Is ANYONE really interested in mercenary-in-a-jungle movies?) Most of the action is perfunctory, predictable stuff. Lee Van Cleefe is wasted (as usual) in this; Lewis Collins does his hard man routine.\n\n This movie wouldn&apos;t really be worth commenting on except for the chase scene. It&apos;s absolutely hillarious! Collins&apos; character revs his car up in a tunnel when he realizes he&apos;s blocked in, and drives sideways, YES SIDEWAYS, along the wall of the tunnel! How does he do this? Well, aside from the fact that this is physically impossible, of course he doesn&apos;t... we&apos;re treated to a exquisitely appalling display of movie miniatures, intercut with grim expressions on Collin&apos;s face. It&apos;s priceless and worth the cost of a rental alone."

By its content, but also by the way it&apos;s presented.\n\nIn between the interviews you get to see shots that make the mood of this documentary just right for its content. A bird of prey, a toy soldier and tourists visiting old tunnels. Every shot is well balanced and fits right in.\n\nSince it is a documentary, its content is equally important as the way it is presented. And that&apos;s just the thing where this documentary stands out. You get to see people who liked being in Vietnam, people who don&apos;t want to go back because they can&apos;t kill people over there anymore. And every word is told honestly, without shame, pure and therefore exciting and alarming. \n\nFundamental questions about mankind rose on me after seeing this. Will people ever stop fighting wars when there are people who love every second off it? Is it wrong to love war? Would I be able to like it?\n\nThis documentary made me think and still does occasionally. Just see it and be surprised about mankind!\n\nTogether with &apos;The fog of war&apos; this documentary is a must-see for those who are interested in Vietnam.",

When I first saw the trailer for &apos;Black Snake Moan&apos; I laughed and thought, &quot;Great. Another &apos;Snakes on a Plane&apos; Samuel L Jackson movie&quot;. But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another. The story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and,yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to see &apos;Black Snake Moan&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "On the face of it, it seems a little much that a no doubt sexy guy will attract females like a magnet including three sisters, one of their brother&apos;s girlfriend - and the brother - but it could well happen I guess. That in essence is roughly the plot, so if that appeals you&apos;ll probably like the film - it&apos;s reasonably well cast, adequately acted, nicely filmed and moves along at a fast pace.  But if that plotline sounds too superficial, you can&apos;t stand seeing an E-type jaguar painted pale blue and aren&apos;t overly excited by Dublin as a setting, then you&apos;ll probably find it a bit ho hum. The promise of lots of appealing sex scenes will also be disappointing - certainly there is some action in that department but filmed very prudishly. However, Irish films are a rarity so that may be enough in itself to tempt a viewing."

      "reviewBody": "Director Raj Kanwar has directed many hit movies during the past two decades but Baadal (2000) is an underrated movie of him which was not successful commercially and not much talked about as well. I had seen this movie when it was released and found it much better than the hits given by Raj Kanwar (Deewaana, Laadla, Judaai etc.).\n\nBaadal (cloud) tells the story of an innocent child - Baadal (Bobby Deol) whose family members alongwith many other innocents were killed by a corrupt and cruel cop (Ashutosh Rana) under the pretext of eliminating the terrorists in the relevant campaigns going on in Punjab in 1984 . The terrorist (Ashish Vidyarthi) who was given shelter by Baadal&apos;s father (Alok Nath) saves him and fosters him. In his bid to seek his revenge from that cop, Baadal also gets involved in terrorist activities. Fate drags him to the house of a kind-hearted and right-thinking cop (Amrish Puri) whose wife (Neena Kulkarni) and daughters (Mayuri Kango and Sana Saeed) are also like him only but apprehensive of the looks of the stranger entering their house. Baadal whose heart is filled with anguish and hatred only, gets melted by the unexpected love of this kind family and the sympathetic and considerate attitude of the police officer giving refuge to him, gradually purifies heart. Besides, he gets the romantic love of a jovial girl (Rani Mukherjee) too. However, there is only one person in the world whom he cannot forgive and cannot cease to hate - the corrupt and cruel cop who had ruined his life. He has entered the top brass of the police system now (courtesy the flawed promotion-system in the Indian establishments, taking the non-deserving ones to the top). Finally, Baadal seeks his revenge from him and the fire of hatred in his heart gets splashes of water.\n\nThough Baadal has been made as a commercial movie filled with action, thrill, romance and the regular Bollywood formulae, by default perhaps, the screenplay is successful in rendering a strong message that all the terrorists are not bad by heart. Several of them are so because of the police atrocities leading to ruin of their lives. When the small kids are turned into orphans by the high-handed (and heartless) police (of India), isn&apos;t it natural that they take the wrong path alongside growing-up ? Love begets love and hatred begets hatred. The way, the shelter-giving family of Amrish Puri wins Baadal&apos;s hatred-filled heart with their love, kindness and sympathy wins the heart of the audience too. It has been portrayed in such a natural way that it&apos;s something to watch and feel only (my words may not be able to convey perfectly what the scenes have conveyed).\n\nThe movie is very interesting. It&apos;s more or less a formula movie in which action, thrill, comedy, romance, music, family ties; everything is there and that too in almost optimum quantum. Johnny Lever-Upasana Singh track is irritating but else the different sequences have been put at the right places. The songs are also skilfully inserted in the narrative. The twists in the tale do not allow any boredom to creep in and keep the viewer attentive. Rani Mukherjee provide relief moments in this serious movie through her romantic advances towards Bobby. There are many heart-winning scenes that leave long-lasting impact on the viewer, viz. Mayuri Kango&apos;s admitting Bobby as her brother, Neela Kulkarni&apos;s slapping Bobby under the misunderstanding that he has killed his little daughter but Bobby&apos;s taking it as a token of her love for him, Amrish Puri&apos;s logical outburst before his senior officer - Ashutosh Rana and finally Bobby&apos;s exhibition of his suppressed hatred for Ashutosh even when he is dead (in the ending scene of the movie).\n\nTechnically the movie is good. Both the action director and the choreographer (alongwith the art director as well) have done their jobs pretty well. The action and dance sequences are quite impressive. The sketting contest in college of Rani and Mayuri is also amusing. Production value is high.\n\nAnu Malik&apos;s music is good. The best song is the romantic duet of Kavita Krishnamoorthy and Sonu Nigam - Na Milo Humse Zyaada Kahin Pyar Ho Na Jaaye. Laal Garaara, Jugni Jugni, Tujhe Dekh Ke Dil Mera Dole and Yaara Yaara Mere Yaara Mere Yaaram are also good to listen (and to watch as well).\n\nBaadal is not only an underrated movie of Raj Kanwar but also of Bobby Deol. He has given an admirable performance in the title role. He has displayed the stuffiness, anguish and hatred embedded in the character through remarkable underplay. Rani Mukherjee has given such a performance in the role of a romantic and jovial girl that brings smile to the lips of the viewer. Late Amrish Puri has delivered a towering performance in the positive role and proved again that he was a class actor indeed. Ashutosh Rana as the villain is perfect. Neena Kulkarni, Mayuri Kango, Sana Saeed, Ashish Vidyarthi, Harish Patel, Kulbhushan Kharbanda (as Rani&apos;s father), Akash Khurana (as the right-thinking politician) etc. have done complete justice to their assigned roles. Only Johnny Lever irritates.\n\nThe hidden message of this apparently masala movie is that several (not all) terrorists (of tender age at least) can be brought back to the right path through understanding, sympathy and love. They may also be grief-filled in their hearts with nobody sharing their pain and tears. Terrorism cannot be eliminated merely by eliminating the terrorists without differentiating between the hardcore criminals and the aggrieved innocents joining the terrorist groups. And a strict vigil is required on the activities of the perverted cops too who vent out their personal frustration through cruelty on innocents in their so-called anti-terrorist compaigns and turn many innocents into new terrorists. I recommend this underrated movie to all the right-thinking Indians."

It is non sense either to see the president moving free everywhere in London or in UK. The idea of the plot was perhaps to denounce as many coups d&apos;etat Latin America has suffered and related problems of democracy there, but the arguments are too weak for the film to be qualified, at least, as an acceptable one.",

      "reviewBody": "Believe me RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART 2 took some swallowing but the opening ten minutes of RAMBO 3 caused me to fall out of my chair in shock . John Rambo does prize fighting to earn his keep in a Buddhist commune ! I mean that`s a bit like having a film where the hero`s an environmentalist who goes around blowing oil rigs to save the Alaskan wilderness . Oh wait a minute didn`t Steven Seagal ....\n\nDespite this incredible and vain attempt at character development there follows much dialogue that accurately reflects what is going on in Afghanistan in the mid 1980s . The Soviet - Afghan war actually intensified when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power and by that time over one million Afghans had died in the conflict while as many as five million had been forced over the border into Iran and Pakistan as what analysts at the time called &quot; Migratory genocide &quot; , a euphemism that people nowadays would describe as &quot; Ethnic cleansing &quot; . There`s other parts of the film that points out that screenwriter Sheldon Lettich has done his homework on the conflict with factual things like Soviet conscripts defecting to the Mujahedeen , of the red army planting mines and booby traps disguised as toys to blow off the limbs of children and of the Soviets use of chemical weapons which almost certainly proves that the sloppy script of FIRST BLOOD PART 2 was mainly down to James Cameron than Stallone , but as you`d expect in this type of action adventure movie the script rapidly degenerates into a series of set pieces of an all American superman blowing up a bunch of nasty commies who can`t shoot straight . Ah well at least the main commie isn`t played by a British actor unlike in the last film . Oh and congratulations to Peter McDonald for at least trying to make a Puma helicopter look like a Soviet helicopter gunship . The previous director was under the impression that the Soviets and Viet Cong use American Hueys \n\nSetting the record straight : A lot of people prove how ignorant they are of the Soviet - Afghan war by confusing the Mujahedeen with the Taliban . The Mujahedeen ( Translated &quot; The soldiers of God &quot; )  and the Taliban ( Translated &quot; The students of God &quot; ) are entirely seperate things . The Taliban were created in Pakistan in the early 1990s , took over Afghanistan in 1995 and were led by Mullah Omar . The Mujahedeen were split into several different groups and were led by different leaders ( None of them called Bin Laden ) most of them forming a coalition against the Taliban called the Northern Alliance in 1995/96 . Their overall leader was the legendary guerilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud who was murdered in a suicide bombing by Al Qai`da terrorists in September 2001 . It was the Northern Alliance who fought side by side with the Western coalition during their campaign to overthrow the Taliban government in 2001 to the present day",

      "reviewBody": "The first thing that comes to mind when sitting down and watching &quot;Robo-Geisha&quot; is probably: only in Japan! At least that is what rang true for me. This particular genre of movies is something that usually only rears its head from the bowels of Japan.\n\nAnd it takes a certain kind of mindset to be able to fully appreciate these particular types of movies. I enjoy them for the campy, cheesy over-the-top entertainment that they are. Don&apos;t put too much into them, because they are not really meant to be taken seriously.\n\nThe story is about two sisters, one being a Geisha and the other living in the shadow of her Geisha sister. When they are both recruited by the Kageno steel company, a rivalry develops between the sisters in order to prove to be the better Geisha warrior/assassin. The Geisha women are trained to be deadly killers and are enhanced with robotic parts. But there is a sinister secret stirring beneath the surface of the Kageno company.\n\nYes, it is bizarre and odd, but still fun and entertaining for the campy movie that it is. Sure, this is somewhat of an acquired taste, and as such the movie will not prove appealing to every viewer. Mind you that this is not Shakespearian thespian acting in the least bit. You know what you get here, and &quot;Robo-Geisha&quot; delivers exactly on that account.\n\nThe acting in &quot;Robo-Geisha&quot; is as to be expected for a movie such as this. Personally, then I found it to actually be adequate acting for the genre. So that was a good thing.\n\nHowever, the overall movie experience is a mediocre one. The movie fails to really impress in comparison to many others of this particular odd genre. And as such, then the movie failed to rise above the mediocre waterline. I am rating &quot;Robo-Geisha&quot; a mere five out of ten stars.\n\nThere are far better choices to pick from if you enjoy this particular genre of Japanese movies.",

      "reviewBody": "Claude Chabrol started as part of the nouvelle vague,as contemporary of Truffaut and -yuk!- Godard ,but his roots are in the old cinema,that of Clouzot and Duvivier.That&apos;s why his best movies hold up very well today.\n\nA first golden era included such works as &quot;à double tour&quot; &quot;le beau Serge&quot; and &quot;les cousins&quot;.Then came a period of barren inspiration which ended with &quot;les biches&quot; (1967) with which Chabrol entered his most fruitful period the 1967-1973 era:at least five of the works of this time are first-rate works :&quot;la femme infidel&quot; (1968;dubious American remake);&quot;the beast must die&quot; (1969) ;&quot;the butcher&quot; (1969) his towering achievement;&quot;la rupture&quot;(1970) his most underrated ;&quot;juste avant la nuit&quot; (1971) and finally &quot;les noces rouges&quot; which seems today as the last hurrah,a farewell to a golden era.\n\nUnlike the four other films I mention &quot;les noces rouges&quot; is based on a true story which was widely talked about in France of the early seventies.But ,true or not,Chabrol&apos;s touch is strong and he makes the story a chabrolesque plot to the core.The bourgeois whom Chabrol depicted in &quot;la femme infidel&quot; or &quot;la rupture&quot; ,and who was played by Michel Bouquet has turned into a caricature.Enter Claude Piéplu,and with his high-pitched voice,he almost overshadows the excellent Stephane Audran and Michel Piccoli.An impotent self-satisfied mean bourgeois with political ambitions ,he accepts his wife&apos;s(Audran) affair with his deputy mayor(Piccoli) ,more,it&apos;s fine with him because it will be useful for his shady business.The scene when he tells the lovers so is incredible;lines such as &quot;I want everybody to be happy around me!&quot; he delivers to a stunned Piccoli and a bewildered Audran give goose pimples.\n\nYou will notice the omnipresence of water:in &quot;que la Bete meure&quot; and &quot;le boucher&quot; ,it symbolized a return from hell,not necessarily a happy end but a world with some peace of mind.In &quot;les noces rouges&quot; it appears during the love scenes (played by the two actors with more gusto than usual :never in a Chabrol movie the carnal act had been -and will be-so much to the fore)as a symbol of innocence (after all, the two people have no sex with their legal partners)in the sin.But it&apos;s the heroine&apos;s daughter ,called Helene ,who epitomizes innocence and some kind of deus ex machina.\n\nWhat&apos;s more puzzling is that Stephane Audran&apos;s characters were all called Hélène in the four other movies I mention:in &quot;la femme infidel&apos; Helene had a lover but with some excuse :her husband appeared like a washout sexually;in &quot;le boucher&quot; she was a brave schoolteacher ,purity flesh on the bone;in &quot;la rupture&quot; her character had to fight against a hostile bourgeois world .In &quot;les noces rouges&quot; Audran ,called Lucienne,is on the other side of the mirror:she really becomes a criminal,almost in a dream .When her daughter,Hélène,who took the place she occupied in former movies asks her &quot;I want you to be happy,mom,please tell me the truth&quot; Audran does not seem to realize all that means.And when she does,it will be too late.\n\nLes noces rouges&quot; is also a movie which depicts political life circa 1970 in a small town where gossips run rampant.And as usual,Chabrol is marvelous when it comes to painting vignettes of ordinary life -see the scene in the library-\n\nIt would take Chabrol five years to muster this sort of command (&quot;Violette Nozieres&quot; (1978)),and although he has occasionally made great works (&quot;l&apos;enfer&quot; &quot; la cérémonie&quot; ),he will be remembered in fifty years or so for those gems of the late sixties/early seventies era.&quot;Les noces rouges&quot; is a must.",

The film is basically a parable of her fortitude and the adversity she faces, with inspiring gestures of solidarity and thought-provoking elements of strife--even her enemies are sympathetic in the sense that they, too, struggle with poverty. This would be a wonderful film to show to children for discussion.",

      "reviewBody": "Once upon a time, economics dictated that porn could be filmed on relatively big budgets, as witness the pinnacles of that phenomenon, Bob Guccione&apos;s &quot;Caligula&quot; and the digital playground team&apos;s pair of &quot;Pirates&quot; movies. Now with porn free and streaming such foolhardy epics no longer make sense, but Antonio Adamo&apos;s &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was made under the wire and is carried by its decent production values.\n\nNot so its sequel &quot;Cleopatra II&quot; -see my separate review of that disaster. But the first part of the story is both sexy and visually arresting, no mean feat.\n\nUnlike the current set of industry hacks, Adamo doesn&apos;t dishonestly claim as parody the practice of ripping off mainstream hits, but rather does his own relatively serious (I don&apos;t recall any comedy content in his many features) takes on popular subjects, as notably in his breakthrough string of &quot;Gladiator&quot; movies in the wake of Ridley Scott.\n\nThis riff on Cleopatra and ancient Rome, a subject he would return to with a bang in his &quot;Roma&quot; trilogy. owes a lot to another top director&apos;s epic, James Cameron&apos;s &quot;Titanic&quot;. The connection is that Adamo frames his story of the romances of the Queen of the Nile in a modern-day framework, giving much of the footage over to a team of grave-robbers intent on cloning a 21st Century Cleo from the mummy&apos;s DNA. Cameron&apos;s framing his romance within the hunt for the ship at the bottom of the sea went a long way toward making his movie so successful.\n\nJulia Taylor, in very fake-looking black wig, is an odd chase for the title role, but her humping ability more than makes up for any perceived miscasting. Male cast is relatively lame, but the other prominent femmes including Sandra Russo and Rita Faltoyano are great eye candy. Dutch actress Bobbi Eden as the sort of Lara Croft character in the modern day footage is unconvincing, upstaged by her boss, Laura Angel, a perfect villainess.\n\nLocation shooting in Cairo and Luxor, Egypt is extremely impressive given limited schedules and the only drawback is Adamo&apos;s using video rather than film for lensing. All told, the acting and the sci-fi oriented cloning storyline keeps one&apos;s interest, rather than getting in the way in our &quot;cut to the chase&quot; all-sex-all-the- time culture.\n\nToo bad the cliffhanger ending saga gives way to a completely disappointing sloppy seconds sequel."

      "reviewBody": "Never before (and after) a movie on French Resistance has been so &quot;glamourless&quot;. Jean-Pierre Melville has been hailed as the father of the French gangster film. Certainly, his gangster films are probably the films for which he is best known (Le Doulos, Deuxieme Soufflé, Le Samourai, Le cercle rouge, Bob le flambeur) on par if not better than anything which Hollywood produced. Yet the world of the anonymous gun-toting hoodlum occupies only a part of his oeuvre.\n\n&apos;L&apos;armee des ombres&apos; (aka The Shadow Army) is Jean Pierre Melville 1969 masterpiece and does not deal with gangsters. The film is a mix of the director&apos;s war time experiences in the French Resistance and Joseph Kessel successful wartime novel. What is remarkable about this film is that Melville turned a mosaic of anecdotes that Kessel&apos;s novel is all about into a great, dark epic.\n\nFrom the chilling opening shot of Germans marching down the Champs-Elysées to the final scene involving the fellow Resistant Mathilde (the great Simone Signoret) the film seems to demonstrate that fighting for an ideal often leads towards death and solitude. What Melville does successfully is to show those dead-ends the way they occur to their protagonist (very simply and minimalist), however more than showing them Mr. Melville managed to make these realities (death and solitude) an equally tragic experienced for the audience...\n\n&apos;L&apos;armee des ombres&apos; is Melville&apos;s most moving film, a monument to the spirit of the Resistance rather than its actuality. A poignant drama with a strong performance from not only Lino Ventura but also Simone Signoret, Paul Meurisse, Jean Pierre Cassel, Claude Mann, Paul Crauchet to name a few.\n\nThis is probably Melville&apos;s greatest cinematographic achievement and, when fiction becomes reality, when actors leave behind their egos to resurrect into heroes, when the colors of the film mirror the one of the soul and when silence becomes music, true cinema has been achieved &apos;L&apos;armee des ombres&apos; is a terrible yet powerful experience in which the words duty, courage, abnegation get charged with meaning",

Sadly, several seconds later, my hopes were dashed when the names of Richard Pepin and Joseph Merhi (the honchos of PM Entertainment) were not listed in the credits. They were the driving force behind those great action flicks, and without them, what we have here is an extremely mediocre movie at its best, and a painfully predictable and flat movie at its worst. You&apos;ll be saying, &quot;I&apos;ve seen this before&quot; throughout, even if you can&apos;t remember where you&apos;ve seen it before. Dean Cain makes for a one-note hero, and none of the other performances are memorable as well. I guess some of the fire effects aren&apos;t bad for a low budget movie, but you can&apos;t make a good movie simply with good special effects. If it&apos;s raining outside and this is playing on TV, you&apos;d be more entertained going outside and being soaked."

And Jonathan trying to fit in with the monsters by turning himself into one and a few others into humans. Sadly, the plot is boring. The script is lazy. The humor is unfunny. Sure kids will love it. Adults may want to take a pass on this one. The animation is eh.",

Jack is sent by his agency to stop them and arrives on Earth in his daughter&apos;s body. Can Jack save the world and his daughter&apos;s life from the new Trancers? This movie is directed by Jay Woelfel (Closed for the Season) and stars Zette Sullivan (Sexual Intrigue), Robert Donavan (Art of the Dead), Timothy Prindle (Shades of Darkness) and Jennifer Cantrell (Lingerie Bowl). This movie is pretty awful. The storyline is atrocious, as is the CGI, fight scenes, choreography, running or any other action related sequence. There are some entertaining elements like a woman pretending to be Jack, the Trancers makeup and some pretty good one-liners but not enough to salvage the bad. This is a below average addition to the genre and was a good place to end the series. I&apos;d score this a 3.5-4/10 and recommend skipping it.",

The biggest liability is Lorraine Bracco&apos;s vacuous, unconvincing femme fatale; James Belushi is equally miscast as the town stud, though he has some good moments near the end. The best things about the movie are the lush, jazzy music score, and some nice panoramic views of Palm Beach. ** out of 4.",

If you&apos;re going in here expecting the classic SpongeBob shenanigans you&apos;re going to get that. It&apos;s the human stuff that sucked. It was cheap, low quality, poorly written, and even cringe inducing. For a SpongeBob movie, you need to focus on your main characters. I did however like the Cheeks family. The writing just wasn&apos;t good. I just don&apos;t think SpongeBob and humans mix well.

      "name": "Another fine movie by Jiri Menzel",
      "reviewBody": "My review was written in May 1986 after a Cannes Film Festival Market screening.\n\n&quot;My Sweet Little Village&quot; finds director Jiri Menzel in the warm winning form of his &quot;Capricious Summer&quot; as well as other more recent of his pictures such as &quot;Cutting It Short&quot;. This comedy about small-town life in Czechoslovakia is a modest but very entertaining opus, and elicited a rarely heard ovation at its conclusion upon screening in one of the smaller salles in the Cannes market.\n\nSimple story emphasizes situation comedy and running gags as bumbling young Otik, thought by his friends and neighbors to be mentally retrded, is rejected by his older workmate, Mr. Pavel, on delivery jobs. Pavel is not the only one tired of Otik, as an influential type is working on getting the boy transferred to a job in Prague so his local house can be lucratively modernized and resold, complete with an &quot;English garden&quot;.\n\nThere are all sorts of goofy local intrigues, such as the young married woman who is always conspiring to get Otik out of his house (one time he is sent off to catch a &quot;must-see&quot; Romanian film) so she can dally there undetected with her young boyfriend. The town doctor (Rudolf Hrusinsky) is forever crashing his car into almost everything in its path, and though he is sympathetic, he is given to talking his patients out of their symptoms rather than prescribing any treatment.\n\nUsing a lowkey, simple style that perfectly snatches the rural setting and unsophisticated characters. Menzel very warmly coaxes humor out of familiar material. Some of his running gags are priceless and no matter what happens, including inevitable physical violence (as in the cuckolded husband&apos;s reaction), there is no hint of malie here. Menzel very gently pokes fun at the provincialism of his countrymen, in a universal way, as when two guy discuss how the bra-less look has caught on in the West -and how glad they are it has spread as far as their village.\n\nCast is uniformly excellent as an ensemble, with stalwart Rudolf Hrusinsky particularly delicious as the doctor."

      "reviewBody": "Brilliant surgeon Dr. Gogol is infatuated with Horror Theatre star Yvonne Orlac. After meeting her in person and realising that she only has eyes for her husband, the renowned pianist Stephen Orlac, he buys a life size mannequin of her and dreams of doing what Pygmalion did with Galatea. When Stephen is involved in an horrific train crash and has both his hands crushed beyond healing, Yvonne pleads with Gogol to help save his well being, he does, by amputating the crushed hands and grafting on the hands of a recently executed murderer, a murderer whose speciality was knives!\n\nMad Love is one of those amazingly old classics that is a hybrid of genre staples. At times it&apos;s surrealist and at others it&apos;s operating via a Grand Guginol pulse, whilst knowingly it laces the story with an uneasy comedic bent. Boasting camera work from Gregg Toland and Chester Lyons and directed by the impressive Karl Freund, this adaptation of Maurice Renard&apos;s novel is a chillingly memorable piece of work. Working off a plot that sees the bad Doctor driven by lustations rather than out and out insanity, Freund revels in slowly winding the coil until the spring that is Peter Lorre (Gogol) explodes (implodes), cloaking various scenes in telling shadows that themselves become integral to the plot. Peter Lorre is of course in his element, demented yet sympathetic, it&apos;s real hard to take your eyes away from his magnetic weirdness. Colin Clive as Stephen Orlac also puts in a performance of note, all twitchy nervousness and believable emotional torment, whilst Frances Drake more than adequately brings vulnerability to the centrifugal importance of Yvonne&apos;s emotional turmoil.\n\nWeird and gorgeous, and incredibly well written, Mad Love holds up very well today as a horror/romance film of vast influential worth. So see it in the dark and marvel at its various moments of cinematic excellence. 8.5/10",

Video boom was on and this was off. Yes, this is what the Government film office was funding in its production arm for &apos;all the family&apos;. A great cast of Aussie favorites including the fantastic Ruth Cracknell and lovely young Claudia Karvan (DATING THE ENEMY) helped MOLLY limp along at the school holiday box office. There is a lot of sideshow music from Mick Conway and rattly piano and mouthorgan music with Molly herself yelping away with gusto. The title of the film is terrible and people didn&apos;t want to pay much to see it. The State film office folded a few years later and MOLLY disappeared along with it. Since then we made NAPOLEON the wandering puppy and PAWS the dog that can use a computer. MOLLY is a good kids pic and a DVD release would work well. The cast of humans especially will get it a good profile.",

      "reviewBody": "After the huge success in recent years of the Ring movies and Dark Water, i was looking forward to watch this movie as I&apos;ve become a big fan of those aforementioned films. Chaos though is not a horror, and is instead a taut thriller surrounding a kidnapping of a women by a young man which is not what it seems (which is what the &quot;Chaos&quot; title is referring to).\n\nAs expected from the director, as per his other movies, the direction and camera work is excellent, and the female lead is the main gist of the movie, haunting the viewer and being the centre-point of the action. The female lead is excellent but is well complimented by her male colleagues in the film.\n\nThe main drawback is though that the script simply is not as intriguing as the filmmakers believe it is, and to be quite honest, it can be very predictable. Twists and turns keep your attention, and you will enjoy it, but i find the movie was a lost opportunity for something stronger. It is not a disappointment, but the director here has produced something below his high standards.\n\nOverall, a fair thriller which most will enjoy, just don&apos;t expect something to keep you thinking and talking for days on end like some of his other films.",

      "reviewBody": "The Cheaters (also known as The Castaway0 is something of an unknown Christmas movie to the younger cinephile. Or perhaps because it came out of the low-budget Republic Pictures? It&apos;s simply just a forgotten one. So much so you will be hard pushed to see it mentioned on any Christmas film lists that flourish around the yuletide season. The film is based around an original story written by Frances Hyland and Albert Ray and concerns a sophisticated family inviting a washed up actor to their home for Christmas. As things progress we learn that this family are using the holiday season to secure a rich uncle&apos;s inheritance, but naturally all is not going to be plain sailing. \n\nHeading the cast list is Joseph Schildkraut (The Shop Around the Corner), Billie Burke (The Wizard of Oz) and Eugene Palette (The Ghost Goes West). It&apos;s directed by Republic house jobber Joseph Kane, with photography and scoring coming from Reggie Lanning &amp; Walter Scharf respectively. \n\nSo is the film any good though? Well it&apos;s safe to say that anyone looking for another old Christmas movie to boost the crimble spirit can safely add this one to their rota. It&apos;s very much in the mold of the likes of The Bishops Wife, which of course is no bad thing at all as a point of reference. My chief irk with the picture is that it flatters to deceive. By the midpoint the film has all options open to it, even threatening to be darker and perhaps leaning towards an ending of some surprise. But sadly, and without me crying out for any Pottersville type misery here, the film reverts to type and settles for a warm mince pie and a glass of mulled wine. Again, that&apos;s no bad thing at the season we choose to watch it in, but really it promised to be something more. \n\nStill, it&apos;s a comfortable recommendation for the heart warming seeker. 6/10",

But even without the facial hair, he still looked pretty untrustworthy to me, let alone as a romantic lead.\n\nNaturally, his wanted poster catches up with him (since he did not even change his name). The soundtrack is unbelievably loud and dramatic, especially during some &apos;exciting&apos; mountain high jinx. So he returns home, just in time to see the murder case resolved neatly by a very contrived plot twist. We finally catch up with his by now forgotten wife and it turns out she has a suitor too, but of course women in films are not allowed the same liberties as men when it comes to infidelity. \n\n3 out of 10"

But I have seen some on both sides of this in terms of engagement.\n\nYou should know that these are first essays on the nature of reality and fiction in fiction. Only as a second matter are muscle and concurrent elaboration added. Ruiz isn&apos;t interested to go as far as, say &quot;2001&quot; (or for that matter &quot;2046&quot;) in taking the armature of narrative shuffling and make us care.\n\nSo, as a friend says, you can see the plumbing. In fact, it is little but plumbing, more like &quot;The Hyposthesis of the Stolen painting&quot; where every element was there only to drive the metanarrative with the narrative itself almost mute.\n\nNot so in &quot;Comedy of Innocence&quot; or &quot;Time Regained&quot; where he makes the narrative obvious. With the former, we actually care about Huppert&apos;s character. Here, the central character is a Go board, where (if you watch closely) the patterns of what surrounds what change in subtle ways. This is the partner in a sense to &quot;Hero&quot; which is cast as a game of Go in the rain. But we forget.\n\nIf you choose to see this, dear friends, choose to approach it as an exposition, elaboration or fold on one of your favorite already layered projects. Because though it has a Latin engine, it wears a French straitjacket.\n\nThe notion here is that the story captures the person and changes her, not the other way around. So if you want to know anyone, you need to know the genealogy of their story. In watching this, the characters are attached to stories, not to bodies. So several characters have more than one body and the other way around.\n\nEvery single woman in the thing is one woman: all are redheads except the second being of Deneuve&apos;s making, who only differs in being blond. She (the blond) is our designated detective. The film merges with paintings, tableaux, games, courtships, therapies, rituals, and at least one ancient campfire tale.\n\nFor me, this was the other side of the warring narrators in &quot;2001&quot; with which I suggest you view it.\n\nTed&apos;s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

      "reviewBody": "Version: Columbia/Tristar DVD, Cantonese with English subtitles\n\nA somewhat different offering from Jackie Chan in &apos;Gorgeous&apos;. Bu (Shu Qi) is bored in Taiwan, and after reading a message in a bottle, she goes to Hong Kong to search out a mysterious stranger (Tony Leung), who turn out to be not be exactly what she expected. Eventually she meets C.N. Chan (Jackie) and grows close to him. Meanwhile, Bu&apos;s fiancée is looking for her and Jackie has troubles with Lo (Emil Chau), a childhood friend and now business rival.\n\nI have to admit that I enjoyed this, even though romantic-comedies aren&apos;t really my thing. It isn&apos;t your usual Jackie Chan-style, but if he wants to try something different, then I will gladly support him. I found &apos;Gorgeous&apos; funny, although others will disagree. There isn&apos;t much action, but when there is, it is excellent. The two fight scenes with Brad Allan are some of the best fight-scenes Jackie has ever filmed. They really are incredible, but in the end, this really is more of a &apos;feel good&apos; movie than anything else.\n\nApparently the version I have is cut by 20 minutes, missing a cameo Stephen Chow. Damn. Stephen Chow is cool. \n\n&apos;Gorgeous&apos; isn&apos;t for everyone - fans of the Chan-man should check it out, but I&apos;m not guaranteeing you&apos;ll enjoy it as much I did. 7/10",

      "name": "Fourth Dirty Harry entry changes the formula to a darker, character-driven style.... interesting but not wholly successful.",
      "reviewBody": "Sudden Impact is the most unusual of the five Dirty Harry movies, but that doesn&apos;t make it the best. However, after the rather flat and comic-book heroics of the third film, The Enforcer, it&apos;s good to see some changes to the formula. Sudden Impact is quite a dark, moody piece of cinema with big emphasis on character. Yes, there&apos;s action, but the action in this one is only one piece of the jigsaw whereas in some of the other Dirty Harry outings the action was everything.\n\n Harry Callahan (Eastwood) is in hot water with his superiors for carrying out an illegal search on a suspicious car. The young thugs he arrested are released because of the lack of evidence, and they set out to take revenge on Harry. However, Harry is a tough nut to crack - and pretty soon he is striking back in his own destructive style. Harry&apos;s boss decides to get Harry out of town for a while to avoid further bloodshed, so he assigns him to a quiet murder investigation in an isolated coastal town. Harry pieces together the mystery and discovers that the killer is a female artist (Locke) who is bumping off a bunch of drop-outs who gang-raped her and her sister years previously. Should he arrest her for the killings, or should he turn a blind eye and let her do away with these repellent scum-bags?\n\n The film is probably the second best in the series (the original is always going to be considered the best). Peculiarly, it is the only Dirty Harry movie upon which Eastwood also doubled up as director. It isn&apos;t a whole success, with some needless scenes (what&apos;s the point of the sequence detailing the hold-up of a coffee shop?) and a couple of overly hammy performances by the main villains (especially the trailer trash redhead). On the whole, though, this is a very interesting and unusual addition to the series which gets by on the strength of being totally different to all the other four episodes."

Yeah, they are cheesy and sometimes horrible, but they are still fun. When I watch a Roger Corman movie I know not to expect Lord of the Rings or the Godfather. I mean come on it&apos;s Concorde. Believe it or not there is a market for this or they wouldn&apos;t be hear. I mean dude Carnasour, Rapter, Deadly Outbreak, Cybervengence, The Outsider (which is basically a cheap straight to video remake of Westworld) When you hear the midi music that should really clue you in this is going to be a b-film.

In this case, the paradigm is &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; -- a film that belongs to a totally different genre, was written and shot according to &quot;naturalistic&quot; procedures of Hollywood commercial cinema and, most of all, deals with romance from a quite different perspective. In &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; redemption of homoeroticism comes through death, a strategy that was quite revealing of the morals that prevailed at the time the movie was produced. &quot;Happy Together&quot;, on the other hand, deals with romance as if it could have been homo-, hetero- or whatever, and even though homoeroticism is such an essential element to the narrative, the protagonists&apos;love affair is a pretext for the emergence of their decentered identities, their search for love and friendship and, most important, it ends on a note of hope of future encounters. All that in a poetic tone, one that demands a continuous esthetic reconstruction, hardly understood (or accepted) by those who are encapsulated in a world of conventional filmmaking."

It tells the story of an elderly woman (Fernanda Montenegro) who lives alone and works for the police by reporting crimes she sees when she goes out or looks out the window. One night, she sees what appears to be a murder on the apartment across the street (somewhat hitchcocky, this part). A man (Raul Cortez) gives his wife an injection and she dies. The police doesn&apos;t listen to her, so she has to go find out the truth by herself. That&apos;s when the beautiful and enchanting love story begins. This woman falls in love with the suspect (who&apos;s also an elderly man) and finds out that it&apos;s never too late to live a love story again.\n\nIt shows that even if you think you&apos;re the loneliest person alive, and have no hope, someone will be there waiting for you. no matter how old you are.\n\n This movie really makes me proud. It shows sex, but in a beautiful way. It shows violence, but in a real-but-not-too-shocking way... it&apos;s about loneliness, hope, and of course, love!\n\nFernanda Montenegro and Raul Cortez have an incredibly wonderful chemestry, they&apos;re both marvelous actors, and did a great job... and so did the director Marcos Berstein. The photography (cinematography?) is also wonderful. One of the best brazilian movies ever, for sure. a MUST-SEE! 9 out of 10!",

I laughed at literally every scene, I don&apos;t know how they managed to make a simple thing like the hero typing an email funny but they did.\n\nThe first thing you notice about the movie is the shark is either shown as shark footage (which is fair enough) or something that looks like it was made in Microsoft paint. I&apos;m guessing bad actors are drawn to bad scripts like sharks to chum and this chum is especially fishy. Witness the security guard who just has to say a couple of simple lines but is quite clearly reading from a cue card he can&apos;t quite see. Most movies would cut him out, especially as the scene is pointless.\n\nI also especially liked the helicopter pilot, if a man doesn&apos;t twitch a muscle at the sight of a 100ft shark then it&apos;s hard to imagine anything in life really moving him. Maybe he&apos;s just feeling down because his helicopter is quite clearly a toy or maybe he&apos;s just bemused because the shark grunts like a pig throughout the film.\n\nThe best scene doesn&apos;t involve the shark at all. They&apos;re stood on the beach and our hero delivers one of the worst lines ever written. If you&apos;ve seen the movie you know the one, if not then you have the right to discover the beauty of it yourself. \n\nProbably the funniest film ever made, no bad movie shelf is complete without it. Fingers crossed they make another one with the exact same cast and writer."

It seems that Rob Schneider has matured. He tackles serious subjects (prison system) in a fun way. Some of the jokes have been done to death and can be tiresome. But because of Schneider&apos;s performance they still are acceptable. Of course you don&apos;t have to expect this movie to have any social or political impact. I just want to mention that it is big step up for Schneider in comparison to &quot;The Animal&quot; or &quot;Deuce Bigalow&quot;. David Carradine clearly has gotten very old but still can deliver. Especially in this movie. Since he is parodying himself. He is making fun of the character he played in &quot;Kung Fu&quot; but at the same time embracing and honouring the role that brought him fame. Worth watching!",

      "name": "The distant thunder of an unknown war, its tragic affect on rural India, and the development of a man&apos;s sense of his social responsibility",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;Ashani Sanket&quot;, or &quot;Distant Thunder&quot;, is one of the first color films of Satyajit Ray (probably my favorite film maker).  It is a story about a young Brahmin couple, Gangacharan Chakravarti (played by Soumitra Chatterjee) and his wife Ananga (played by the simply named Babita), who come to settle in a rural and largely illiterate peasant community in India&apos;s eastern province of Bengal.  Gangacharan takes up teaching and the occasional priestly duties, disparaging the backwardness of the people he is serving.\n\nThere are several scenes of military aircraft flying in formation; the villagers wonder how they can fly and remark at their beauty.  But the planes are flying because of their participation in WWII, and soon people start hearing that their (British) king is at war, and food shortages are causing their rice prices to increase from 6 (presumably rupees per kilogram?) to 8.  The price skyrockets to 10, 11, 12, ... and gets to over 30.\n\nThe historical background is a seemingly forgotten Holocaust, the Great Bengal famine of 1943.  The British callously disregarded and even facilitated the starvation deaths of 3-5 million people in rural Bengal. While ironically India was very significantly supporting the British war effort with over 3 million troops (after again being denied independence after its WWI support), Winston Churchill exported food from India that was desparately needed domestically, and even barred other countries who were ready to send aid to India from doing so.  This after a series of famines under the British Raj, such as one in 1770 that decimated 1/3 of Bengal&apos;s population - 10 million people - and that was compounded by the greed of the East India Company.\n\nAs hunger affects all, including Ananga and Gangacharan, and some to the point of starvation, Gangacharan is shamed to realize that the relatively luxurious life they had led was at the expense of the landless peasants. &quot;Ashani Sanket&quot; is a portrayal of the horrors inflicted on rural Bengal by the wartime famine, and of Gangacharan&apos;s new questioning of caste restrictions and privileges, as well as the selfless sacrifices others less fortunate than he willingly make for him, as a hardly understood conflict goes on as distant thunder.\n\nI would recommend the film as a poignant but by no means maudlin historical drama.  Technically, I think the film would have been more powerful in black and white - but that could just be because it is difficult to watch a Ray film and not compare it to his famous Apu trilogy or &quot;Home and the World&quot;, with the stark reality of lower middle class life that the films&apos; medium displays.  I finished watching the film minutes ago on video and leave with the impression that it&apos;s by no means my favorite Ray film, but, like everything by him I&apos;ve seen, worth seeing.\n\n--Dilip 10/28/2001"

The film could not decided if it was going to remain a mystery or a supernatural thriller. Unfortunately, by the time the credits rolled, I really didn&apos;t care.\n\nThere are several different sub-plots traveling straight together in the first half of the film. Tony Leung Ka Fai plays a cop failing to cope with the attempted murder of his daughter and the suicide of a corrupt fellow officer he helped bring to justice. His daughter won&apos;t speak and his neglected wife is seeking a divorce. Amid the murders, Leung Ka Fai learns that a FBI agent specializing in behavioral science and assigned to work with him, has been summoned by his superiors for show. One of his fellow detectives alludes to this and that the government might have a malevolent purpose behind this. The investigation points towards supernatural forces, and we are led into a temple where we witness a murder take place in the midst of what appears to be a Taiwanese Satanic ceremony.\n\nAll this flies straight together, but then each veers off in a separate direction, and in order to make sense and keep up with the story line, the viewer needs &quot;double vision.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "Wow, where has this little flick been? The Little Girl who Lives Down the Lane is an intriguing mystery, an intense character portrait and a dark, brooding thriller all rolled into one rather odd little package - and on a personal note, I liked it a lot! The film has gained some notoriety (although not as much as it would have if it was more seen) for the scene involving a thirteen year old Jodie Foster undressing - but that never offsets the point of the film, and besides that; it&apos;s hardly like the scene has just been thrown in to satisfy the perverts in the audience. Furthermore, the most shocking scene in the film involves a hamster with no naked teenage girl present! Anyway, The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is about a young girl, living down a quiet lane with her poet father. Only nobody has ever this man, and it isn&apos;t long before nosey neighbours - such as the perverted Frank Hallet and his enquiring, power mad mother comes sniffing round, eager to upset her life. She&apos;s not quick to let them know the truth, however, and along with her boyfriend; a crippled young magician from the neighbourhood, she is forced to take steps to preserve her independence.\n\nThe most obvious theme running through the film stems from loneliness, and how being brought up on your own will ultimately leave you a different person to if things such as schools are allowed to take charge. This is interesting; as it preaches the idea of social conditioning makes up the person more than most like to admit. The film is often touted as being a horror, but this is incorrect. While the film does feature several macabre instances, and a foreboding and mysterious atmosphere that is present throughout the run time; there&apos;s very little in the way of actual horror. The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is much more of a drama-come-mystery than a horror film. The film is probably most notable for it&apos;s lead performance. Jodie Foster had already impressed in 1976 with her role in Martin Scorsese&apos;s hit film, Taxi Driver - but here she is far better. Despite her young age, Foster commands the screen and despite being a child, her maturity and acting talent shine through to make this a more complete performance than most actresses manage in a lifetime.\n\nOn the whole, this film was once hard to come by; but with the new DVD currently doing the rounds, the film should be seen by everyone. The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane fits snugly alongside the rest of the classics of the seventies, and the fact that it has only just resurfaced is one of cinema&apos;s biggest injustices. Highly recommended viewing!",

      "name": "Fassbinder&apos;s darkest and most punishing examination of personal exploitation",
      "reviewBody": "Many, if not all of Fassbinder&apos;s films focus on weighty, emotional issues and characters plunged into personal despair, but none more so than the torturous and overpowering melodrama of In a Year of 13 Moons (1978). Here, Fassbinder created a film that is completely miserable in both tone and content from the first frame until the last; with the director taking the personal loss over the suicide of his lover Armin Meier and turning it into a suffocating chamber piece of pain and humiliation. Like his earlier masterpiece, Fox and his Friends (1975), the film focuses on the personal exploitation and persecution of a sensitive character at the hands of the people that he loves, as he finds himself cast against a cruel backdrop of the grimy and oppressive homosexual sub-culture of 1970&apos;s Frankfurt. However, unlike Fox and his Friends, the spirit of Meier&apos;s death and the guilt that we assume Fassbinder was suffering from at the time of the film&apos;s conception have here removed any prevailing notion of hope or the promise of escape that hung-over the character of Franz - the lottery winning carnival worker from the aforementioned &quot;Fox&quot;, as he sought an end to his cruel suffering - and replaced it with a continually degrading emphasis on shame and deprivation.\n\nFassbinder establishes the pitiless tone of the film right from the start, with an opening vignette showing our central character, dowdy transsexual Elvira Weishaupt, dressed as a man and wandering through a park in the early hours of the morning looking for trade. After successfully managing to hook-up with a suitably butch male-prostitute, her secret is soon discovered and the &apos;john&apos;, alongside a couple of similarly macho friends, beat and mock Elvira, leaving her as a shivering, crying wreck, half-naked on an disused train-track. From here, Elvira limps home to her cramped apartment only to be plunged into a torturous, violent argument with her ex-boyfriend, which again, leaves her used and humiliated. The film continues in this episodic approach as we follow Elvira over the course of a few days and eventually find out more about her true character and personality and the events in her life that led to the eventual creation of the person that she is when we first discover her. These events are no less cruel and humiliating to the character of Elvira - who has clearly made a number of mistakes, either as a result of naiveté, arrogance or blind stupidity - as we discover the process that turned a handsome young man with a wife and infant daughter into an overweight, alcoholic wreck, abused and betrayed by the various men in her life, and the social pariahs that hang on the periphery.\n\nAs ever with Fassbinder, the presentation of the film underpins the feelings of the character and the world that she inhabits perfectly; with the cramped spaces of her apartment made even more prison-like and oppressive by the director&apos;s claustrophobic use of staging, design and composition. Fassbinder undertook the role of cinematographer himself here and shot the film on grainy 16mm, which again, adds to the stark and colourless feeling that the film conveys. The ugliness of the cinematography, with its dimly lit rooms, fragment composition and awkward camera movements could be seen as either amateurish on the part of the filmmaker, or as a deliberate attempt to distance the viewer from the characters and the emotional subtext in a manner that is reminiscent of Brecht; or, more appropriately, Godard&apos;s cinematic appropriation of Brecht and his theatre of alienation. As with the subsequent political satire, The Third Generation (1979) - once again, shot by Fassbinder himself - the unconventional approach to cinematography is combined with further elements that attempt to similarly disarm us and make the process of viewing the film as difficult as possible. The opening scene itself is emblematic of this approach, with Fassbinder obscuring the frame with large titles and an opening text that scrolls slowly over the entire frame before continuing with his use of obscured images and fragmented mise-en-scene.\n\nFassbinder also uses jarring cuts, with scenes seemingly beginning during the middle of a conversation or after the context of the scene has already been established, whilst sound and the disorientating way in which the director has characters talking over one another while music plays disconcertingly in the background all continue this idea of deconstruction and emotional distraction. The ugliness of the film fits perfectly with its tone; with the legendary scene in which Elvira and her friend wander ghost-like through an actual slaughterhouse, where cows are dispatched in graphic detail, whilst a monologue is recited to give us the entire back-story of this truly tragic figure. Whether or not Elvira is an extension of Fassbinder or the personification of Armin Meier is unknown, though there is certainly that element to the interpretation. I&apos;d imagine that there is also some of the director in the portrayal of manipulative antagonist Anton Saitz, who recalls the depiction of Fassbinder in the director&apos;s own segment of Germany in Autumn (1978). Regardless, In a Year of 13 Moons is a fascinating if entirely difficult work from Fassbinder; one that brims with an uncomfortable feeling of personal confession and searing self examination that is grotesque, repellent and utterly draining, whilst also standing as a powerful and passionately realised piece of work that is both remarkable and affecting."

John Barrymore makes an heroic Ahab, and Joan Bennett is fetching as his love interest (yes, I know). Warner Brothers went all out with this one, and as Barrymore was still a top leading man at the time, did a beautiful job with at least the visual aspects of the story, and the film is at times breathtaking to behold. Alas, they threw away most of the plot! Such were the ways of Hollywood. Noble Johnson makes for the best Queequeg I&apos;ve ever seen, though.",

      "name": "A noteworthy piece of Sci- Fi. nostalgia",
      "reviewBody": "Science fiction has long held an honorable place in the entertainment industry. Gulliver&apos;s Travels was written as a satire on Society in Swift&apos;s period, but its theme is essentially science fiction. The books of Jules Verne are noteworthy for featuring much of the scientific knowledge about submarine and space travel current at his time. A broadcast of  H.G. Wells &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, which started with an announcer unwisely declaring that the Martians had landed, caused a major panic in the 1930&apos;s; and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&apos;s, &quot;The Lost World&quot; was later made into a remarkable film featuring the dinosaur era. But the rapid evolution of films of this genre in recent years is most clearly seen in the case of space travel. When I was young space travel still seemed several generations away, and films featuring it were mostly low budget and quite unsophisticated. Today we have only to think of Independence Day or the Star Trek saga, to realise how completely this situation has reversed. Only very high budget films with extremely sophisticated special effects have any credibility with young people today. Such films do not have a great appeal for me, but I can really enjoy the nostalgia of re-watching some of the early films I first saw when a youth. Their appeal is probably limited largely to people of my age (and perhaps to film historians), so such films are likely to become increasingly difficult to see as time passes. We should be grateful to the Space TV channel (and occasionally one or two of the others) for dusting off some of them for us to watch again. \n\n\tI found one recent TV revival of this film to be a really delightful piece of nostalgia. Viewers were left in no doubt that it was pure nostalgia right from the opening shot which is in black and white and shows a passenger in a propeller driven airliner settling into his seat and lighting a cigarette. For my generation this quickly brought back memories of traditional Saturday afternoon cinema matinees. In the U.K. town where I then lived admission cost 9d (about the equivalent of 10c Cd today). Clearly at such prices the films shown were all very low budget productions that are easy to criticise today, and obviously viewers much younger than myself are unlikely to share my delight at the rare opportunity to see such films again. This film is not currently listed by Amazon, and I am not sure if it was ever available in video tape format, so there is clearly little ongoing demand to view it. Audiences today have a relatively sophisticated appreciation of space travel and would never accept the scenario of a spacecraft landing on a planet of Jupiter and finding gravity, climate and vegetation very similar to that at home, followed by the further improbabilities associated with finding English speaking inhabitants who were somehow transported there from Atlantis when this terrestrial continent sunk into the sea. However at the time that I first saw this film I would have judged the probability of successful space travel in my lifetime as extremely low; and it is important to appreciate that to my contemporaries, once we had accepted the basic improbability of space travel, all the other assumptions in the script shrank into insignificance. A few of its many incongruities have been identified in other viewers comments, but it can be quite fun to watch this film with the aim of listing as many more as possible.\n\n\tOnce the space travel premise had been accepted, we were left with a whimsical and rather appealing little story which flowed very smoothly. The fire maidens danced gracefully to well known ballet music and there was nothing to really jar in this marshmallow soft tale which passed an afternoon very smoothly. This may be why the Fire Maidens are still remembered nostalgically by many of us whilst most of the numerous other similar low budget epics produced around this time faded into obscurity within a few weeks of their first Saturday afternoon showing. Their audiences were not sophisticated cinema goers but chiefly adolescent teen youths for whom a cast of nubile young women was a prerequisite; and a decade or so after this film was released it became almost obligatory for such low budget films to find an excuse for requiring them to shed their raiments at some point in the story. Perhaps, for all but today&apos;s teenage youths, one of the attractions of the rare revivals of this film is the fact that it predates this requirement.\n\n\tIt is fascinating to see how such a story could be filmed with virtually none of the special effects we always expect today. In fact, apart from some non-burning flames and a grotesque head mask suitable for a Mardi Gras parade, it is hard to think of any. The shots of the rocket ship, both on the ground and when taking flight are quite impressive, and it is almost charming to see a long wooden ladder being used to board this relatively sophisticated looking spacecraft.\n\n\tIf you do not remember it and have the chance to see this film, my advice is put your critical faculties aside, sit back, and enjoy it. I doubt if it will soon be possible to buy a copy, but I would urge that a DVD version should be made available. It should not only sell to filmgoers of my generation but also become a valuable part of the film library in every training college or cinematographic club, where it would become recognised both as an interesting precursor of today&apos;s space travel films and as a noteworthy example of an ultra-low budget production.",

      "reviewBody": "As Christopher Reeve said himself, this movie could have been really good but the bad editing ruined it. And I wholeheartedly agree. It was a pretty bold movie, even for the bold 80&apos;s: a tale of a Vatican priest who deals with the mafia, seduces a nun and takes up arms in the war, bloodying his hands. This was clearly still a taboo, any kind of negative portrayal of the Catholic church and the Vatican. But somewhere during its 2 hours this movie lost its boldness and became just another failed experiment with an interesting idea.\n\nIn the year 1982, Reeve was clearly looking to establish himself as a serious actor and it couldn&apos;t have been easy for a guy who so convincingly looks like a superhero and who came to prominence as THE superhero. He was in Deathtrap that same year and did well in that part. One might say that this role has something in common with that one, because he plays an opportunist who is morally unclean. This movie has a really top notch cast, with Jason Miller, Fernando Rey and Genevieve Bujold as the brightest part of it. Miller, though somewhat miscast in the role of the Sicilian mafioso, brings the dark intensity similar to the one in his role as Father Karass. Only difference is, here he has a mustache. Joe Cortese is also good in the part of Reeve&apos;s old friend who becomes his business partner and the link with Miller. Fernando Rey plays the part of cardinal Santoni, who represents the political side of Vatican, the ambitious and power-hungry priest who is willing to close an eye to illegal stuff in order to achieve his own goals.\n\nAnyway, this movie is interesting to follow but sometimes it can&apos;t decide whether it wants to be a drama about corruption and moral or a love movie. Some scenes are well shot and gripping, like the scene where the nun played by Bujold discovers Reeve&apos;s true identity and occupation. It is the dramatic highpoint of the film. But the love story lasts too short to really give the movie the edge it needs, another angle. Christopher Reeve is one of the film&apos;s bright points because he really does make his character believable. He&apos;s a priest who tried to be both a priest and a man. I guess you can say that this is the ultimate theme of the film, how hard it is to be a priest and give up the good things in life in order to serve God.\n\nI think it&apos;s a great shame that this film has been largely forgotten and scorned by the critics and by the audiences. For despite it&apos;s editorial flaws and despite the screenplay not holding up till the very end, it still can be an interesting watch and a spiritual lesson.",

      "reviewBody": "A film for grown ups. It is rare to find a production which attempts so complicated a statement. While this makes OCTAVIA  demanding viewing, particularly for someone who doesn&apos;t speak its language, it remains a work of high seriousness which goes a long way towards achieving it&apos;s aims.\n\nKey is the scene where Sola, returning to the family home after years of following a troubled international career, goes through his Stasi file (given him by cop Paul Naschy of all people) with his new wife and we get a potted history of the character and Spanish politics since the fifties.\n\nThe conflict is between the perceptions of Dona Lozano the Carlist matriarch who treasures the Salamanca family traditions and young, intermittently naked grand daughter Menh-Wai/ Octavia product of the (possibly forced) union of the nun daughter (terrific performance) and a jungle guerilla who she imagines is still financing his activities from the cocaine she and her friends use. \n\nThe situation is explored in a whole variety of situations and scenics which keep turning the audiences perceptions of the characters and their setting.\n\n The ending, where the stone slab with the single word on it clunks into place, as Terenza Beganza and the orchestra provide the music which we&apos;ve been hearing through the production, is a remarkably telling combination.\n\nGreat to see the way Spanish film can still finds space for players as diverse as Naschy and Lozano."

Other than the fresh concept of supernatural - Civil War genre mixing, there is little here to like. Billy Bob Thornton is wasted in a very small role, and Martin Sheen seems to be doing out takes from Gettysburg. &quot;Grey Knight&quot; should be considered more a curiosity than anything else, because it is simply too muddled and cannot be recommended as entertainment. - MERK",

      "reviewBody": "Nemesis Game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles, death, mystery, and philosophy. In it&apos;s simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you&apos;ve finally found them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, yet Sarah is so close to understanding it all. What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life?\n\nThe movie was written and directed by Jesse Warn. While this was Warn&apos;s first feature length film, the movie doesn&apos;t reflect that at all, but instead shows polish and an artistic approach to telling the story. Carly Pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch. I would definitely love to see more of her work.\n\nBeing based on riddles, this is a very cerebral movie. It&apos;s that&apos;s your thing, as it is mine, then I totally recommend seeing Nemesis Game. Rating: 4.5/5",

In the early 1960&apos;s, Troy Donahue was the ultimate in &quot;eye candy&quot; for us teenage girls (and older women, too, I&apos;m sure). I have thought for years that I was surely the only 13-year old girl who sat in a darkened theater so TOTALLY &quot;transported&quot; for several hours by the romance in this film, but apparently I was not. I listen to an &quot;oldies&quot; radio station in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area and I cannot believe how MANY times other listeners request that the incredibly romantic &quot;Al Di La&quot; from the dimly-lit-romantic-restaurant-scene be played. Hooray for a day when sex was something seriously contemplated and not something graphically displayed like today!"

      "reviewBody": "Tim Robbins&apos;s &apos;Dead Man Walking&apos; is a brave piece of cinema. Though the film is about a man on death row and a nun&apos;s struggle to help him, I liked how he presented both sides of the central theme of capital punishment. This isn&apos;t a preachy film about capital punishment being wrong or right as I doubt one&apos;s opinion would change on that after watching the movie. But, it&apos;s more of a subtle movie that tells the story of two people who form an unlikely friendship.\n\nThis couldn&apos;t have been an easy film to make yet he manages to pull it off. Poncelet is a ruthless murderer and in no way does Robbins condone what he has done but he and actor Sean Penn manage to win Poncelet the viewer&apos;s sympathy. The execution is terrific. The last scene particularly stands out. We see, in flashback, what had happened while Poncelet meets his ultimate fate. We see how he and Helen make the final connection, we see remorse in his eyes, we see him dying a slow death and at the same time the horror of the crime is exposed to us. We know that what he did is unforgivable but he finally took responsibility for that which allows us to see him as a human being rather than a ruthless killer. This also makes the whole tragedy more astonishing because you just ponder, like Sister Helen, on how such a normal human being commit such a heinous deed? \n\nBoth Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon deliver powerful performances. We pretty much see most of the film from Helen&apos;s point of view. Sarandon clearly has put a lot of heart into the role as she skillfully downplays her part showing tremendous depth and pathos. Sean Penn plays his difficult complex character with ease. The supporting cast do well (watch out for a young Jack Black and Peter Sarsgaard).\n\nThe score is mesmerizing, especially the Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan tracks. I also felt that sense of isolation that was brought out in the prison scenes. The terrific writing grips the viewer&apos;s attention right from the start. Even though we can predict Poncelet&apos;s fate, we are drawn into the fascinating transforming journey of these two intriguing characters."

I heard it described as a kind of prequel to Bladerunner, and agree this could be true. It has a good script with unexpected plot turns and no excessive dialogue. The delicacy it deals with with issues of loss and mourning was great.\n\nIt is a new take on the classic Frankenstein story, is beautifully shot, and was an entertaining film to watch at Tribeca this year.",

Roberts shows that he does have a great deal of talent to offer when it comes to a juicy part like this.\n\nThe film isn&apos;t brimming with action thankfully but it has a number of lengthy and exciting action sequences. \n\nIt seems to me that Baldwin is becoming something of the thinking mans action hero. Whilst Willis is off doing the brainless actioners Baldwin manages to get the intelligent movie. This is a fine example as is The Edge.\n\nBaldwin makes this movie stunningly enjoyable and the supporting actors help a little but Baldwin manages to carry the whole thing single handedly."

      "reviewBody": "Anyone with even a fleeting knowledge of the life of Johannes August Suter will realise that this is an idealised portrait of the Swiss pioneer who transformed the wastes of California into a veritable &apos;Eden&apos; and was eventually ruined by both the Gold Rush and the betrayal of the American government.\n\nRealists will say that one cannot make an omelette without breaking a few eggs; the eggs in this case being the Native Americans who were reduced by Suter to a state of slavery with all of its concomitant abuses. Suffice to say, this particular aspect is totally absent from the film.\n\nThe character of Suter was obviously of great interest to director Luis Trenker as he was also of Swiss descent and as a film-maker he was able to indulge his passion for the great outdoors.\n\nThe two overriding questions I suppose are: does it work as a Western and does it succeed as Propoganda? The answer to the first question must surely be a resounding &apos;yes!&apos; The action sequences are effectively done, notably the burning of San Francisco whilst the images of the landscape, especially that of the desert, are simply stunning, not to mention the mesmerising special effects. The introduction of the &apos;ghostly stranger&apos; played by Bernard Minotti is a masterstroke and there is an extremely touching performance by Viktoria von Ballasko as Frau Suter. The thrilling score is again supplied by Dr. Giuseppe Becce.\n\nThe film&apos;s effectiveness as Propoganda is doubtful. In common with so many Nazi Propogandist films it is highly unlikely that it had much effect on the consciousness of German cinema-goers. Suter&apos;s image as a messianic leader is balanced by his Hitlerian rants. Unsurprisingly the Americans considered it anti-American whilst the Russians surprisingly viewed it as being pro-American! Eighty-five years on of course such absurdly nationalistic prejudices are both laughable and irrelevant.\n\nTrenker was very much his own man and his honeymoon with the Nazi regime was not destined to last much longer. After the war he faced accusations of fascist opportunism but these were eventually dropped.\n\nAlthough not the subtlest of directors, his films possess an indefinable, almost mystical quality of their own and of the 1,300 or so movies produced by the Third Reich this must surely be one of the most bizarre and entertaining. Despite its smaller budget and shorter running time, it is infinitely more effective than Universal&apos;s monumental misfire &apos;Sutter&apos;s Gold&apos;.",

      "reviewBody": "Before the era of home video formats, people simply had to rely on written reviews of &quot;Son of Dracula,&quot; almost all of which were negative. In particular, Lon Chaney, Jr., has endured years of abuse for his performance as Dracula (or his son, depending on your opinion). But now the film is readily available and the truth is easy to see: it&apos;s pretty good. Not brilliant, but pretty good. Chaney&apos;s performance is actually one of his best for Universal; certainly his most atypical. Chaney excelled at characters who were out of control and childlike, but his Dracula is supremely in control, and seething with menace. It is his iciest, most restrained performance. Those who still berate Chaney for his &quot;lack of range&quot; should be forced to admit that he played Dracula far more effectively than Bela Lugosi could have played Lennie. Interestingly, the rest of the cast is equally &quot;miscast:&quot; doomed hero Robert Paige was normally a musical leading man, while femme fatale Louise Albritton was usually a blonde comedienne. Both are quite effective in the horror genre. Frank Craven does well as the folksy doctor who is forced to take on the Van Helsing role (though J. Edward Bromberg is the official Van Helsing surrogate). This is one of the most unusual Universal horror films, in that it is more horror noir than melodrama--fitting, given that it was directed by noir master Robert Siodmak. It also represents the only time Dracula, or any relation thereof, is seen outside of Europe. &quot;Son of Dracula&quot; contains one of the creepiest scenes in any Universal horror film, the one involving &quot;Queen Zimba&quot; (played by the delightfully ancient Adeline de Walt Reynolds), and the most downbeat ending. All in all, &quot;Son of Dracula&quot; is one of the most interesting Universal efforts from its second horror cycle, and the fact that it has endured such a bad rap over the decades is totally unfair.",

Little do the patrons know but the celluloid baddie is stalking the hallowed halls of the popcorn palace picking them off one by one.\n\nThoughts: &quot;Midnight Movie&quot; is a decent enough slasher. It has an interesting approach to the killer and a rather cool weapon of choice (a custom made corkscrew device) not to mention plenty of the beautiful people to stack next to the projector. The visual presentation is fine as is the audio design. The production is a typical presentation for this kind of offering not too boring but not too challenging either. The script revels in the usual clichés of the slasher genre and is quite vague as to reason for the action but grab a bit of popcorn and have a kill and a smile.\n\n3.5 / 5",

This is what a great Western is supposed to be! Gunfire, fistfights, and Walter Brennen almost getting his neck stretched, twice! One of my video guides says: &quot;the pace is slow, but the scenery is grand&quot;. Most of the film was shot in the Alabama Hills, just west of Lone Pine, California. Over 300 movies have been filmed at the base of Mt. Whitney, the tallest peak in the lower 48 states. &quot;Joe Kidd&quot;, &quot;The Tall T&quot; and hundreds more were made in those rocks that are so famous. Almost as famous as any actor. &quot;Along The Great Divide&quot; is a great ride, and lots of fun.",

That gas bar is where a few misfits spend their days, like the pillars in a tavern. Will the sons continue the business when their father is too ill to carry on? Every character&apos;s future is at the end of the present day, unless... It could have been a bland film, a minor soap opera, but it is not. The actors&apos; direction is superb, and the story is sensible. The misfits could have been caricatured, but they were not; they are all sympathetic and flawed human beings, which gives an interesting look into the mystery of humanity. People like that exist, they are real, I have met them in poor neighbourhoods. The Boss is a decent person for his sons and everyone else. He knows his end is coming, and that his sons are still unprepared. Having lost all illusions, what is he to do?",

      "reviewBody": "The wonderful thing about the Road is that it will more than likely please the two camps: the one that has not read Cormac McCarthy&apos;s Pulitzer prize-winning book, and the one that has. There&apos;s the nervous feeling one gets when watching the theatrical trailer, though - will it be this super action-packed spectacle, will those images that open the trailer with &quot;THE END OF THE WORLD IS NEAR!&quot; stick around, and will Charlize Theron actually be in the movie that much? As it turns out, if you liked the book very much and worried about how its uber-bleak and incredibly dark and (especially) gray landscapes would appear, it provides that perfectly. And if you haven&apos;t read the book... it still works as a movie, as a simple-but-not story of a father and son survival drama- and clinging on to their humanity- first, and then a post-apocalypse thriller far second.\n\nTo describe the plot is not impossible but sort of unnecessary. All you need to know going in (if you&apos;re part of not-read-book camp) is that a father and son, after becoming on their own after the mother of the house exits, are traveling together across a true post-apocalypse landscape to a coast. We never are given a fully clear explanation as to why or how the apocalypse happened. This is more than fine; because John Hillcoat&apos;s film centers on the father and son (called in the credits simply Father and Son, played by Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee), there doesn&apos;t need to be anything really specific. At least this will be fine for most people who may be by now tired of the usual viral or religious or (damn) 2012-type explanations. We&apos;re given hints though, to be sure, that there may have been mutations or some kind of earth-bound phenomenon (earthquakes happen a couple of times), and past this we, like the travelers, are left to our own devices.\n\nHow it happened isn&apos;t as fascinating and visually compelling, anyway, than how it looks. The Road provides us many scenes and vistas that are precisely grim and desolate and terrible. Some of these are full of visual details like big city-scape shots, and others, like when the Father and Son are on the ramp of a highway, is intimate and hard (this setting also provides one of the most touching moments as Mortensen&apos;s character finally &apos;lets go&apos; of two important details from the deceased mother of his son). And other times Hillcoat lets us just take in the gray-ness of everything, just as one could take in the sight of masses of flies in his film the Proposition. It&apos;s against this backdrop of rain and sludge and grime and decay that imbues this intense bond between the father and son so greatly, and the complexity that comes with not just staying alive but retaining humanity and dignity and doing right and wrong by the people they encounter.\n\nThis may not be news to people who read the book. I still, having read it two years ago (which sadly seems like long ago in usually remembering specific images of a book), can&apos;t get the descriptions of scenes out of my head, or the stark manner of how characters talked and dread and existential horror was relayed. But, again, the film not only respects this but gives it further life. Dialog scenes in the movie- save for a couple of the flashback scenes with Charlize Theron&apos;s Mother character- are never obtrusive to the storytelling, which is a rightful concern to have with an adaptation of the book. And, more importantly, the acting and chemistry between the two leads is incredible. Mortensen is a given to be an actor embedded in his character, so much so that when he takes off his shirt we see his bony torso as being really that, and watching him is magnetic. Yet it&apos;s also crucial to see how good the kid Smit-McPhee is too, especially when it comes time for scenes where the boy has to deal with his father&apos;s growing desperation or the electrifying showdown with a thief.\n\nTo be sure, a couple of walk-on roles by Guy Pearce as another fellow traveler and especially Robert Duvall as a &quot;90 year old man&quot; as his character says provide some needed space, and Hillcoat has a couple of very wise flashback/dream bits with The Man and his wife (namely a very small, brilliant moment at a piano), but it&apos;s the all on the two main character to lead the film, and it&apos;s on them that it delivers so strongly. As long as you know that this is a film centered not on big action sequences (though there are a couple), and not on big special effects (though there&apos;s that too), and it&apos;s more akin to a life-or-death-and-what-else story not unlike Grave of the Fireflies, you&apos;ll know what you&apos;re getting with the Road. \n\nIt is very depressing on the whole, and not exactly what I would recommend as a &apos;first-date&apos; movie - unless you&apos;re so hot for Mortensen and/or Cormac McCarthy you don&apos;t care either way. However, it&apos;s *good* depressing, and equally the best adaptation of the book possible while a tremendous, original vision for the casual movie-goer.",

This is not one of those &quot;so terrible it&apos;s funny to watch and make fun of&quot; movies, no siree.  Instead this movie is awful in every sense of the word, for not only is the acting, plot and directing awful, but there is one particular scene which nearly made me vomit each time they showed it (3 times).  In the scene a girl is raped and killed while people watch on, obviously turned on by this, and we&apos;re not just talking males, it is the female leader who commands the man to rape and kill the girl.  I&apos;ve seen and read American Psycho, and that is not disturbing - this is.\n\nI really don&apos;t know what else to say.  This movie should have a much lower rating.  Luckily for you, you&apos;ll probably never be able to find this god-awful movie, and please don&apos;t try.  It has no redeeming qualities what-so-ever.  None.  So please don&apos;t try."

The plot is simple but the fun, witty dialog and situations that develop are very entertaining. I loved MacMurray and Douglas&apos; tails and top hats. The ball gowns were lovely to look at. It&apos;s amusing to watch the dancing style in the party scene; lively, silly and fun. A fine, light movie to enjoy with popcorn and the family or champagne with a friend.",

He leads a crappy life because he can&apos;t make up his mind about anything, when ever he&apos;s inside he longs to be out, and whenever he&apos;s outside he long&apos;s to in (that was from the book). Well one day he find&apos;s this strange box. In the box, there&apos;s a freaky tollbooth that talks. Then afterwards there&apos;s this car that shows up, he gets in the car and goes on his quest for happiness.\n\nEven though it may seem like a acid trip when you see it, as the film goes on, you can tell that there&apos;s method to the madness. I would suggest this film to anyone."

      "reviewBody": "Dull, amateurish, zombie effort about a group of militia vampires who are trying to eradicate other vampires who&apos;ve become infected from drinking bad cow&apos;s blood and who are now on a rampage as &quot;zombie vampires&quot;. The movie begins with a bunch of young people (of the vacuous type you&apos;ve seen in countless horror flicks) stopping at an out-of-the-way hotel out in the woods some place (hmmm...that can&apos;t be good). What they don&apos;t know, at least right away, is that the whole area is crawling with zombie vampires and that they have in fact landed in a war zone of uninfected vampires vs. infected vampires or &quot;zompires&quot; (I&apos;m calling them). The former is armed to the teeth and the latter is just running around crazy.\n\nThis movie does not want for firepower and the number of zombies running around loose. I&apos;ll say that much for it. However, I&apos;ll also say that if you spent an hour and a half tracing the lines in the palm of your hands it would be as interesting as this movie if not more so. I can only surmise that the people who made this film believe in &quot;shooting first and writing a decent script later&quot;. I would have gladly taken half the shooting and zombies in this movie for a more interesting story of which there wasn&apos;t much beyond what I&apos;ve outlined; just a bunch of heavily armed people out in the woods somewhere playing soldier vampires hunting zompires. That&apos;s the plot. As a respite from all the dull shooting and fighting, there are some EVEN DULLER, disruptive, amateurish intervals traveling back in time to explain how some of the militia vampires became vampires (Who cares!). That&apos;s like me wanting to know the life story of uninteresting people.\n\nSo there you have it. In my opinion you&apos;re better off staying home watching a couple of Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons or playing some computer games than wasting time with this. Although there was one point in the movie (hardly sufficient to warrant you going to see it) where, in the course of explaining themselves to 2 non-vampires, the vampires were asked what they did for a living and one responded that one of them &quot;sold stuff on Ebay&quot;. For some reason that cracked me up. And ironically, I viewed that &quot;getting acquainted little chit-chat moment&quot; as the best part of this dull, trigger happy film. Go figure.

Her acting was a little limited but she could do comedy quite well and she had that rare quality of being photogenic (and not just because of the nudes), her presence in a scene inevitably resulted in everybody else disappearing from your attention.\n\nLa Liceale is her best movie. Agreed the plot is just as silly as all the other films she made but at least the Cinematography was top-notch (by Giancarlo Ferrando), there were some genuinely funny moments (Alvaro Vitali could be funny sometimes) and even Angela Doria does a good turn as Lucia.\n\nAnd of course Gloria Guida is very beautiful.",

      "reviewBody": "This feature is an exercise in pure filmic story-telling for Howard Hawks; and the talented veteran director appears to enjoys this unusual freedom from having to worry about indoor sets, intricate lighting setups and costume designs (although Dorthy Jeakins&apos; costumes are wonderful). Here he gets to realize the best elements of A.B. Guthrie&apos;s tough novel of the early West, &quot;The Big Sky&quot;. Bringing to life the major characters of this exciting adventure are Kirk Douglas as happy-go-lucky Jim Deakins, Dewey Martin, adequate as Boone Caudill, Arthur Hunnicut in award-winning form as Uncle Zeb, Jim Davis as Streak, Steven Geray lovable as Frenchie, owner of the riverboat, the Mandan, Hank Worden as Poor Devil, and Elizabeth Threatt as Teal Eye, the Amerind girl Geray is returning so they can open fur trade with the proud and wary Blackfleet chiefs. The film tends to be a bit leisurely in its development, but the action sequences are unusually exciting, and the characters are very believable at every moment. The cinematography by Russell Harlan and the music by Dimitri Tiomkin are very fine indeed. What propels the first portion of the film narrated Hunnicutt, is developing friendship between Jim Deakins and enigmatic runaway youth Boone; then they find Uncle Zeb in a St. Louis jail and are freed to join a dangerous very-early voyage up the Missouri River. The battle between their group and deadly agents of &quot;The Company&quot;, led by Davis, are the major elements in the remainder of this often-rough, humorous and very moving story. It would be hard to credit Hawks enough for all the good things that happen in this film; he even finds a way to enliven the story by playing up the differences between Martin and Threatt one of h signature male-female disagreements. Douglas and the other two form an interesting love triangle; and the climax that requires Martin to decide whether he is going to turn down what Douglas would give anything he has to obtain is very satisfying to my way of thinking. This a film that is atmospheric, always interesting, and a first-rate look at the old West as it was before it was changed forever. The characters&apos; comments on the ant-hill aspects of overcrowded St. Louis, the jumping-off-place to the west, population 12,000, tell us that we are in a different, simpler and cleaner era of civilization. This is one of the best films about the era of the fur trappers and their ways and trade ever produced in every way.",

Because their descendants have had their identity lobotomised by neglect and divisive politicians and developers.\n\n3. Because for decades the visionaries in local government had no imagination and (deliberately?) tried to bury our grimy but glorious past in favour of tourism, spinning a tenuous link with Captain Cook who died before Middlesbrough was even invented. It was the people in my film who put Middlesbrough, Teesside and Cleveland on the world map. \n\n4. Because the TV people had never made it and regional TV is failing the region, coverage of Teesside in particular being virtually non-existent.\n\n5. Because it is the only local independent film to sell out and make money at any UGC multiplex across Britain (Sept-Nov 2004)\n\ncheers Craig Hornby, 2004",

      "reviewBody": "BORDERTOWN is more than a suspenseful film about a tragic reality that has been terrifying Juarez, Mexico for years. This film, written and directed by Gregory Nava (&apos;Mi Familia&apos;, &apos;El Norte&apos;, &apos;Selena&apos;, etc), approaches a public service campaign on the part of Nava and the rest of his cast and crew - especially producer/star Jennifer Lopez. After the stunning effect of the film, the viewer is encouraged to watch the several excellent featurettes on the DVD - and then try to remain uninvolved.\n\nChicago Sentinel editor George Morgan (Martin Sheen) convinces the reluctant reporter Lauren Adrian (Jennifer Lopez) to fly to Juarez, Mexico to cover a combustible story about the ongoing rapes and murders of women who work the factories along the border for little pay. Lauren would prefer becoming a foreign correspondent and extracts a promise that if she takes on this ugly assignment (&apos;I don&apos;t speak Spanish and I don&apos;t know anything about Mexico&apos;), Morgan will grant that request. When the beautiful blond Lauren arrives in Juarez she is shocked by the reality: a very young factory worker girl Eva (the fine young actress Maya Zapata) has managed to survive a rape and attempted murder, literally climbing out of her grave and escaping. Lauren and Eva bond and Lauren realizes that her story about the 5000 victims of this heinous serial killing may just rest with the information Eva holds: she can identify her assailants. With the aid of anxious newspaper owner Alfonso Diaz (Antonio Banderas) the three begin the dangerous struggle to unveil the truths about the cover-up of the deaths: the police and government corruption in Mexico are matched by similar deeds in the USA in order to protect the NAFTA arrangement which apparently holds the profit of the mega-factories of more importance then the mere lives of thousands of Mexican women. How the trio infiltrates the corruption (and the buried secret realities of Lauren&apos;s humble beginnings) provide the remainder of the film.\n\nNava elects to shoot this film in garish light and emphasizes the tragic filth and mire of the living conditions of the peasants along the border - each hoping to escape the life situations by crossing into the US. He manages to maintain a coarse cinematic effect that enhances the story. Not only Is Lopez in top form, but also she is assisted by a fine cast of fellow actors including Sonia Braga, Juan Diego Botto, Zaide Silvia Gutiérrez, Rene Rivera among others. Yes, the story has been told before, but that only means there are many people who want this contemporary tragedy to end. In one of the features on the DVD we are given addresses and names to contact to help stop this horrendous &apos;feminicide&apos;. Take serious note. Grady Harp",

      "reviewBody": "I finally managed to track down a VHS copy of this movie, and I&apos;m glad I did. The quality of the print is astonishing. No blurry edges or twitches to distract the eye from a superb little revenge movie. The plot reminded me of Ms.45. Woman goes a bit obsessively bonkers and vows to track down a tattooed killer when her son gets killed in the crossfire from a bodged gang hit. Cue hair dye, naff outfits, shooting practice and Japanese lessons. Woot! \n\nThe tattoo thing allows Harry Dean Stanton to reprise his wheezy old wise man role from Repo Man. A neat cameo from one of my favourite actors. Michael Madsen also appears briefly to sell his sister a gun. Well he wasn&apos;t going to sell her flowers, was he?\n\nThe surprising thing about this movie is the pace. It&apos;s relentless, and it has that moody low budget Ferrara/Cohen urgency about it from start to finish. Great performances all round from a decent cast. Shame the mob guys looked like extras from the Kojak school of pie munching. Seeing as their main role is as cannon fodder, that&apos;s forgivable. At just under 80 minutes, this movie feels way too short. It&apos;s a good lesson in lean mean movie making , and appears to have left all the excess baggage on the cutting room floor. Worth the price of the video if you can find one, and worthy of a few brews if it turns up on cable.",

      "reviewBody": "Robbie K back, after being off the grid for a week. Tonight&apos;s review is on the latest &quot;dystopian&quot; feature film called The Circle. Former Hermione Granger, and more recently Belle, Emma Watson leads the film as she attempts to take us into the workings of a technological conglomerate who has knowledge as its key principle. Yet the trailers paint a much darker secret hidden in its stony walls, one that promises to be a real nail biter. Will this movie deliver those thrills, or are we stuck with another wash out? I&apos;ll do my best to answer that question, so sit back, and please read my latest thoughts. \n\nLIKES:\n\n Nice tool development  Emma Watson  Culturally Relevant Film  Solid Moral Lesson\n\nSummary: We all know technology is becoming the heart of the world, if not already the heart of this country. And certainly, we all know that these technological marvels often require laborious development and maintenance to get the bugs out. The Circle portrays this very well, helping to develop the very tool that we all love. Throughout the journey, you&apos;ll get to see the development of the two-faced beast that is technology, and how it requires tweaking to get just &quot;right&quot;. Not the highest selling point for a movie, but pretty cool. \n\nOf course, we all know many are going to go for the lovely Ms. Watson, to support the super actress they adore. Good news, Watson does a solid job holding up most of the movie, as she is primary the only main character of the film. Watson brings her charm to the screen once more, portraying intelligence, fortitude and inspiration in a manner that many will latch on to. Her accent is pretty sound (though it fluctuates at times), but she manages to deliver her lines with a decent balance of emotion, to sell her points most of the time. \n\nYet the biggest strength of these movies is how culturally relevant it is to the audience. If you didn&apos;t gleam it from the trailers, The Circle is essentially a modernized version of the novel 1984 that once more addresses the issues of control, life sharing, and privacy. The film is certainly very political, but has a number of powerful lessons to teach about the place of technology and how easily it can be twisted. I myself liked the comments from Emma&apos;s followers, a fantastic representation of the shallow, superficial, and often selfish focus that the internet provides. The scenes are well developed to deliver the full emotional punch, which while not the most unique, can really shock you to the core at how true it can be. \n\nDISLIKES:  Cheesy acting at times  Other actors diluted  Missed character development  Ignorant/Idiotic moments  Lack of Suspense\n\nSummary: Despite Watson&apos;s strong performance, she is involved in some overly cheesy moments. On many of the emotionally heated moments, she loses her balance and stretches into the overdramatic region, losing her accent and dialogue forte in the process. But even her worst acting doesn&apos;t hold a candle to some of the supporting characters who give either emotionally dull deliveries or lackluster performances. These moments are noticeable enough to offset the momentum of the movie, and derailing it from the quality the trailers promised. \n\nAn even worse quality for me was how the other actors of the star-studded cast were reduced to simplistic roles. Legends like Tom Hanks, Patton Oswalt and even the late Bill Paxton are reduced to very linear roles, with little character development or expansion beyond what you&apos;ve seen in the trailer. With such a strong cast, I can&apos;t help but feel disappointed at the missed potential of this movie and how much this all-star cast could have done to amp up the quality of this movie. \n\nEven worse, some of the characters, primarily Emma Watson&apos;s character, become so blindly ignorant that the intelligence they worked so hard building is diluted to an idiotic level. As a result, I found myself starting to loathe the character and how 180 they took the character. Yes, I understand the premise behind the movie, but it didn&apos;t work for me. Other characters also fell into this mix as well, each built to have this incredible skill that was either not used or rapidly reversed to make the characters seem weak. \n\nYet the most disappointing aspect of this movieis the lack of suspense. The trailer made this film out to be a mystery meeting dystopian policing. Not the case at all. The Circle has no mystery, laying all the facts on the table and leaving little to be uncovered. You would think there would be intense moments of espionage, or policing by superiors to build up excitement, right? Sorry, this film doesn&apos;t have that either, with the &quot;exciting climax&quot; not showing up until the last twenty minutes of the movie. As such, the movie is pretty dull and lacks the entertainment quality you might have been seeking. \n\nThe VERDICT:\n\nThe Circle is indeed a &quot;scary&quot; film, but it&apos;s mainly due to the reality check provides concerning the dangers technology can provide. This strong message is certainly the strongest aspect of the movie and Emma Watson was a fantastic choice to deliver it. Unfortunately, the weak characters, diluted roles, and lack of suspense took away from the entertainment quality of the movie. Such a dull delivery, leaves me recommending this one for renting at home, or at least recommending you read the book (or books) it is based on. \n\nMy scores are:\n\nDrama/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0",

A young man appears and courts her, she&apos;s reluctant but their love is eventually fulfilled - and the man vanishes. This simple plot focus on the woman who is the strong character, while the man almost gives an impression of an airy faun. The sparse dialog seldom interrupts the choreographic action, the camera swiftly following the two characters across the sand dunes. Had it not been for the images of shining metal jet fighters across the sky at the beginning and at the end of the film, it could have taken place anywhere, anytime. The female protagonist is certainly a metaphor for the young Polish nation, gathering confidence after six terrible war years. Quite poetic, beautifully shot.",

      "reviewBody": "Charming Joanna (Nicole Kidman) is a successful and creative journalist of a TV channel , then she suffers a breakdown for a programme . She along with her hubby (Matthew Broderick) and children are moved from Manhattan towards the quaint little town of Stepford (Conneticut) , a very modern and upper class location . She didn&apos;t like the neighborhood with attractive and perfect but unintelligent housewives . She is concerned that many wives spend their lives in domestic slavery . Joanna early befriends a pair good friends (Bette Midler and John Lovitz). Meanwhile , her husband joins the mysterious Stepford Men&apos;s club (run by a powerful Christopher Walken and married another too perfect wife , Glenn Close) which takes place in an old Manor house . Joanna soon discovers there lies a dark truth about the strange and servitude behavior in the all female residents and the sinister secrets hidden in the Stepford town . \n\nThe film is an amiable comedy with sci-fi , thriller elements and a little bit of drama . Heavily re-edited and re-written following test screenings , with new scenes shot and others deleted . The attempts to cater to audience tastes backfired as the new edits and scenes created continuity errors and major story problems . The casting is frankly well . Thus , a beautiful Kidman and good comedian actors : Broderick, Midler , Lovitz . Jolly and lively music by David Arnold . Special mention to colorful and glimmer cinematography by Rob Hahm . This new rendition is preferably a comedy , while the old version by Brian Forbes with Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss was a chiller and considered to be very superior and being almost a classic film and followed three inferior sequels : ¨Revenge Stepford wives ¨, ¨Stepford children¨, ¨Stepford husbands¨ . The film was regularly directed by Frank Oz . The picture will appeal to the gorgeous Nicole Kidman fans. Rating : Average but amusing .",

I don&apos;t really care for circus/carnival movies, although I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot; and didn&apos;t think it could be topped. So I was pleasantly surprised by &quot;The Barker&quot;, an earthy, sweaty character study of a troupe of traveling &apos;carnys&apos;.\n\nAn even bigger surprise was the towering performance of Milton Sills, a name I had only heard in movie reference books. His portrayal of Nifty Miller, a world-weary, morally unstable carnival barker nearly knocked me to the ground, to coin a phrase. His libidinous, self-indulgent world comes to a screeching halt with the arrival of his son,Chris, played by Douglas Fairbanks,Jr. who promptly falls in love with Bimbo-With-a-Heart Dorothy Mackaill. Naturally,complications arise but the whole movie comes to life when Sills, who as a reader above mentioned, looks like a slim Walter Matthau, is on the screen.\n\nThis is a very unusual film in that it is part sound and part silent. I found it jarring to go from &apos;talkie&apos;to dialogue cards without warning but I have since learned that the UCLA film Dept. has restored this &apos;part-talkie&apos;, and that most others of this kind have been lost entirely. In fact, The last few feet of the film were lost and a still shot has been put in its place while the sound continues. Also, unless I miss my guess, that is Herman Mankiewicz himself, who has a writer credit on this film, playing a ukelele in the trio accompanying Betty Compson in her Hawaiian dance numbers. Could be a Hollywood &apos;inside joke&apos;.\n\nThis one may be tough to come by but if you get the opportunity, don&apos;t miss it."

      "reviewBody": "One of many Turkey/Italy co-productions made in the 1970s (along the lines of THE LION MAN films). FOUR FOR ALL does not have any other of the big Turkish stuff in in that were popular in the 1970s; though. There is no superheroes, super villains, no Santo, no fantasy or mythological elements. Back in the early 1970&apos;s the original DEATH WISH was a new concept in movies and box offices. And movie companies worldwide were cranking out their own Revenge tales. FOUR FOR ALL is basically a mob thriller, done in the 1970&apos;s Italian action/crime style. This is neither a Spagetti Western, nor a peblum. FOUR FOR ALL features a cast of Italian favorites who work side by side with the Turkish Stars. The four of the title include Richard Harrison, Gordon Mitchell, Tony Tiger, and Turkish star Irfan Atasoy (who portrays the man whose family is victimed by the mob gang in this. These genre faves must team up agianst a ruthless mob with never ending numbers. There is plenty of mob drama as the said gang is always trying to take over the rival Turkish gangs, to get bigger. These gangs are mostly done performed by Tuskish actors. There are some familiar Italian faces here as well. The mob eventually captures Tony Tiger&apos;s wife and the FOUR FOR ALL must team up and integrate the Mob Headquarters and rescue said family. Though this is a very low budget film, shot in Turkey there is plenty of action with a never ending body count. Additionally, there are plenty of surprises in the plot with our heroes finding out they have been set up. And not by the Mob! The score is more like a funeral march and sounds perfect for a Euro- horror movie!"

The plot was no where near heavy, the characters were inspirational and once again, Natalie Portman&apos;s cute and quirky character played a massive roll in the beauty of this movie. The story, though containing heavy content to do with the death of Zach&apos;s mother, managed to stay subtle and tenuous keeping the comedy theme going. An incredible piece and a must watch to all that have the chance to witness the film.",

The movie&apos;s storyline is good, it does have a couple of somewhat predictable turns, but what movie doesn&apos;t? The acting is very well done, I haven&apos;t laughed that much in a very long time and Reese and Mark have great chemistry on-screen. If you are looking for a really good chick flick to make you laugh, cry, and feel every motion in between, this is a great movie for you.",

Unfortunately, Horatiu gets lost in the shopping center and meets a thief,John, disguised in Santa Clause who doesn&apos;t seem to behave like the traditional Christmas character. The adventure begins as Horatiu is desperately trying to find his mother, while John&apos;s team is planning to steal a priceless diamond. It is a typical Christmas movie, inspired by the concept of &apos;Home Alone&apos;. The fact that the distribution is Romainian may be a deterrent for foreign audience. Added to this, the actors&apos; performance as a whole is mediocre and the screenplay reflects a dearth of originality. I recommend you watch this movie if you are a fan of Stefan Banica Jr. or you haven&apos;t got any Christmas-related films on 25th of December.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1953, free spirited and non-orthodox art history teacher Katherine Ann Watson (Julia Roberts) accepts the challenge of teaching in the conservative Wellesley College. She leaves her boy-friend Paul Moore (John Slattery) in California and share a house with the teacher Nancy Abbey (Marcia Gay Harden) and the nurse Amanda (Juliet Stevenson). \n\nOn the first day, her class fails under the leadership of the arrogant Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst) and her friends Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles) and Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal), but Katherine is advised by her mates and the Italian teacher Bill Dunbar (Dominic West) to not fear the students. Soon Katherine learns that the girls are only waiting to catch Mr. Nice Guy and get married and she fights against the status- quo of Wellesley and to keep her independence.\n\n&quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; is an entertaining movie about a woman living ahead of time in a conservative environment. The performances are top-notch, highlighting Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal. I bought this DVD many years ago and only today I have seen this movie recommended by a friend of mine. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Sorriso de Mona Lisa&quot; (&quot;The Smile of Mona Lisa&quot;)",

      "name": "Pivotal Film in Garbo&apos;s Young Movie Career",
      "reviewBody": "Young actress Greta Garbo was tired and homesick for her native Sweden after she had journeyed to America to appear in two MGM movies. While filming her previous movie, 1926&apos;s &quot;The Temptress,&quot; she was told her sister had died. When she asked studio executives if they could allow her some time to attend the funeral, they refused her request. Then Garbo&apos;s director Swedish friend Mauritz Stiller was removed from &quot;The Temptress.&quot; With a paltry weekly salary in comparison to other actresses at her level, Garbo was financially struggling and gave serious thought of backing out of her next film. When she revealed her sentiments to a studio executive, she received a strongly-worded letter from MGM threatening to end her career as an actress if she didn&apos;t cooperate.\n\nAfter some considerable thinking and advice from friends, she did report to the movie set for her next film, January 1927&apos;s &quot;Flesh and the Devil.&quot; She began the filming in a deep funk until the day where she was appearing in a train station scene with lead actor John Gilbert, whom she never met. Once they were introduced and shot that station scene as well as the day&apos;s scheduled intimate kissing sequences, Garbo suddenly forgot most of her troubles.\n\n&quot;I don&apos;t know how I should have managed if I had not been cast opposite John Gilbert,&quot; recalled Garbo three years later. &quot;If he had not come into my life at this time, I should probably have gone home to Sweden at once, my American career over.&quot; As one account goes, the veteran actor was bowled over by her vulnerability and took a personal interest in coaching her as filming progressed. It help that the &quot;Flesh and the Devil&quot; was loaded with intimate love scenes between the two of them. During one particularly passionate shot, director Clarence Brown witnessed the pair&apos;s budding relationship right before his eyes. He decided that instead of yelling cut to wrap up the scene, he motioned to his lighting and camera crew members to quietly leave the set as the two were still kissing. A few hours later, as Gilbert and Garbo continued their snuggling on the set, studio personnel brought in their dinner. By the conclusion of the movie&apos;s shoot, the two had moved in together.\n\nGarbo&apos;s radiance shines through on screen as director Brown called for a number of close-ups, taking advantage of the actress&apos;s stunning looks. One reviewer described, &quot;she gave a more erotic performance than Hollywood had ever seen.&quot;\n\n&quot;Flesh and the Devil,&quot; based on the 1894 Hermann Sudermann novel, &apos;The Undying Past,&apos; was a perfect vehicle for the two new lovers. Garbo plays the wife, Felicitas, of an aging count who catches Leo (Gilbert), a German soldier, making kissy with his wife. Variety called that love-making scene and two others contained in the film hair raising. &quot;There are three loves scenes in this picture that will make anyone fidget in their seat and their hair rise on end,&quot; said the trade magazine. The count loses a duel to Leo, who&apos;s sent to Africa for a few years as punishment. Meantime, his best friend, Ulrich (Lars Hanson) is asked by Leo to take care of Felicitas. He not only does that-he does more: the two fall in love and get married. When Leo returns and discovers what took place, well things get a little sticky.\n\nThe key line in the movie is when a church pastor, during a sermon, says &apos;When the devil cannot reach us through the spirit, he creates a woman beautiful enough to reach us through the flesh.&quot; The portrait of Felicitas fits the pastor&apos;s description of her to a tee. &quot;Flesh and the Devil&quot; was a pivotal movie in Garbo&apos;s career. Her performance was nearly universally praised, with one critic writing, &quot;Audiences were mesmerized by her beauty and titillated by her love scenes with Gilbert. She was a sensation.&quot; Garbo received a tremendous bump in her salary with the box office profits rolling in. Soon, the actress&apos; movies returned 12 per cent of all MGMs annual revenues at the height of her career, a tremendous amount for one actress.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is basically an average comedy. You can poke a lot of holes in the plot and there is a lot of stupidity. Yet, there are some parts that make you laugh out loud. This is an entertaining film, but your own sense of humor should dictate whether you want to see it or not.\n\nSandler and James play New York firefighters. The basic premise is that Kevin James&apos; character finds a loophole in the system so that if he marries Sandler, his children will easily get his employee benefits. Without a wife, his children would be held in limbo by the state for a while before they get any benefits. This, of course, is a stretch, but since it is a comedy you just kind of go with it.\n\nSo after James saves Sandler&apos;s life, Sandler agrees to go through with this. This is where the gay jokes ensue. Add in Ving Rhames who is a gay firefighter who comes out of the closet due to James and Sandler and also add in Jessica Biel as some eye candy who Sandler badly wants to date and you have all the ingredients of this comedy. Rob Schneider is funny playing an Asian minister. This movie is pro-gay I would say, so it shouldn&apos;t offend homosexuals, and Schneider is part Asian, so I guess he is supposed to be off the hook for making fun of that ethnic group. Anyway, all the jokes are supposed to be in good fun, but some people might get offended. If you are the type of person who gets offended easily, then you probably should avoid this movie.\n\nSome nice cameos in the film and the soundtrack is largely comprised of known gay artists.\n\nI saw this in the theater with my girlfriend. You would probably be smart to avoid the pricey theater tickets and wait until this comes out on DVD. This is not going to be a classic comedy and is not close to one of Sandler&apos;s best. At the same time, I don&apos;t think that it is an awful film either. Rating 6 0f 10 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "AIRPORT 1975 \n\nAspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)\n\nSound format: Mono\n\nA terrified stewardess (Karen Black) is forced to take the controls of a Boeing 747 after it&apos;s struck by a private aircraft in mid-flight, incapacitating the entire air crew.\n\nAnyone who&apos;s seen the likes of AIRPLANE! (1980) is going to chuckle in all the wrong places whilst viewing this opportunistic melodrama, which was ripe for parody long before the Zucker brothers tore it apart in their landmark comedy. On its own terms, Jack Smight&apos;s film - devised in the wake of such ultra-successful disaster spectaculars as THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (1972) and THE TOWERING INFERNO (1974) - is a surprisingly routine affair, directed with complete indifference, and played to the hilt by a commercially-dictated &apos;all-star cast&apos;, including Helen Reddy, Gloria Swanson (her final screen appearance), Linda Blair, Dana Andrews, Sid Caesar, Myrna Loy and Charlton Heston as an experienced pilot summoned by authorities to help land the plane safely. Black gives a truly committed performance as the frightened stewardess forced to confront the situation head-on, and she&apos;s matched by disaster-movie stalwart George Kennedy as a flight engineer charged with overseeing the rescue operation, knowing that his wife and child are aboard the stricken plane. As with all Universal movies of the period, it looks like a widescreen TV feature, and the cheapskate production values are obvious throughout. That said, it&apos;s much more entertaining than its mediocre predecessor AIRPORT (1969); followed by AIRPORT &apos;77 (1977).",

      "reviewBody": "Taking into consideration that &quot;King Kong Lives&quot; is a movie from the mid-1980s, then it is actually not too bad. Sure, if you compare it with the &quot;King Kong&quot; movies seen today, then this is just utter rubbish and obviously people in animal suits and lousy attempts of blending shot scenes to make it appear like these are in fact massive apes.\n\nBut hey, yeah this is a cheesy movie. Of course it is. I mean, this is a 1986 movie about King Kong after all. Of course it reeks of being a campy and cheesy movie. Isn&apos;t that the appeal of these older &quot;King Kong&quot; movies?\n\nThe storyline is adequate, and actually have more contents to it than the movies of recent years that have King Kong in it. That is kind of odd though, I think, as movies evolve into CGI spectaculars that slack on the storylines.\n\nSure, it was fun to watch Linda Hamilton and John Ashton stumble about in this movie. Granted, it wasn&apos;t stellar performances by either of them, but then again, the contents of the movie weren&apos;t exactly all that solid to begin with.\n\n&quot;King Kong Lives&quot; is a watchable movie, for sure. But it was hardly an outstanding movie. Nor is it a movie that has withstood the trials of passing time particularly well, because the effects are horribly outdated.\n\nI believe that if you sit down to watch &quot;King Kong Lives&quot; once, then it is hardly a movie that you will be returning to a second time around.\n\nMy rating of directors John Guillermin and Charles McCracken 1986 movie &quot;King Kong Lives&quot; settles on a four out of ten stars.",

      "reviewBody": "This film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Amazingly, it avoided all of the mistakes made in most other attempts to tell this story. The Bible&apos;s presentation of the story of Jesus is based primarily on four narratives--each stamped with its author&apos;s own personality and unique perspective.\n\nMany previous films have sampled more than one of the Biblical narratives on the life of Christ. Also, they needlessly added scenes not found in the original sources. The authors of those screenplays in merely sampling from several sources, lost the unique focus of each respective author and diluted the overall effect of the story.\n\nThis film is based on John Goldsmith&apos;s screenplay which deftly avoids all the laughably silly cliches of previous film versions. Goldsmith&apos;s screenplay is based on only one man&apos;s perspective, that of Jesus&apos; disciple John. Many stories with which the viewer is familiar, such as the nativity, are missing from John&apos;s gospel and therefore also from this wonderfully complex and yet lucid screenplay. Jesus&apos; words are not here presented as pious platitudes, but occur within a context where Jesus responded to those around him.\n\nThe dialogue is solely based on the Good News Bible (also known as Today&apos;s English Version) Christopher Plummer very ably supplies the  verse by verse narration from the same source. His delivery re-enforces the clarity of what is on the screen. Most of the other actors were not known to me--which I felt helped. (What part could one give to an actor who previously portrayed a drug dealer?)\n\nJesus is brilliantly portrayed by Henry Ian Cusick as Jesus the man with human emotions, Jesus the visionary resented by the religious establishment of his day. This Jesus did not refer to them for his authority. Cusick, convincingly portrays Jesus the carpenter as a handsome, masculine, very charismatic man. Cusick is very much equal to the task. I spoke very briefly with Cusick after the screening, thanking him for his portrayal of a part that is loaded with hazards--all of which he avoided. I hope we see a great deal more of this fine actor.\n\nThe music by Jeff Danna is wonderful--well beyond what I could have hoped for.\n\nOne friend of mine at the screening expressed his concern that this film in portraying Jesus&apos; death at the hands of the Jewish establishment might make it vulnerable to accusations of Antisemitism. I reassured him that in its earliest days, Christianity was a sect within Judaism. Almost all the people portrayed in The Gospel of John were Jewish. It was not until the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in AD 70 that the Christian sect became predominately Gentile.\n\nDirector Philip Saville has done an enviable job directing a project that was fraught with artistic traps.\n\nI hope this film receives very wide distribution. Even Christian conservatives should be very happy with it.",

There is a scene in the early morning in a field which has a sub-title,&quot;ONE HOUR BEFORE CREW CALL&quot;. There in the field we find M NIGHT walking in the field with a dozen or so  black crows for company. For anyone in the industry a director never arrives at the time of the crew call let alone one hour before. Also if this was one hour before crew call it would have been 5:00am and still dark. ON a film such as THE VILLAGE the director would arrive 2 to 3 hours after crew. Also if M NIGHT was against this from airing he would never have appeared nor any scenes from his films to be allowed. This was a very smart gimmick to raise interest for the opening of THE VILLAGE.Many people will think this to be real. For those as jaded as I it was just one 3 hour long commercial, with added commercials for THE VILLAGE. This has really made me loose respect for a director I had admired in the past. Should THE VILLAGE not stand on its own then my days of seeing anything by M NIGHT are over. SIGNS was bad enough. UNBREAKABLE even worse.Another failure this early in his career would be the end of wasting my money on this publicity hound."

This is the forty-first film I have seen by the prolific Spaniard, and it&apos;s actually one of his better efforts, a demented piece of nonsense that proves that good old Jess could make a fun movie when he put his mind to it.\n\nAntonio Jiménez Escribano plays the titular doctor, Dr. Zimmer (Z for short), who turns up at a medical congress to reveal that he has discovered a way to control evil. When he declares that he would like to test his process on a human subject, he is treated with disgust and disdain, causing him to drop dead of a heart attack. Understandably upset, Zimmer&apos;s daughter Irma (Mabel Karr) plots revenge...\n\nThis one is full of &apos;60s cheeze: an escaped criminal turned into an obedient slave; Irma performing a facial skin graft on herself that leaves no scars; a sexy mind-controlled cabaret artist with poison fingernails; and, best of all, a mad scientist laboratory featuring a glass operating table with spider-like robotic arms (why? Because it looks cool!). Memorable sequences include the cruel killing of a pretty hitchhiker, a great fist fight down a long tunnel, and a victim stalked through a fog-shrouded town -- with impressive location work and excellent black and white cinematography throughout.",

She wants him but realizes he&apos;ll never divorce his wife (Ruth Warrick). She instead marries a man she doesn&apos;t love (Henry Fonda) to break it off with Dan completely. But things don&apos;t turn out all that well...\n\nThis starts off as a very interesting Crawford movie. It&apos;s beautifully shot in a film noir style which gives an appropriate tone to the film. She plays a woman who wants to move ahead but can&apos;t because of her love for the wrong man. The direction is good, the dialogue sharp and the acting is great by Andrews (never more romantic) and Crawford (never stronger). But it falls apart completely at the halfway mark and turns into a dreary romantic triangle. The ending especially was SO predictable it had me rolling my eyes. Still this is worth seeing for the direction and acting alone. Also there&apos;s a strong subplot dealing with child abuse! So this is worth seeing. I give it a 7.",

Two is basically what makes this trilogy stand out. This is probably the film that made Ash a iconic figure in the horror genre and probably made the chainsaw the iconic horror weapon. It&apos;s more crazy and humorous than before and has way more supernatural elements going on. In fact this time the whole cabin looks like it&apos;s been possessed. Bruce Campbell again plays Ash but he now feels like a trademark character in these genre. His facial expressions and his crazy laughs are a classic. Everything is just more humorous this time around in a good way. It just has many innovative elements which adds onto the originality from the first. This one is a classic for a reason and shouldn&apos;t be missed out on. Especially if your into the horror genre.\n\n8.6/10",

      "reviewBody": "Trail of Robin Hood (1950) \n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nRoy Rogers has to come to the aid of buddy Jack Holt when his Christmas tree market gets attacked by a group of bad men wanting to take over the business and jack up prices. TRAIL OF ROBIN HOOD has a title that doesn&apos;t make too much sense but I&apos;d say the entire story that takes up the 68-minutes doesn&apos;t make much sense. However, if you&apos;re coming to a &quot;B&quot; Western for its story then I guess you&apos;d be letdown by most items in the genre as you really can&apos;t look at the story too hard. This film is mainly going to appeal to film buffs of the genre who not only get to see Rogers doing his thing but we&apos;ve got Jack Holt making a return to the genre. It&apos;s interesting to note that the story here does have a couple interesting things in it. One is that there&apos;s a sequence where it&apos;s brought up that people have forgotten old Western stars but they&apos;re now getting to know them on television. There&apos;s another scene where one of Holt&apos;s silent Westerns are shown and this was a good thing because it probably reminded several people in 1950 that the current crop of Western stars all owed something to Holt and others. Not only will this entertain film buffs but the film also features other &quot;B&quot; Western stars making cameo appearances including Rex Allen, Allan &quot;Rocky&quot; Lane, Tom Tyler, Monte Hale, William Farnum, Ray Corrigan, Kermit Maynard and Tom Keene. All of these factors make the film worth watching and of course you get a fine performance from Rogers in the Trucolor glory. Fans of the genre should have a good time with this as long as they don&apos;t take the entire Christmas tree thing too serious. Plus there are plenty of good fights and a really fun climax involving a burning bridge."

I was born in 1960 and I grew up in this era. I had the doors albums, but did not ever see them live. I felt this doc had fresh information; especially rare footage and the bands musical background and how they improvised and contributed to the songs and concerts. If you do not know things about Jim, you do not understand his drives to the dessert and his witnessing things die, and what that death meant to him and how fascinated he was and he wrote about it. For those who say there was not music, you are all out of your minds. There was non-stop music. Really? Would be nice to hear an interview? Frankly, as a psychologist and documentarian, none of the interviews would be very valuable, as the press are morons and ask the most inane questions that infuriate me and the musicians. So instead maybe more of his poetry. But I believe they did the best they could with the footage they had, real footage; which I greatly appreciated. I think if you are curious or a fan, this is a must see.",

      "reviewBody": "This film has been described as Jansco&apos;s first masterpiece. I would probably agree. The story concerns a 17yr old hungarian stranded in Russia at the end of the second world war, adrift after the collapse of the German army. He speaks a few words of German and no Russian. He seemingly feels nothing, and the film gives no easy explanations why. Like every other character in a Jansco film he seems completely overwhelmed by the scale of the landscape who finds himself wandering in almost antlike, almost always lost at the rear of a longshot. We never learn how close he is to hungary.\n\nEventually the film becomes a vivid and psychologically telling depiction of male friendship. In 1967 a story of friendship between a Russian and a hungarian after WW2 is an incredibly political subject,yet Jansco affects a kind of delightful innocence in this section and never lets his symbolism overwhelm his characters. What could have been over-reaching and didactic emerges as more of a chamber piece. I don&apos;t know how Jansco ever got away with making these kinds of movies in a soviet country.\n\nMy only caveat is that Jansco&apos;s most significant theme, political violence and its random nature, is partly explored in this film but in a way completely superficial and unaffecting compared to the terrible catharsis of films like &quot;The round up&quot; and &quot;the red and the white&quot;.\n\nOverall, a gem",

      "reviewBody": "1st watched 1/12/2003 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Brian Levant): Well-made live action imitation of the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. Maybe it&apos;s because Hanna &amp; Barbera were involved and were two of the executive producers of the movie as well as having small roles in the production.  Besides this, this classic tale of life in the stone age had tremendous casting in the way of John Goodman(Fred Flintstone), Rick Moranis(Barney Rubbel) and the entire group for that matter.  The movie starts with the Rubbel family adding a new member in the adopted Bam-Bam and then the rest of the movie matches pretty much the way the two families lived their lives &amp; worked together as neighbors in the prehistoric town of Bedrock.  Of course there is evil-a-foot within a demented man in a higher position in the stone quarry who tries to frame Fred and the rest of the movie is a culmination of all this.  What is great about the movie &amp; the series the Flintstones is that no matter what trouble they got in, the families always patched it up in the end showing us what true friends our made of.   And besides all this the movie was funny &amp; visually appealing too !!",

      "reviewBody": "Hitchcock appears to be the ghost that is haunting John Huston in this flick. Or should we say that it is Huston&apos;s homage to Hitchcock that we have here, and which seems to either spice up, or overburden the film, depending on who the viewer is. The cinematography, lowkey brown color palette and restrained performances -- allowing the vivid &quot;action&quot; to move the plot-- all have shades of the later Hitchcock movies like &quot;Topaz&quot; or the one with Newman himself in it, &quot;Torn Curtain.&quot; In fact Hitchcock made only one more film after the 1973 date of &quot;Mackintosh Man,&quot; so we are witnessing something which could be interpreted as an effort on Huston&apos;s part to continue that legacy. Some specific parallels are, for example, Newman&apos;s struggle in the river to strangle the killer-dog set on him during his escape echoing the struggle in the farmhouse to kill the Russian agent (&quot;Torn Curtain&quot;). Or the mad car chase over rocky Irish roads by Newman and Sanda, mimicking the inevitable car chases patented by Hitch in various of his early b/w films, such as &quot;The Man who Knew too Much (w/ Donat)&quot; or &quot;Young and Innocent&quot;. \n\nAnother parallel can be seen in the casting. Besides Newman himself, there is Huston&apos;s selection of the mysterious Dominique Sanda, one of Europe&apos;s most sensuous stars, whose appeal mirrors Hitchcock&apos;s obsession with the cool blonde beauty of Grace Kelly, Eva Marie Saint or Tippi Hedren.\n\n Then, too, we have the eloquent James Mason in a late role commanding the opening of the film in the House of Lords by holding forth in the grand manner. But we should guess that he is here a Hitchcockian anti-hero, one in the mold of Phillip Vandamm from Hitch&apos;s monumental &quot;North by Northwest.&quot; More parallels could be drawn, but for the mise-en-scene, Huston does one up on Hitch by actually filming in Ireland and Malta.\n\nAs for the plot it appears to have the tempting multilayered complexity of a typical English thriller, such as those in which Michael Caine appeared before he was swallowed up by Hollywood. If there are plot densities, we are after all, dealing with agents and double-agents, and things can get knotted up. In what other country than England could upperclass spies -- traitors-- be celebrated in literature and movies like the agents Philby or Blunt? Newman&apos;s adversaries are gentlemen, but not what they seem to be. We even get an idea of what an English prison is like and the quantities of laundry that they do. Last of all, who is Mrs. Smith? A name deliberately chosen for its opaqueness. Is she convincing as Mackintosh&apos;s daughter, or is she merely an agent, and not even a double agent? Yes, there are holes in the plot, but overall, the performances and Newman&apos;s Great Escape make up for the plot weaknesses.\n\nOf four ****, three and a half. Still a must for fans of the director Huston, or the stars Newman, Mason or Sanda, and the many supporting stalwarts of British b/w postwar movies and Masterpiece Theatre productions."

      "reviewBody": "I left the lights on the night I saw it. Because this does not take place in some classic looking haunted house, with some scary mythology attached to it. This happens in a modern house in a typical suburb. It looked like a house in my neighborhood. That nobody could afford to own at the time because of 18% interest rates in 1982, but that&apos;s another story.\n\nIt involves a typical family. The wife is a homemaker. The husband sells new houses in the same neighborhood that the family lives in. It must have been a slow work day for him because who could have afforded these houses in 1982 with 18% interest rates? But I digress. There is a teen daughter from some unmentioned first marriage because she only looks 15 years younger or so than Jo Beth Williams who plays the mother. There are two kids age 7 and 6 that belong to the second wife. The youngest, Carol Ann, was born in the house.\n\nSo the horror starts with harmless stuff like the kitchen chairs rearranging themselves when you&apos;re not looking but escalates quickly. And the movie tag line &quot;It knows what scares you&quot; turns out to be so true. Remember when you were a kid. What scared you? Lightning storms? Big leafless trees that looked like some kind of being with lots of arms? Clown dolls with macabre smiles? It all plays into it.\n\nStephen Spielberg &quot;ghost&quot; directed this one. You could always tell by the preponderance of wind machines and seemingly meaningless close ups - hallmarks of 80s Spielberg.\n\nThe one thing that really dates this - The poltergeist originally gets into the house when the husband falls asleep in front of the TV late at night, the Star Spangled Banner plays, the channel signs off, and then there is no signal. Cue the poltergeist. Today, channels never sign off. There is always some infomercial, with the set dressed like the old CNN Larry King Live show to add credibility, yelling at you how you can have product X for only 19.99 a month. The poor poltergeists of today are trapped listening to this nonsense, waiting for a chance to escape that will never come! Oh the humanity.\n\nIt doesn&apos;t hit me like it did when it first came out, but it is still good enough with a very shocking ending that it is still worth a a look.",

What struck me was the lack of bitterness apparent in the director interviews, given that now the movie business sucks in a large fashion - instead, folk like Friedkin and Coppola&apos;s eyes seem to positively glitter recalling their glory days. The footage of an audience coming out of a daytime screening of the Exorcist was priceless. &apos;It was - traumatic,&apos; one guy says. A great epitaph for the late Ted Demme, a thrilling film, I just wish it was longer - I could have sat through a three hour cut of this.",

      "name": "The Priceless Vignette of &quot;Coquette&quot;",
      "reviewBody": "I think it is profoundly tragic how very destructive and negative a lot of the reviews have been (on this IMDb site) about Coquette......A truly wonderful vignette, and slice of life, of American life in the late 20s.\n\nIt is truly unfair to compare Coquette to the standards of 21st Century Cinema.  There is a lot that can be said for enjoying a film simply from a historical perspective.  There are so many, many historical nuggets, and vignettes, which can be extracted from this film.  I am not speaking just from a cultural or societal level; I am also speaking\n\nspecifically from a cinematic level.  \n\nWe do have to appreciate, as another reviewer pointed out, where Hollywood was coming from, when this film was produced.  And we have to give credit to the first brave souls who endeavored to participate in an &quot;early Talkie&quot;. These folks (especially the actors, many of whom spoke, for the very first time)were indeed pioneers!\n\nWe also have to acknowledge the fact that Mary Pickford won an academy award for her work here.  As much as some of the other reviewers said that she was AWFUL, and should have stuck with &quot;Silents&quot;, I think it speaks for itself that her peers gave this coveted award to her.  This probably also suggests that many movie-goers, from the late 20s, probably loved her, and this picture (even if THEY could see, back then, that it was not perfect).\n\nAs difficult as it was for me, to put myself in the shoes of a 1929 audience, I think that I successfully managed to do this, while I watched it.  I was born 30 years after this film came out, so it was a task to put myself into the head of a man who had been raised on a steady diet of Silent Movies.\n\nIt was so exciting, watching Mary speak, knowing that she had been a HUGE STAR, for YEARS, in Silents, and finally the world was confronted with the total package of Mary Pickford-----her movements, her persona and her voice.  That, in itself, was probably enough to absolutely THRILL audiences, who had loved her before she spoke.  It must have been truly fascinating to hear what their heroine&apos;s voice sounded like, after all those years.\n\nA few general comments about the cast:\n\nJohn St. Polis (who played her father):\n\nWhat a terrific actor!  What a great voice!  He undoubtedly had been on stage and had learned his craft so very well.  I loved him in the court room scene when, as the dignified, noble father, he took his lumps for his mistakes (and was a part of that huge, climactic surprise, that took place in that room).  He died, 17 years later, at the age of 70.\n\nWilliam Janney (her brother, Jimmy):\n\nNow I will give credit, where credit is due.  He was terrible, absolutely terrible, for almost all of the movie.  He overacted in the most cartoonish, nauseating manner.  Perhaps some of his later work was better.  He died 63 years later, at the age of 84.\n\nMary Pickford:\n\nThough she began her performance, weak, and could be accused of overacting, she got better and better, as the film wore on.  By the time we reached the part, where she embraced her lover, in the woods, and told him how much she missed him, and loved him, she was giving a command performance; no question about it!  She was helped by some really great dialogue, from the writers.  There were quite a few other scenes, where her performance was just sterling!!  She died, in the late 70s, at the age of 87.\n\nI could go on, and on, with the cast.  I truly loved this film, for what it was worth.  I thought the story, and the twist ending was incredibly and wonderfully masterful!  I agree with another reviewer who said that the ending was just lovely, and beautiful (it shows Mary&apos;s character walking down the town square, with round-shaped light bulbs, from the buildings and stores, slowly lighting up, and glowing, one by one, by one).  The picture then fades to its conclusion, with soothing, peaceful music, accompanying it."

      "reviewBody": "Immersed in a world of green aesthetics, Piotr Szulkin invites us into a dystopian future where eugenics programs are being implemented.\n\nIts cinematography, consisting of mostly green and sometimes yellow, adds an aura of surreality to the events depicted in the movie. There&apos;s also a grime appearance to further its claustrophobic sensation. From Pernat&apos;s apartment to the aisles of the building he lives in, the walls are always effacing dust and the corroding passing of time. Manifestations of a dystopian reality where the good times are but memories of a past that no longer exist.\n\nThe story follows a man named Pernat, a subject of said experiments to create a better human species. Right from the start, the movie offers us images of white lab rats intersected with doctors. Images that reinforce the nightmarish post-apocalyptic reality of the movie. Inspired by Jewish folklore as well as the novel &quot;The Golem&quot; from 1915 by Gustav Meyrink, the directorial debut of Piotr Szulkin could be interpreted in many ways given its symbolism. Pernat, the golem, could be seen as a villain or as a victim of extrinsic forces whose resemblance to totalitarianism, and its aim at global dominance, is no coincidence. By reason of the matter at hand, Golem is closely related to A Clockwork Orange (1973) from Stanley Kubrick, where Alex DeLarge has to be reformed due to his ultraviolence. It is clear the movie is asking us not only to think if change is possible and what does it mean to have an identity or an existence as a being, but also to examine many institutions of society where, under a veil of good intentions, nothing is found but mechanisms of coercion.",

      "reviewBody": "Those who are familiar with the well-known 1952 remake of &quot;Scaramouche&quot; might find it difficult to recognize it in this 1923 silent version. The story in this earlier and seldom-seen version is quite different in many respects. Many of the plot points are different, the names of some of the principal characters are not the same and some of the principal characters in this earlier version do not even appear in the remake. The earlier version is also quite different in tone, being rather more in the nature of Historical-Melodrama or Historical-Fiction than the later version, which is much more of a mere swashbuckler. However, the fact is that this earlier version is actually much more faithful to the original book than the remake.\n\nDon&apos;t be put off by the fact that this is a silent film produced 100 years ago, because it&apos;s production values are excellent. Clearly no available expense was spared to make this production as lavish and authentic to the period (France during the French Revolution), as possible. The director, Rex Ingram, was about as good as one could find at the time.\n\nThe cast also features some first rate performers, including perennial MGM favorite Lewis Stone, who was probably with the studio longer than any other actor, so long that he appeared in the 1952 remake. The title role is played by Ramon Navarro, who was a major star in the 1920s. Like Rudolph Valentino, Navarro was a major leading man in the films of the 1920s, and had the title role in the silent version of &quot;Ben Hur&quot;. However, unlike Valentino, who died young, Navarro continued to work for many years, though his career as a leading man waned after talkies came in. Navarro&apos;s problem in talkies was that he happened to be Mexican, and spoke with an accent.\n\nAll in all, &quot;Scaramouche&quot; comes off as a lavish and well produced melodrama set against the background of the French Revolution. The plot points and tone are so different that it should be rated alongside, rather than above or below, the better-known swashbuckling remake. This film is very well worth a look, especially to the many fans of the 1952 version.",

But as &apos;Full Metal Yakuza&apos; is an early Miike movie, made with a small budget for the direct to video market, I expected it to be a throwaway action comedy with little evidence of Miike&apos;s future brilliance. However, much to my delight, it actually still managed to surprise me, and despite being a cheap riff on &apos;RoboCop&apos; (one of my all time favourite movies) Miike doesn&apos;t play it safe, and you can see bits of &apos;Ichi the Killer&apos; in there waiting to burst out. This was Miike&apos;s twentieth(!) movie give or take, and despite having already released his breakthrough film &apos;Fudoh&apos; it was still a long way before he was to be discovered by Western movie buffs in a big way. Miike was mainly working in the direct to video market which at the time gave film makers a lot of creative freedom if they made low budget genre movies that were able to sell a few thousand copies. He certainly took advantage of that freedom as the movie mixes silly comedy, bloody fight scenes, tacky special effects and costumes with a brutal gang rape sequence which Hollywood action directors just couldn&apos;t have gotten away with. Miike says he wanted the audience to be confused in how they were supposed to react and I think he succeeds big time! There are a few familiar faces in the cast from other Miike movies and those by Beat Takeshi and Shinya Tsukamoto, but the star Tsuyoshi Ujiki was unfamiliar to me. In Japan he is best known as a rock star with Kodomo Band. Uliki plays Hagane a bumbling low level yakuza who is killed when he gets caught in an assassination attempt on his boss whom he worships. But in fact Hagane doesn&apos;t die, he is resurrected by an eccentric scientist who has created a new body for him made out of a combination of metal and spare parts supplied from his dead boss! The rest you just have to see to believe. Hagane is far from your typical Yazuza tough guy, and in many ways you can see his character as being a dummy run for Ichi. &apos;Full Metal Yakuza&apos; isn&apos;t quite as amazing as &apos;Fudoh&apos; or &apos;Ichi&apos; but it&apos;s still pretty out there and highly recommended to fans of extreme Asian action."

      "reviewBody": "Reclaiming the word vice as a glorious vision splendid , Anita (subtitled Dances of Vice) is a triumph of pleasure and madness over the restraints of society. The film traces the claims of a woman named Frau Kutowski  - imprisoned in an institution -  to be the lush, sexually scandalous, famous nude star of the early twentieth century Anita Berber. Its an eruption of a movie, flicking between the dour black and white present and the  fantastic colour of the past (an interesting reversal of the flashback device). In a neat twist the past is populated with figures tending Kutowski in the present (the nurse is Anita in the past, the doctor is her gay suitor ). This is an inventive and liberated movie offering a dazzling array of colour, costumes  and sets along with sexual displays  and lewd nude dancing. When Sebastian does his nude dance its an eyeful indeed!  This is a great film from the noted political animal and longtime activist Rosa Von Praunheim.  There is also a documentary on Lottie Huber  available  - she plays Frau Kutowski  -  which is worth seeking out."

      "reviewBody": "It would be difficult, I suspect not to like, &quot;Seven Brides For Seven Brothers&quot;. This film boasts an attractive frontier setting, famously excellent dance numbers choreographed by Michael Kidd, powerful Howard Keel as the head of the Pontifee clan and Jane Powell as the lovely girl who is swept off her feet by his charms. Of course when she finds out that he has six brothers, all scruffy backwoodsmen in need of manners and wives, trouble ensues. But all turns out well, with a little help from a lesson in Roman history, hard work, and the willingness of six other local girls to be (finally) swept off their feet. Howard Petrie, Ian Wolfe and such lovelies as Ruta Lee, Julie Newmar and Virginia Gibson contribute to the fun as the girls; the brothers include Russ Tamblyn, non-dancer Jeff Richards and some of the best dancers on the planet. The movie also presents some famous songs including, &quot;Wonderful Day&quot;, &quot;I&apos;m a Lonesome Polecat&quot;, &quot;June Bride&quot; and, &quot;When You&apos;re in Love&quot; as well as &quot;Goin&apos; Courtin&apos;&quot;, among others. Well-remembered scenes include the hilarious barn raising, the town dance, the sleigh pursuit and avalanche and the &quot;Spring, Spring, Spring&quot; vocal climax. Forget the acting, which is sometimes a bit potty; the director and the music add to a clearly-defined script a rare sense of frontier life, where taking risks for happiness and facing the precariousness of things where life is less than settled become necessary. Very few films have followed the lead of &quot;Seven Brides&quot; as a frontier or western musical; and none has been as well received nor appreciated. What a pity, its fans say, it was not given an outdoor setting instead of backlot scenery--and an &quot;A&quot; budget...It has a few flaws; but for five decades it has been one of the happiest musical films ever made; and that is quite an enduring achievement.",

      "reviewBody": "There seems to have been some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if I hadn&apos;t actually started watching it.\n\nTo begin with, once we are in the cavern with the characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we&apos;ve been meeting in horror films since the early &apos;80s), the film is shot almost entirely in close-up. Since the actors are wearing helmet lights, this means all we see are glaring lights alternating with utter darkness - we never get to see what the characters see; so when they shout out &quot;Look there!&quot; we are left to beg &quot;What?! Where?!&quot;. Ultimately the film has a nauseating, confusing strobe-light effect, with no sense to it until we get to the end.\n\nAnd I won&apos;t tell you what &apos;the end&apos; means - but you will recognize it if you&apos;ve ever seen the old early &apos;60s Arch Hall laugh fest&quot;Eegah!&quot; with Richard Kiel.\n\nBut what crazy person would ever want to make a variation on a theme like &quot;Eegah!&quot;&apos;s, long remembered as one of the worst films ever made?! But that&apos;s what we have here, folks. Except that, unlike &quot;Eegah!&quot;, &quot;The Cavern&quot; is not anyone&apos;s idea of goofy fun. It is unwatchable. (I ran it at x2 the normal speed, just to get it over with, hoping I would actually be able to see something by the end of the film; but when I did, it was just stupid.) This film did provide me with one satisfying moment, though; since it only cost a couple bucks, after I got it out of the DVD player, I was able to smash it with my own hands - what a relief!",

      "name": "While it is no Women in Love, The Rainbow is a better film than it is given credit for",
      "reviewBody": "Ken Russell was an interesting and very unique director with a style unlike any other. This said, he was always and still is an acquired taste with a lot of his later work containing excesses that will fascinate some and repulse others. The Rainbow is not Russell at his best and it is not in the same ball park as the brilliant Women in Love, but it is still well worth watching.\n\nThe Rainbow does get very rambling sometimes- in all fairness it&apos;s true for the book as well- with a couple of overly-talky parts and instances of lagging pacing, while the first third is on occasions awkwardly staged and the ending is rather abrupt. Russell gives some of his most controlled and restrained directing here, which is a plus, and like he did with Women in Love twenty years earlier he does show a respect for the book and D.H. Lawrence&apos;s writing while not trivialising the meaning. Compared to the book and for D.H. Lawrence, while Russell is to be admired for his restraint, the film can feel a little tame. What made Women in Love so brilliant was not just its respect for the source material but also the attention to characterisation and mood and the mood and emotional impact for each scene, The Rainbow has the themes and the characterisation but it does at times feel a little tame- Women in Love did a much better job showing what made Lawrence&apos;s work controversial and daring for his time- and not as powerful as it could have been.\n\nComing onto the many good things about The Rainbow, it is a very well-made film with gorgeous countryside scenery and luscious photography that positively soars. Carl Meyer&apos;s score is heartfelt, hypnotic and unashamedly sentimental(in a good way), cannot begin to describe how much the theme music resonates with me, and the use of the likes of Bach and Strauss is equally fitting. The dialogue mostly provokes a lot of thought and flows naturally, and while some of the storytelling is a little bland and tame with a bit of rambling, it still maintains interest and contains some nice dark and passionate(the love scenes) moments and makes an effort to give depth and personality to the characters. The cast are excellent, Sammi Davis does hold her own against her more experienced supporting cast and brings a lot of spirit and feistiness to Ursula if a little too eager to please at times. Amanda Donohoe brings sultry sexiness to her role, Christopher Gable brings authoritative dignity to William and Paul McGann brings charm and intensity. Special mention also should go to Glenda Jackson, her role is a relatively small one but Jackson is so poignant in it the role is a very memorable one at the same time.\n\nOverall, better than it&apos;s given credit for and a decent film, but missing something and falls short compared to Women in Love(if there is a film that shows Russell at his best it&apos;s that one). 7/10 Bethany Cox",

It gave the narrative a jerky, confused feel.\n\nI only made it through about a third of this before I got bored and gave up. It wasn&apos;t awful, but it was never absorbing, I wasn&apos;t feeling remotely connected to the characters and there just didn&apos;t seem to really be much going on, although at the time it stopped it looked like the movie was just deciding it might need to have some sort of plot after all.

Some of the scenes are just plain eccentric, but add a certain charm, especially when coupled with the wonderful Finland scenery. Definitely not as good as the Ipcress File, but still worth a look as an interesting 1960&apos;s period piece. It&apos;s the familiar Cold War story though this time Deighton has introduced a slightly more inventive, albeit fantastic plot. In this film it revolves around a billionaire nutcase who has built a super computer that is orchestrating an anti-communist revolution. As it&apos;s the late 1960&apos;s, when sophisticated computers were becoming in vogue, expect the usual enormous mainframe with lots of flashing lights, reel to reel memory banks, clackerty-clack machines which spew paper out and electronic noises nicked from James Bond films. I&apos;m sure I saw some of the equipment in You Only Live Twice filmed in the same year. Also, I can&apos;t decide whether the soundtrack is good or rubbish - it sounds disjointed and inappropriate in some places. However, worth a look."

From reading the other reviews, it appears I&apos;m in the minority, but I can&apos;t help it. In most cases, a film either has me after a few minutes, or it doesn&apos;t. From the start, I found Gene Tierney to be enchanting and, as the plot unfolded, I thought, &quot;Ooh, this going to be fun.&quot;, and it was. People have compared this to &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;, but that has a plot even more preposterous. I mean, come one, only someone with brain damage wouldn&apos;t know Eve and Jean are the same person. So, John thinking he had discovered a method for gambling doesn&apos;t seem that far-fetched. Though not one of the best film comedies of all time, it was still enjoyable.",

      "reviewBody": "After phenomenal success of &quot;Wu Jian Dao (2002)&quot; (or IA for short), a lot of hypes generated around when next two movies in the series are announced. I tend to ignore them and do not expect anything about IA2. Before I got into the cinema, &quot;how would the screenwriters present this time,and how would they connect the characters between them?&quot;. After the movie, I would say I am not disappointed.\n\nLike IA, this is also a drama about clashes of characters, not in the form of breath-taking kung fu / wire-work actions we find in traditional Hong Kong cop movie, but starting from their own desire, intentions, hate and positions. If you are looking for a non-stop action flick, I am afraid IA2 would not fulfill you.\n\nBut unlike last year&apos;s blockbuster, the main theme of IA2 is about the rise and fall of a great gangster family Ngai, other than about the police. The difficult part in making a prequel lies in the fact that as audiences all know too well the new appearences would drop-out one way or the other and the characters from IA must be okay. So the story does not waste efforts in describing most of the adventures, rather, concentrate on how these events shapes things to come. It is sure to the scriptwrites&apos; credits and this alone casts a strong contrast to prequel movies like &quot;Star Wars: Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002).\n\nMoreover, it is not surprising for many audiences relating this with similar movies like &quot;The Godfather&quot;.  I am not comparing them here, but rather I would point out that the actor Francis Ng, who plays the new gangster head of Nagi family, runs the show.  He plays a young, well-educated, cool,calculating, witted, cruel, cunning -- and unpredictable leader. As some critics say, a CEO-style triad boss. On the other hand, he successfully shows Ngai is actually a passionate man whose family comes first. On the other hand, late gang leader is screened for one shot only (pun intended), his character is only reflected, not by flashbacks, but by short monologues recited by Ng. It is a quite demanding job and I would say Ng has done a really good job here.\n\nSpeaking of characters, another drift from IA, and many other traditional movies in the genre, female character actually plays &quot;real&quot; effects. Mary, played by Claudia Lau, is the closest girlfriend of Sam Hung. She is not just a powerless, declorative character. Like many female in the course of human history, she is the ignition point of the whole storm.\n\nIf the audiences has not forgotten IA actually hints that Inspector Wong (played by award-winning Anthony Wong) and Sam Hung (played by also award-winning Eric Tsang) have known each other for a long time. IA2 unveils their long-time mutual respects, and how all these change as the story flows along. Anthony Wong still delivers a high standard of acting just like in IA and how he plays the 3 ups-and-downs of Inspector Wong is simply terrific. On the contary, gangster Hung, Wong&apos;s arch-enemy in IA, is much lighter and more human.  As with Wong, this character experiences changes which shapes of what to be seen in IA. However, I find the last party scene is unnecessary and does not seem to connect with the firece and uncanny Hung we used to know.\n\nRelatively, the other major characters seems week. Mainland actor Jun Wu, plays another inspector who is a close partner with Wong. I could see the actor tries. Unfortunately, Wu&apos;s character is just too flat. His friendship and his clashes with Wong could not mark strong impressions among the audiences. I have a (probably false) feeling that this character is created to be destroyed and it is a waste of Wu&apos;s talents.\n\nThe actors portriating the young Wing-yan Chan (by Shawn Yu) and Kin-ming Lau (by Edison Chan) would be the weakest link in IA2. Except for a few scene, Edison puts up a regular expression of somewhat between arragonce and anger. For example, towards the end of airport scene, Lau would have a mixed feeling of guilt, anger, loss and vengence. This is an important scene for Lau&apos;s self-centered character, however, the actor simply fails to convince me.\n\nThe same goes to Shawn. He fails to play as someone who is torn between his role as a &quot;policeman&quot; and a triad member, his loyalty and duty.  Most of the time, he just plays plain and &quot;flat faced&quot;. To be fair, he gets a tad better towards the end of the movie as his character begins to merge with the character in IA.\n\nNonetheless, young actors weight must less as the others.\n\nSpeaking about continuity, IA2 does not fail in providing bits and pieces about the backstory of IA. And it is not hard for anyone to catch the images of other minor characters from IA. However, I have a few issues.\n\nFirst, in IA, we see Hung was an ambitious and man of vision, that is why he implants many moles in the police department in the first place. However, the initial character of Hung seems too soft and passive. Why does he stand by Ngai in the time of crisis?  We could not see his importance rises afterwards. Why didn&apos;t he use the chance and take out his opponents or expand his influence in the triad, then? Was he just covering himself for his long-term plan?\n\nAlso, why Wing-yan Chan remains in the end, even in light of his well-known ties with the Ngai family? How come does he becomes a subordinate of Keung? In IA, the position of Keung and Yan seems to have switched.\n\nApart from some goofs (accuracy of shooting from a paper bag, ignorance of emptied handgun and way of corspes could be burnt to ashes), the run of the movie stops rather abruptedly twice as timeline transits from year 1991 to 1995 and from 1995 to 1997. The effects on and changes of characters are not appearent so it leaves the audiences with a lot of imaginations and mental exercises. (Not that I hate mental exercises, it is rare for Hong Kong movies to make me enjoy doing so) I think the director could handle the storytelling a bit better smoother and tighter.\n\nDespite of cliches, IA2 delivers a more powerful drama than the original. The acting, directing and many other technical aspects are top notch. The scriptwriters are very clever in telling from the other side of the theme and breaks away the shadow casted by the successful predecessor.\n\nLooking forward to see the real &quot;final&quot; this December.\n\n8/10",

      "reviewBody": "Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India. Mamatha Bhukya plays 15-year-old Vanaja, who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father. If she is going to succeed in life, she will have to overcome the liabilities of low caste and poverty. \n\nI went to the film expecting the depiction of a wretched girl who is crushed by society. This isn&apos;t what &quot;Vanaja&quot; shows us. The young woman is attractive, intelligent, and ambitious. She won&apos;t accept her fate with tears or simple resignation. She wants to succeed, and it&apos;s never clear that she won&apos;t succeed, despite the odds. \n\nThe acting that Mr. Domalpalli draws forth from his cast of amateurs is miraculous. Mamatha Bhukya is outstanding in the title role, and Urmila Dammannagari does an exceptional job as Mrs. Rama Devi, the wealthy landowner who is a formerly famous classical dancer.\n\nIn the film Vanaja learns South Indian classical dance, as she did in real life. I couldn&apos;t tell how good Vanaja&apos;s dancing was by Indian standards, but the many dance scenes were spellbinding. (Don&apos;t think Bollywood--this is classical dance. It&apos;s also very different from ballet, because in ballet the dancer lifts her heels away from the floor. In South Indian dance, the heel is the primary contact point.)\n\nThis is a movie that is not to be missed. It will work on DVD, but will be better on a theater screen because the dancing will be shown to better advantage. However, if DVD is your only option, then see it that way. Just be sure to see it.",

The film is a tad dated and suffers from uneven pacing, but the performances and the sense of fun it has makes up for it. To liven things up, there are a couple of kung fu fights, a silly car chase and a skeleton of a dinosaur that serves the basis of the main. The performances are fun but very over the top, Peter Ustinov&apos;s character is so off-the-wall but Ustinov seems to be enjoying himself. Joan Hickson and Helen Hayes are great as two members of a group of nannies that even Mary Poppins fans would love to join perhaps. Derek Nimmo is decent too as the aristocrat who hides a top secret formula in the dinosaur skeleton. A nice soundtrack and good direction help also. Overall, I enjoyed it, I wasn&apos;t expecting perfection, I didn&apos;t get it, but I liked it. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

It is certainly an example of the Hollywood studio system, then in full flower, providing audiences with an experience that touches the emotions without a hint of sentimentality. Its restraint now seems like an artifact of days long gone, with so much current product catering to audiences who seem to demand nothing but mindless pablum and/or brutal sensation.

      "reviewBody": "Part 2 of The Emigrants/ The New Land duology (I&apos;m not sure what to collectively call them?) is just as well-made and as emotionally harrowing as the first, but in a different way. The Emigrants naturally dealt with the main characters making a difficult journey from Sweden to the U. S. in the 19th century, with The New Land seeing them settled down and trying to make the most of life in... well, a new land. Naturally, things aren&apos;t as great as they hoped it all would be, and the various challenges the characters are put through end up making this a challenging watch for the audience.\n\nIt&apos;s not challenging because it&apos;s boring or slow, though - more so that it&apos;s heavy-going and quite brutal in places. It&apos;s also over three hours long, which I know probably already makes it a no-go film for a good many people. It&apos;s actually very easy to appreciate all the stuff this does well, because the acting&apos;s great, it&apos;s visually excellent, and there are some really inspired editing choices in this as well (so it&apos;s not surprising to see in the credits that the director and editor are one and the same: Jan Troell).\n\nThese two films end up being about six and a half hours long, and together tell a difficult but engaging story about Swedish/American history, and the plight of an emigrant family plus all the challenges that come with both travel and settling. Not the easiest two-part film in the world to recommend, but it makes for a compelling epic that should deliver for those who find the idea of watching such a film intriguing.",

      "name": "An Ironic and Erotic Comedy about Marriage",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;A Lesson in Love&quot; was, at least to some extent, an exception in Ingmar Bergman&apos;s production which reached its breakthrough one year later with &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot;. Then continued with such masterpieces as &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; and &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;. However, even if &quot;A Lesson in Love&quot; wasn&apos;t the film which defined Bergman, it is still very enjoyable, witty and intriguing. In a sense, it meant a follow-up for &quot;Summer with Monika&quot; which gave a kick-start for the sexual liberalization of Scandinavia. In the very beginning, &quot;A Lesson in Love&quot; reveals the essence of its nature, which is veritably ironic: &quot;A comedy for grown-ups. This could just as well be a tragedy. Its protagonist isn&apos;t the man nor the women but the unpredictable life itself.&quot; \n\nThe story centers around a couple who have been married for 15 years. Both have had their affairs but now -- through memories of past and days spent together -- it&apos;s time for a possible reconciliation during a train travel where they &apos;accidentally&apos; come across with each other. Gunnar Björnstrand is fabulous with his sarcastic charm as the man who has lost his faith in enduring, eternal love. In addition, Harriet Andersson plays a fantastic supporting character as the man&apos;s charming yet rebellious daughter.\n\nIt is no wonder that Bergman chose train as the main milieu for this film which is, for most parts, built on numerous flashbacks, memories and dreams. For isn&apos;t train really the milieu which captures the core of our logic -- of our subconsciousness? During the train travel, all that is essential is performed in front of our eyes: the unhappiness of the protagonist&apos;s marriage is, paradoxically, due to its harmonic welfare. It lacks on something very substantial, something irrational. It is as if the sterility of bourgeois life had suffocated all genuine emotions which often are the factors that make marriage lively and vivid. That is to say, similar thoughts prevail the mood of this film which were due to characterize all of Bergman&apos;s subsequent films.\n\n&quot;A Lesson in Love&quot; is not necessarily your regular comedy of the 1950&apos;s but, to my mind, it has several laugh-out-loud moments. In this film, Bergman is at his best striking a few blows at the patriarchal, while depicting marriage as a real purgatory. In fact, Bergman&apos;s comedy is so black that, at times, laughter is about to get stuck in one&apos;s throat. Such serious matters he makes fun of. The whole ridiculous absurdity of the society, which is built on the unjust institutions of marriage, religion and fatherland, culminates in the dinner party scene where a prayer is rendered, a thigh is flashed and a fight breaks out. Such anarchist criticism bears a striking resemblance to the films of Luis Buñuel who also operated poignant analyses of the western society. By conducting a rather sensual study on sexuality and the contradiction of eroticism and love, &quot;A Lesson in Love&quot; even manages to gather some feminist features, making the film extremely interesting in its historical context.\n\nAlthough the film includes a few expressionistic images and discusses some existential themes, which have made Bergman so famous, it is still a very unusual work for the director. It is really the thesis of the film which makes it recognizable. For, in the end, the lesson of this session, both gloomy and jolly, isn&apos;t left ambiguous: romantic love is impossible unless if structured on the act of deception and severe self-betrayal.",

Both these stories are entertaining and filled with excellent humor and strong characters.\n\nBy comparison the third story, which is the climax to the whole thing, is pretty slow and dull, the only real humor being provided by a miniature troll-like creature.  But this anthology is worth seeing for the first two stories alone, which are masterpieces."

      "reviewBody": "Not one of my favorite Godard films - this 1990 entry, Novelle vague (New Wave, so to speak). While there were things about the film that left me un-fulfilled after repeat viewings, I probably can&apos;t recommend the film to someone who might, by the luck of the invisible film-geek Gods, find the tape in the video-store and only will watch it once. By the time I had my third viewing of this (the first two times I just couldn&apos;t get through to the end, maybe too tired, maybe just not in the mood for so much Godard going on), I respected it a little more than on my first viewing, though that&apos;s giving it some more credit than it should. Bottom line, folks, this is a hard-core, un-abashed art-film, where symbolism is turned up to eleven on the intellectual amp, images are put forth that do hold interest (and when I say that I mean sporadically) in the poetic, love nature over the man-made structure sense, and of course Alain Delon and Domiziana Giordano as the lead couple. Although Giordano is given some emotions to work with (and her start to the film, in which she accidentally runs over a hitchhiker on the road, should kick off something more interesting than it does), Delon mostly walks around with the same face, looking dour and un-happy until midway through the film, which I won&apos;t spoil. To put it another way, it makes his performance as the ultra low-key killer in Le Samourai look like Robert De Niro in Goodfellas. \n\nTo say that the film has no coherent plot is a give-away. If you&apos;re looking for the kinds of stories that kept Godard&apos;s new-wave films of the 60&apos;s, which were interspersed here and there with the philosophy and poetry he over-loads here, may be disappointed. In fact, the film almost achieves an ironic success in making the film far from the real purpose of the new-wave to start with. Godard gives us characters in this film, but some are left on the screen so briefly it&apos;s hard to comprehend what they&apos;re talking about. Some of the stuff on the corporations are interesting, as well are a few pivotal scenes to what story there is, but then it&apos;s gets downplayed by the mainly pretentious attitude. Maybe my biggest problem with the film is that Godard seems to be backing a viewer, not just myself but any particular viewer who&apos;d seek this film out, into a corner- a part of me feels guilty for thinking a lot of the film just wasn&apos;t good because there was some good to it. The editing by Godard himself had a rhythm to it I kinda dug, the cinematography kept the colors vivid, and the choices in music were the typical, free-fancy Godard we know from the 60&apos;s. \n\nBut in all, and perhaps I can&apos;t put my finger on it, Novelle vague is just not my cup of tea. Maybe someday some hip, cool movie professor will give me another perspective on what I&apos;m missing.",

The repertory of Sennett and Roach gags rarely extended beyond mild parody, primitive slapstick, and artificial trick effects, giving an entirely false but lasting impression of silent comedy as nothing but frantic pratfalls and pie fights. The exception here is Laurel and Hardy, whose deliberate methods of wreaking mayhem overturned the time honored formula of fast and furious chases. Happily, the film gives them extra attention, but the majority of footage is devoted to second-rate clowns like Billy Bevan and cross-eyed Ben Turpin. Even the great Harry Langdon is represented only in a clip from a minor Sennett short which gives little indication of his unique talents, and the enthusiastic voice-over narration underlines his lackluster antics with forced wit and too many puns.",

Were there many anthology films made during this time? &quot;Flesh and Fantasy&quot; (1943) comes to mind but &quot;Dead of Night&quot; is superior. The plot involves an architect who arrives at a country house for work, in a recurring nightmare, and he&apos;s terrified because he knows how this nightmare is going to end... At the house there are a number of guests and they soon fall into talking about their own horrifying supernatural tales.    The stories of each of the guests range from semi-comical (the &quot;golfing&quot; episode was my least favorite, although there was one chilling moment even in that one) to the terrifying (the best of the lot, imho, is the &apos;ventriloquist&apos; episode). Some have speculated that Rod Serling probably drew heavily on &quot;Dead of Night&quot; when writing a number of scripts for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (as just one example, the scene where the dummy bites the hand of the ventriloquist is copied almost exactly in the TZ ep &quot;The Dummy&quot;). I&apos;m not sure if this movie was a blockbuster at the time, but I think it was ahead of its time in terms of depth of concepts, in that there is more than meets the eye.",

      "reviewBody": "The term &quot;propaganda&quot; has taken on a very negative connotation, though propaganda can also be a very positive thing--encouraging the masses through logical and/or emotional appeals to get on the bandwagon on a certain topic. In this case, the effort was noble--encouraging people to understand why we were fighting the Axis powers as well as drumming up their support. Now these types of films were made in the hundreds in the USA during the war and many of them are pretty forgettable. However, this might just be one of the very best due to its magnificent writing and acting. Plus, in many ways it&apos;s similar to the British wartime film IN WHICH WE SERVE (1942)--but I think that ACTION IN THE NORTH Atlantic is actually a bit better film. Much of this is because the acting is at least equal to the British film (Humphrey Bogart and Raymond Massey versus Noel Coward and John Mills in the 1942 film) and the story is a bit more exciting in ACTION IN THE NORTH Atlantic. Plus, I admired how the often forgotten men of the merchant marine were shown to be heroes--after all, a lot of them died transporting supplies to Britain during the war.\n\nBoth films excelled because unlike some jingoistic wartime films, the Allies were NOT shown as super-humans who could do ridiculous things (like in the movie AIRFORCE where a B-17 shoots down fighter plane after fighter plane--something that just could never have happened). In fact, both films feature ships being sunk right out from under the stars in the first half hour of the film! But here&apos;s where the films really succeeded, as they showed the indomitable human spirit that despite losses, continues to bravely and without too much complaint do their job. Balancing this need with the families back at home make these both stellar films. In fact, now that I think about it, I STRONGLY recommend you see both. Yes, they are similar, but also different enough to provide a lot of entertainment and wonderful insight into our history.",

This film was the only film that deeply impressed me in the whole festival.\n\nThe main idea of the movie is &quot;an accident effects different people from different cultures in different ways.&quot; But story telling is amazing. Great music composition and production is used to complete the wonderful photography of the film. All the actors did their best but I really liked the shooter most.\n\nIn the context, we are able to see some kind of a projection of real life. A drama is not all about sadness and misery, also funny things do not happen only in comedy films. Life is a whole with all tones of gray, not blacks and whites only. So this movie gave me that feeling in a sensitive way. And as a great point, the miscommunication between the Turkish father and the German mother was a really impressive scene. Wherever you are, communication works both ways and fails if the link is broken on one side.\n\nMaybe telling different stories in the same time line is a bit risky thing because people are used to find themselves a lead actor to follow the feelings, this movie breaks that idea and maybe it&apos;s hard for some people to follow the whole story. But personally I really like the scenario as much as I like the production of the movie.\n\nI hope to see more wonderful works from this crew.",

While the latter present limited, sanitized and artificial-looking depictions of life under the Nazi rule, Romm&apos;s &quot;Ordinary Fascism&quot; pulls out all the stops in its selection of documentary material to draw the viewer not only into absolute horror about fascism and nazism in the 1920s-1940s Europe, but also to a firmest of convictions that nothing of the sort should be allowed to happen again anywhere in the world.\n\nNote the timing: the film was released in 1965, in the Soviet Union&apos;s heyday at the height of the great societal and intellectual &quot;thaw&quot; that followed the Stalin&apos;s death and the denunciation of Stalin&apos;s totalitarianism by Nikita Khruschev. Never explicitly mentioning any of them explicitly, the film targets tyranny and despotism no matter what form they may take; the release of such a film would have been impossible under Stalin.\n\n A good indicator of the power of this film could be the fact that it is available in most video stores in Germany."

      "reviewBody": "What a damn shame! Never before I encountered a movie with such potentially brilliant story ideas, and yet somehow it ended up being an indescribably irritating and tragically dull mess! The main character, as well as most of the supportive ones, is probably the most fascinatingly eccentric person to ever lead a modern horror adventure and the situations she encounters are inventive and freaky as hell. Sounds terrific, but then what went wrong? I tell you what went wrong; director Gregory Hatanaka keeps on interrupting his own fabulous concepts with pseudo-artistic nagging and visual gimmicks that totally ruin the pace and the low-budget exploitation atmosphere. The young, intelligent and sexy Therese is the ideal woman. Therese is a nymphomaniac, desperately in love with a sinister TV-evangelist, but she also won&apos;t say no to some lesbian sex or even an incestuous relationship with her crazy brother Thierry. She&apos;s a food inspector and he imports meat of questionable quality standards. Convinced she&apos;s infected with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after eating one of her brother&apos;s Canadian steaks; Therese slowly loses her mind and starts to believe she&apos;s the Kung-Fu fighting heroine of her own favorite grindhouse movie &quot;The Girl with the Thunderbolt Kick&quot;. The plot is so demented it becomes brilliant, like Tarantino on acid, especially when Therese considers herself to be on a mission to annihilate the Ten Tigers of Kwan Tang, or whatever they&apos;re called. It&apos;s a really regrettable to announce that  according to me personally, at least  the ingeniousness of the plot is brought down by experimental editing, exaggeratedly hectic camera-work and the director&apos;s super massive ego. &quot;Mad Cowgirl&quot; is gory, sleazy and surrealistic, but it quite isn&apos;t the homage to rancid 70&apos;s exploitation director Hatanaka intended it to be. It&apos;s more reminiscent to Gregg Araki&apos;s &quot;The Doom Generation&quot;, only with even more nastiness and dementia. Sarah Lassez is a rather talented young actress and I hope she&apos;ll be offered some better screenplays in the near future. Young cult icon and inexplicably cool dude James Duval is his usual confused self as Therese&apos;s brother and I&apos;m sure nobody expected Star Trek veteran Walter Koenig to appear in a production like this, and definitely not in the unconventional role of uncanny TV-preacher. The film contains loads of unexplained  but rather fascinating  little elements, like some of Therese&apos;s acquaintances speaking foreign languages (and she being able to understand them) and brief flashes of Japanese news reports. Weird  but too obviously wannabe-intellectual for no reason. &quot;Mad Cowgirl&quot; has quite a large fan-base and the most fanatic admirers will probably claim that I completely don&apos;t understand the underlying brilliance of Hatanka&apos;s filming style, but whatever. The film could have been much better.",

It reminded me of how little I&apos;m aware what&apos;s going on in the world, even next door to where I was born and my own childhood.It reminded me that the humanity in me hasn&apos;t died yet but needed to be woken up. It&apos;s about a tough life where the kids are in charge of adults and more mature than them. The movie gives a clear picture of a bunch on refugee Kurds on their own land. Ghobadi cleverly draws the picture of a disaster in the Middle East: The Kurds, who has been on that land for thousand of years but still don&apos;t own a flag and their struggles between Turkey, Iraq,Iran and America.\n\nAny one, who is interested in a bit of information about what&apos;s going on over there as well as the other problems in the area should see this movie. A black comedy in some ways when you can&apos;t help smiling while crying.",

      "reviewBody": "Fans of Mario Lanza and operetta will find The Student Prince a treat to watch and to listen to. The Student Prince is not a faithful treatment of Romberg&apos;s operetta(&apos;mangled&apos; is pretty apt here), but to me that didn&apos;t matter, what was more important was how The Student Prince fared on its own merits as a film and it fares very well.\n\nIt has sumptuous production values in costumes, lighting and most sets(apart from a couple of very studio bound-looking outdoor exteriors) and is shot in lavish Technicolour, so it looks pleasing. Romberg&apos;s score is stylish and whimsical and his songs wonderful, both in the operetta and in the film. In the film, the standout songs and renditions are Deep in my Heart, Dear, Serenade and the very emotional I&apos;ll Walk with God. The Student Prince also boasts some very witty dialogue, an engaging story that still resonates today and is less creaky than the story of the operetta(better than any of the stories from any of the films with Mario Lanza on screen) and the ending is heart-breaking.\n\nEven when Lanza is not on screen(he was meant to originally star in the leading man role) and present in voice only, he still makes a great impression. Lanza had one of the most beautiful and most immediately recognisable voices for any tenor and even singer, and he sounds magnificent here as to be expected, his phrasing, vocal emotion and musicality also top-tier. Edmund Perdum had a truly daunting task replacing Lanza and then having to act to his singing voice, and he does a more than credible job with it, while stiff in demeanour at times(but that worked for the character actually) he plays the role with more likability and and charm than Lanza most likely would have done if he did it. Ann Blyth is radiant and noble as well as playing with natural spunk, her voice blending very nicely with Lanza&apos;s. Edmund Gwenn, Louis Calhern, John Williams and SZ Sakall provide seasoned support.\n\nOn the other hand, Richard Thorpe&apos;s direction is very limp and lacking inspiration in places, some scenes that came over as a little tedious as a result did cry out for a more light-footed and wittier touch, something that Vincente Minnelli would have brought if he&apos;d been chosen. Some of the additional dialogue veers on a bit banal and corny, though most of the dialogue sparkles.\n\nIn conclusion, looks and sounds wonderful and an entertaining film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The film starts quite slow until the point were it starts to build up some excitement. The aliens were quite menacing looking and the special effects were all rather good. What was most interesting about this film is that this was apparently based on true events but obviously some parts were added for a certain amount of scares.\n\nThe film is not a must see but is quite unsettling and quite disturbing worth your time if you can be bothered.",

      "reviewBody": "The film begins with a preface : &apos;Il n&apos;y&apos; a pas plus profound solitude que Celelle samurai Si Ce Nést Celle Dún Tigre Dans la jungle..Peut-etre..&apos;Le Bushido. Samurai&apos;s solitude is only comparable a tiger into jungle . Stars Jef Costello (Alain Delon as excellent anti-hero) is a cold professional killer , he establishes an alibi with the help his lady-lover (Nathalie Delon) and unexpectedly in an act of almost unknown compassion by a club&apos;s piano player (Rosier). Meanwhile , he&apos;s double-crossed and an obstinate police inspector (Francois Perier) track him down . The precise murderer is pursued throughout the Paris&apos;underground . Then the doomed Costello becomes an avenging angel of death seeking for vengeance.\n\nThis is the best of Melville&apos;s thrillers with magnificent Alain Delon as the expressionless murderous . Delon has striven in vain to repeat this success in numerous subsequent movies at the same genre , similar others known actors as Lino Ventura , Jean Paul Belmondo and generally directed by Henri Verneuil , Jose Giovanni and Jacques Deray . The movie packs a splendid cinematography by Henri Decae , the photography glitters as metallic and cold as a gun barrel . The picture was perfectly directed by Jean Pierre Melville , giving a memorable work . Later his beginning as a post-war forerunner of the &apos;Nouvelle vague&apos; , he left his style in several different ways as a purveyor of a certain kind of noir movie , creating his own company and a tiny studio . Although retaining its essential French touch and developing a style closer to the world of the American film Noir of the 1940s than any of their other such foray s. Dealing with character-studio about roles damned to inevitable tragedies , powerful finale , stylized set pieces heightens the suspense and tension have place all around the Melville&apos;s filmmaking . His movies and singular talent are very copied and much-admired by contemporary directors, specially the &apos;Polar&apos; or noir French cinema , such as : &apos;Second breath&apos; , &apos;The red circle&apos;, &apos;Dirty money&apos; and , of course , &apos;Le samurai&apos;.",

The high concept of this fast, funny, suspenseful Warners adventure is basically &quot;Damon Runyon Meets The Nazis.&quot; I especially got a kick out of the breezy, sometimes punny dialogue (like &quot;We&apos;ll get them by the seat of their Panzers&quot; and &quot;Hey, there&apos;s more here than meets the FBI!&quot;) and its delightful euphemisms for Bogie&apos;s line of work, such as &quot;man about town and well-known figure in the sporting world.&quot; (My late dad was a bookie, so I should know! ;-) Bogart, Demarest, McHugh, and charming leading lady Kaaren Verne are joined by smooth villains Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre, and Judith Anderson, and on the good guys&apos; team, Jane Darwell (as Bogie&apos;s mom!), Edward Brophy, Barton MacLane, and even a young Phil Silvers and Jackie (C.) Gleason! Alas, Pearl Harbor was still too fresh in 1942 audiences&apos; minds for them to appreciate a quasi-realistic World War 2 spy thriller with broadly humorous overtones. Luckily, ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT is available on home video and Turner Classic Movies so you modern movie lovers can enjoy this entertaining genre blend!",

The late Kenneth Williams played Dr. Watt who was the fiendish brains behind an evil plot. He had a huge Frankenstein-like henchman called Oddbod who would kidnap women for him. He would then turn the women into dummies and sell them to a local shop. Crazy eh?\n\nI won&apos;t spoil any of the scenes for you but they are all funny and there&apos;s some great dialogue throughout. As for the ending, it had me in stitches.\n\nI really believe this is the best Carry on Film in the series so I recommend checking it out."

On paper, it sounds like your average Texas Chainsaw Massacre rip off following a handful of young adults who break down during a road trip and find themselves stuck at a creepy, nearly abandoned wax museum and tormented by a deranged psychopath.\n\nTourist Trap takes this already well-worn formula and injects it with a pleasant amount of surrealism and nightmarish imagery. Chuck Connors stars as Mr. Slausen, the proprietor of said wax museum who seems concerned that his brother, Davy (who lives in the house down the hill from the museum), won&apos;t take too kindly to intruders. It&apos;s an unexpected and fun performance from him and he really gets into it.\n\nFuture Charlie&apos;s Angel Tanya Roberts offers up some eye candy in a halter top as one of the victims, but it&apos;s Jocelyn Jones as the prudish Molly who steals the show and creates a very genuine nervous breakdown as the horror builds.\n\nThere are elements of House of Wax, Carrie, and a few others thrown in, but Tourist Trap really isn&apos;t like anything else from that time (or any time). It&apos;s a unique and creepy entry in the 70&apos;s horror cannon.",

In the film, TV is constantly there with you, you can&apos;t escape it and, slowly but surely, it changes your sense of reality. The result is a numb society, lacking the capacity to feel and emphatize. That is far more frightening than just TV-violence, which, after all, just presents the means of expressing aggression. Kassovitz realises this and directs a shocking but fantastically sharp film that follows its own path of logic owing nothing to any other film. I can&apos;t remember the time I&apos;ve been shaken like this by a motion picture. It&apos;s a shame there hasn&apos;t been more discussion (in Finland, anyway) about the media-cultural issues Assassin(s) brings forward.",

The screenplay, story narration and especially dialogues each and everything is good, only thing i disliked in this movie is songs they are worst. Please skip all the songs while you are watching this movie 😁.\n\nComing to story deva katta got inspiration from vyasa Mahabharatam, family fued between brothers which end up in killing several people in kurukshetra war.

The film is actually a quite complex mix between fiction and documentary, which should&apos;t be a surprise considering it&apos;s the second feature film from Brosens and Woodworth, creators of Khadak, a film that also lies in this intriguing conception of cinema. But, unlike Khadak, Altiplano has a very strong and story oriented narrative, which is extremely good, since the constant allegorical images that the movie possesses are much more well timed and effective than in Khadak. Apart from the style issues, the movie is a intense journey in the fight between modernism and tradition, nature and city. I don&apos;t want to give away anything, because seeing this filme without any kind of expectations (storywise, that is) is the best way to enjoy it. Visually stunning, with a exceptional soundtrack, Altiplano is, despite his flaws, a movie that should be watched for anyone that likes cinema or, at least, original cinema. If you belong to that group, go see it. Don&apos;t expect action packed sequences, or determined heroes overcoming evil. Altiplano is about life. Slow, real, and unforgiving.A really good film with some brilliant moments. If you like cinema, take a chance on this one. It&apos;s worth it.",

      "reviewBody": "... and you&apos;ll probably love it! *g* Austrian actor Peter Weck (quite famous in this country) plays a child psychologist who is offered a job on a castle in Tyrol. There is a catch to it, though: The castle belongs to an eccentric American lady, who thinks that only a father can do this job properly. Dr. Burger (Peter Weck) has no children. In comes a Danish girl called Rena (Gitte Haenning), helping Dr. Burger by pretending that she is his daughter and singing some weird songs like &quot;Die kleinen Mädchen haben brav zu sein&quot; (&quot;Small girls have to be good&quot;). That is the basis for a lot of confusions, including a totally illogical spanking scene where Burger and Rena keep pretending as if they were father and daughter, although they are alone in a room.\n\nIf you watch this film from a serious point of view, expecting some kind of sophisticated entertainment, you will surely be disappointed or even shocked by its primitiveness. But if you lean back and watch it with loving sarcasm, you will enjoy it!!",

      "reviewBody": "Artistically, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is quite well made... I do recall several media reports at the time of the film&apos;s release that led to contrary impressions, supporting the deliberate attempt by the filmmakers to do a hatchet job on the setting of this film. The first was Billy Hayes himself, when he first arrived on native soil, having pulled off his alleged escape; he said on TV, &quot;I like the Turks...it&apos;s the prison I had a problem with&quot; Easy to understand; few prisons are a joy ride, regardless of nation of origin. From this, I gathered he personally didn&apos;t have an animosity against the Turks, although MIDNIGHT EXPRESS goes out of its way to make everything negative about the country and culture. Only the &quot;Western&quot; characters are good and attractive, and the folks selected to play the Turks are corrupt, physically ugly and basically sub-human. The exterior scenes in Turkey itself have a grayish tint, implying the land is a hell-hole, and even the near-universally acclaimed cuisine gets a black eye.\n\nThe second thing from the (film&apos;s release) period I recall was a discussion on radio that claimed the prison Billy served time in was relatively modern, built in the mid-sixties... and not the Devil&apos;s Island PAPILLON setting depicted in the movie. (A 19th-Century British barracks in Malta was used for the prison.) Naturally, some artistic leeway is allowed here, since the movie&apos;s purpose is to paint a picture of a living nightmare.\n\nI recall reading the book years ago, and when our hero got his unfair sentence, naturally he was in despair... but at that moment, he felt an almost gallant, resigned acceptance. In contrast, when Billy gave his courtroom speech in the movie (which certainly was a defining moment of the film&apos;s ill-naturedness... to quote part of the speech: &quot;For a nation of pigs, it sure seems funny that you don&apos;t eat them! Jesus Christ forgave the bastards, but I can&apos;t! I hate! I hate you! I hate your nation! And I hate your people! And I f**k your sons and daughters because they&apos;re pigs! You&apos;re all pigs!&quot;), the three ugly judges actually hung their heads in shame. I wonder if there&apos;s a courtroom in any nation that would permit such a prolonged and loud outburst.\n\nThe August 30th post mistakenly referred to Turkey as an Arab nation.... so the user must not have seen &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; where the Arabs were the heroes and the Turks were the villains. It&apos;s interesting that in the rare Hollywood film where Arabs are portrayed &quot;positively,&quot; Turks still come across as barbaric.\n\nA Turkish-American friend has told me, contrary to what others here are thinking that the film couldn&apos;t really prejudice the viewer, that the film has achieved one of its purposes, to leave a sore, anti-Turkish taste in mouths. Keeping in mind that Americans are generally ignorant of the ways of many foreign nations, this film continues, even today, of being the only source of information most Americans have about Turkey. As cinematically effective and wonderfully made this film is, there&apos;s a disturbing side to MIDNIGHT EXPRESS that makes it mildly resemble a contemporary &quot;Jude Suess,&quot; or THE ETERNAL JEW (&quot;Der Ewige Jude&quot;)."

      "reviewBody": "Watching this movie, the first thing that came to mind was, &quot;Wow, these kids sure are fake.&quot; In many initial reviews, this movie was derided as being a joke. It was either hearing about the various nude scenes of Anne Hathaway or a bunch of white kids trying to act black, and doing it poorly.\n\nI said that that &quot;fake&quot; was the first thing that came to mind, because we are immediately presented with this group of rich white kids acting like they are black. However, it is being mistaken by some reviewers that these actors are doing a bad job. What we are really seeing is truly how superficial that these kids are. They are fake, in every sense of the word, and that is the whole point of the movie. Don&apos;t try and act like something you aren&apos;t because there are consequences.\n\nI say this is a social commentary, not perfectly executed, but still fairly well done nonetheless. It does truly present many aspects of youth behavior nowadays that most people don&apos;t really look at. We are given a true side to high school, where there are fake people everywhere, underage and illegal activity is happening, and its all going on without parents there to see. This movie takes the comedy out of the teenage life that has been prevalent in movies over the past 8 years or so such as American Pie and other similar styled teen comedies and turns it to a sort of opposite view. Now I am not by any means saying that this movie is a guiding light which everyone should see. In fact, I don&apos;t know if this movie is for everyone, because of the issues it presents. Some people, especially parents, would undoubtedly have problems coming to terms that the behavior seen in this movie happens. Now it doesn&apos;t happen everywhere, or in every school, but I&apos;m pretty sure that you know what I mean.\n\nI think this movie, is backed up by pretty well performed acting done by the majority of its cast. Anne Hathaway, who many doubted had the range to tackle such a role, seemed very natural in the part. I don&apos;t mean that negatively, and I actually give her credit for really becoming the character. The rest of the cast does a good job, but it is her performance that truly helps you understand most of the underlying message of the movie.\n\nI know that some will not see in this movie what I saw, but to each their own. I do hope that people see this movie and don&apos;t criticize it solely on what they think is bad acting. It has a much deeper theme than that, and I think that the more people understand that, the more people will realize this is a pretty good movie.",

And I never got to sit back.\n\nThis was a psychological thriller of the best type. There is plenty of opportunity for you to nominate the &quot;bad guy&quot; and while you may be right in a sense you will probably also be wrong. The ending is a real shocker - and I suspect that the typical reaction of many viewers is to say &quot;No way&quot; - but if you think about it, it is the only possible ending. But you have to think about it - and the film is so action-filled that you never have time. SO the realization must come after the closing credits roll.\n\nI&apos;d never seen John Cusack in anything but a comedy before (except for a film called &quot;Max&quot;, but I saw that before I knew who Cusack was). He pulled off drama equally as well as he does comedy. An impressive talent.\n\nAnd an impressive film.",

I have seen it many times, and am struck by the surprisingly &quot;right&quot; atmosphere, touched by the landscape that I know so very well, and fascinated by the action. OK, so it&apos;s Hollywood, but somehow, I have the feeling they don&apos;t make movies like this any more. Pity! Well, maybe I&apos;m getting old.",

      "reviewBody": "This film made major concessions to political correctness in its portrayal of the Indians, who are depicted in a considerably more flattering light here than they are in Brian Moore&apos;s novel. This could also be considered the romanticizing &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; effect. The novel drew some (unjust) criticism here in Canada for its uncompromising approach.\n\nThe actual history is fairly readily available. &quot;The Jesuits in North America in the 17th Century&quot; by the great American historian Francis Parkman is the standard 19th c. work on the proselytizing efforts of the French Récollet and Jesuit fathers.\n\nStill, if you are not very familiar with the subject, this film is a strong, and quite gruesome, introduction. I&apos;m not aware of a lot of films about the colonial period which are as tough. Not &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;, or the adult westerns from the &apos;50&apos;s, in my opinion. &quot;Little Big Man&quot;, perhaps. Or possibly &quot;A Man Called Horse&quot;, which I haven&apos;t seen. The priest in the story is a composite of actual missionaries, and the impact of this historical adventure thriller is heightened for me knowing that everything in this film happened, and often a whole lot worse.\n\nThe rights and wrongs, the pros and cons, of the cultural collision of Europeans with the autochthonous peoples are still too contentious, so I would rather not get into them. There is a lot here to brood about afterwards, and chances are good that you&apos;ll seek out a copy of the novel -- it&apos;s not very long, and a lot easier to read than James Fenimore Cooper. If you&apos;re American or Canadian, this is an important part of our shared past.\n\n&quot;Black Robe&quot; is one of the very best Canadian feature films, with a solid cast led by Lothaire Bluteau with August Schellenberg and Tantoo Cardinal in support. The presence of an Australian director, Bruce Beresford, perhaps kept the film from turning into a well-meaning but dry Canadian history lesson.",

There are brief tedious patches when Shahrukh Khan and Rani are not on screen but those are few and far between. The story is very everyday -boy meets girl, falls instantly in love and wooes successfully this girl who is bit out of his world. But the Shahrukh charm is such that one wonders how she could have contemplated even for a week the thought of marrying some other chap even if she knew him from childhood. Delightful wooing scenes, lovely songs, very charming and sexy marriage episodes followed by quarrels. These are so believable that the audience is left gasping at the audacity of the rows. Luckily a happy ending and one is left feeling good and satisfied. I shall be very disappointed if SRK does not win every award for this year&apos;s best acting. Cant wait to see other Shahrukh films due this year."

Once the film starts, you realize there is a lot going on, and there are many twists and turns that lead you to the ultimate ending of faith, belief, power, imagination, and an important story. Of course there are things that make many believe that this type of storyline is absurd, but from the beginning till when it all starts to reveal itself is a great intrigue, if not an obvious plot to turn to. If nothing else, Devour will reveal itself as an interesting turn of events in a mediocre world. Considering that this is a movie that isn&apos;t as shocking nor revealing as Saw or Land of the Dead it&apos;s worth a viewing since it was never released in theaters. It may not be the next Hitchcock, but there&apos;s a vibe to it that may make the many fans of this genre enjoy the originality!!",

      "reviewBody": "I first knew about this, Stan &amp; Ollie&apos;s first film after leaving the Hal Roach Studios, when reading Randy Skretvedt&apos;s book &quot;Laurel &amp; Hardy: The Magic Behind the Movies&quot;. He himself didn&apos;t have many complimentary things to say about it, noting that for the first time in his career, Stan Laurel had no creative control over the material, having been hired by 20th Century-Fox as actor only. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this the first time on VHS some 30 years ago and I still enjoy it now just watching it on YouTube. It&apos;s true that some of the characterizations of the Stan &amp; Ollie characters is somewhat violated-they speak a little faster this time around and the two actually do wisecracks, a rarity in their work, but they still provide some good laughs despite that like when Stan has to hide a pet crow and Ollie feels discomfort when Laurel finds one! And lone screenwriter Lou Breslow at least consulted Stan on the script which avoided even more violations of the team&apos;s characterizations, such as having them fight over a woman when the Laurel characterization was established as asexual! Breslow later denied that Great Guns was inspired by the success of Abbott &amp; Costello&apos;s Buck Privates but his initial script was revealed to have a dialogue scene that directly referenced that. (You can read what that sequence was like in my review of that A &amp; C flick). And cameraman Glen MacWilliams, an old friend of Ollie&apos;s, does the team no favors by discarding their usual white makeup. Still, I found much to enjoy in Great Guns. So that&apos;s a recommendation. P. S. Leading lady Sheila Ryan would return in L &amp; H&apos;s A-Haunting We Will Go as would Breslow and MacWilliams. And having now reviewed Breslow&apos;s L &amp; H movie, I will next review his contributions of that other comedy team&apos;s film, Bud Abbott &amp; Lou Costello in Hollywood.",

      "reviewBody": "What I find interesting about the prior reviewer is that he could only comment upon the sleaziness of the Jeremy Irons characters.  I fully expected to see that in most reviews.  It is also most unbalanced, in the manner of the sex role ideologies of the 90&apos;s and the oughts.\n\nFor any not submerged in feminist victimization ideology, or an exaggerated gallantry, but who can view the situation with a modicum of gender neutrality, the Binoche character is far more culpable than the Irons character.  She is no ingenue.  Her character must be around 30, and a very worldly 30 plus at that (although she looks 35 plus) -- to his perhaps 45. She plots from moment one to seduce her boyfriend&apos;s father, not long after she has hooked up with the boyfriend.  She does succeed soon enough, which does him no credit.  But he believes she is just one more of a long line of his son&apos;s very temporary, and not particularly involved sexual relationships -- and he exudes an obviously sexual loneliness.  The Irons and Binoche characters have a very torrid, and mildly S&amp;M, relationship.  All along he is obviously conflicted and very uncomfortable that she continue the relationship with both of them.  Midway, he wants to leave his wife, make an honest (if marriage destroying) breast of it, and be with her alone. Binoche wants no such thing.  She wants both father and son.\n\n What is really maximally warped is Brioche&apos;s continued pursuit of the father after the son has proposed marriage, after she has accepted, and after Irons tells her with obvious anguish, but apparent sincerity, that he has decided that he has to break it off, and is breaking it off.  It is not a mixed message.  He even makes a non-revelatory, but symbolic and emotionally communicative visit to his son in his new, early achieved job as assistant political editor at a tony London newspaper.  But Brioche relentlessly pursues him, and lures him back again -- while she is in the midst of planning the wedding.\n\nFurther, she spares not a single thought for his public career -- despite the fact that he is a British cabinet minister - or perhaps it is an assistant minister.  (She works in a high end antiques establishment). \n\n Sure, she has her troubled childhood history.  But even there it isn&apos;t clear whether she is more victim, or manipulator. Certainly she was not the most ultimate victim earlier, either. As well, the Irons character, for all his public success, also obviously has emotional issues.  They are familiar ones -- a reasonably pleasant, but passionless marriage, a midlife crisis, and a general sense, reflected by his children, that his greatest failing in life is not letting himself go more, not living with more passion.   He at least makes some efforts to control himself, and to distance himself after her intentions to commit herself (at least publicly) to his son become clear -- while she does not -- at all.\n\nHe of course ends up far more damaged by her than the other way around.  She it would seem entered damaged, and left with the pattern just more confirmed.  \n\nAnd yet as I expected, and have so far seen, the currently prevailing impulse is to almost exclusively blame the He -- regardless.   Hogwash. Brioche is the ultimate home wrecker."

      "reviewBody": "At first glance, &quot;The Stripper&quot; looks like eye candy: a cute young sideshow woman gets dumped by her manager and takes up with a local woman and her son, thereby developing a relationship with the son. But I do think that there was more to the movie than just that (if only a little more). In the lead role, Joanne Woodward gravitates between insecure and self-standing, not about to take from anyone. She does as good a job here as she did in &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot;. Claire Trevor also does quite well as the woman taking Woodward in, but many of the characters come across somewhat silly as teen rebels. It seemed to me like Richard Beymer was channeling his role as Tony from &quot;West Side Story&quot; (although Carol Lynley and Michael J. Pollard weren&apos;t bad).\n\nAnyway, &quot;The Stripper&quot; is a movie worth seeing. And if I may say so, Joanne Woodward was really hot in some of those clothes! Also starring Gypsy Rose Lee. I bet that no one imagined that director Franklin Schaffner would later direct the likes of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Patton&quot;, &quot;Papillon&quot; and &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot;.\n\nPS: Not that this really relates to anything, but right after I finished watching this movie last night, Joanne Woodward&apos;s husband Paul Newman was the guest on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;!",

A completely boredom of 115 minutes!\n\nMaybe this was considered as &quot;avantgarde&quot; in 1968, but I cannot really imagine that even then anybody had fun watching this except with a gun held at his head. An unnecessary and completely uninteresting movie that made the punk movement of the late seventies more than necessary!",

      "reviewBody": "1972&apos;s &quot;The Big Game&quot; (La Macchina della Violenza in Italy, Todesgrube von Gamma 03 in West Germany) is an international production featuring location shooting in Rome, Hong Kong, and South Africa, with a diverse cast of veterans in Stephen Boyd, Ray Milland, France Nuyen, and reliable Cameron Mitchell. Alternate titles &quot;Control Factor&quot; and &quot;Explosion&quot; are more descriptive than the silly original moniker (more suggestive of a Monday Night NFL matchup), based on a little known novel called &quot;The Two Sides&quot; by Ralph Anders, adapted by Anders, producer Stanley Norman, and director Robert Day. The MacGuffin for this rather dreary spy meller is a mind control computer device conceived by Milland&apos;s Professor Peter Handley (intended as a weapon of peace), which passes inspection before security team Leyton van Dyk (Stephen Boyd) and Bruno Carstens (Cameron Mitchell). Unfortunately, Handley&apos;s two sons inspire little confidence, Mark (Michael Kirner) of somewhat greater assistance than playboy Jim (Brendon Boone), just returned from Hong Kong after being captured and tortured by the enemy. He&apos;s an easily duped and obvious security risk in this too casual, drawn out setup, en route by ship to Cape Town when a band of masked machine gunners board and take over for a new destination. It&apos;s a long slog to reach the final two reels, which at least deliver long promised action, but audience interest proves difficult when Boone&apos;s total milksop is the main focus, and luscious France Nuyen vanishes from the film for such a long stretch (like Ray Milland, she hasn&apos;t much to work with). The most pleasant surprise is Mitchell being cast against type in a heroic role, easily outshining the top billed Boyd with an easygoing nature and predilection for practicing his golf swing aboard ship, even warding off an assassination attempt with a pillow!",

He&apos;s angry. He&apos;s looking for justice. Don&apos;t get in his way. The plot moves at a breakneck pace, and the length of the running time will probably go completely unnoticed because the direction looks so compact. This movie is over two hours long? I really have a hard time believing that. It just flies by, even though most of it happens in and around one location. With a build-up this exciting, the conclusion is usually a disappointment, but even that&apos;s not the case here. This is a rush of adrenaline captured on celluloid.",

In fact, I&apos;m pretty sure that the chicks in Cellblock 9 only (very) briefly keep their clothes on for like the opening scene. \n\nAnyhoo, this one&apos;s pretty nasty even by Senhor Franco&apos;s standards, and is chock full of misogyny, with some rather squirm inducing torture sequences to go with the bewbs and Franco&apos;s trademark lingering crotch shots. \n\nOne of the chicks in Cellblock 9, Susan Hemmingway, (At least I think it&apos;s her-she certainly looks young enough) was under 18 at the time of filming, which means it will never ever ever be accepted by the BBFC (British Board Of Film Classification) as she spends most of her screen time butt nekkid and chained, as well as getting down with three other chained and butt nekkid chicks. She also starred in Franco&apos;s Love Letters Of A Portuguese Nun, which I haven&apos;t seen, but am willing to bet isn&apos;t a dignified portrayal of a humble life of pious servitude in a convent. Cellblock 9 is also surprisingly down beat and grim, which puts it firmly in the category of totally and completely vile irredeemable filth which should not be viewed by anyone at all whatsoever, particularly chicks just released from prison. Best line: After thwarting an escape attempt by hawt chicks via fruit truck, a guard leers &quot;THIS is the type of fruit my men like!&quot; Awesome. \n\n7/10, delivers in what it sets out to do in spades, and fans of dirty nasty no-value-at-all-whatsoever Eurosleaze exploitation should check out this grimy little doozy.

      "reviewBody": "VIRGINIA CITY, the &quot;non-sequel&quot; to Errol Flynn&apos;s big 1939 hit, DODGE CITY, gives the impression that the Warner Brothers were suffering from a shortage of good Western scripts in 1940. The film &apos;borrows&apos; much of Max Steiner&apos;s DODGE CITY musical score, reunites Flynn with DODGE CITY costars (and friends) Alan Hale and Guinn &apos;Big Boy&apos; Williams (playing virtually the same characters, with different names), and attempts the visual &apos;sweep&apos; of DODGE CITY, in black and white, with a smaller budget. What is most memorable about the film, however, are two truly offbeat casting choices; Humphrey Bogart as a half-breed Mexican bandit, and tone-deaf Miriam Hopkins as a saloon singer. Bogart did NOT want to do the film (he felt himself miscast in westerns), but faced suspension if he didn&apos;t &apos;show up&apos; for work, and his unconvincing Mexican accent and forced performance give clear evidence to his unhappiness with the role. Hopkins, whose reputation had been established in pre-Production Code sex comedies and dramas of the early thirties, was, at 38, already past her prime, and unbelievable as a love interest for either Flynn, or Randolph Scott. As a &apos;sexy&apos; chanteuse, her singing is so incredibly bad that it must be heard to be believed!\n\nThe plot, of an undercover Union captain (Flynn) attempting to wrest a shipment of southern gold from a wagon train headed by the Confederate colonel (Scott) who had run the prison camp he&apos;d previously escaped from, gets bogged down in subplots, and, in trying to appease viewers from both sides of the Mason-Dixon line, makes everyone so noble that you wonder why there was a Civil War! Certainly, in Randolph Scott&apos;s case, the role wasn&apos;t much of a stretch, and would be one he would repeat frequently, with minor variations, for the next twenty years. Tasmanian Flynn, however, appears more comfortable in the Western genre than he had in DODGE CITY, and, after the on and off-screen battling with Bette Davis in his previous film, THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX, it must have felt like a vacation (even with hated director Michael Curtiz helming the project!)\n\nVIRGINIA CITY is, ultimately, a &apos;B&apos; movie with an &apos;A&apos;-list cast and crew, and while the end result isn&apos;t terrible, it isn&apos;t a film that either Flynn or Bogart would list as among their best efforts."

However, what this film tries to do is show the uniqueness of the man, not the artist. In this movie we see the man that invented &quot;pop art&quot; and helped to promote and inspire several young artists of the day, such as Basquiat. Perhaps Warhol did not have the artistic skills of a Norman Rockwell, but he did have the flair and eye for detail which few have ever possesed. This movie takes a somewhat friendly and well deserved look at the man and the artist. SAMO(c)",

The story concerns local hero Hung Lang, a kung fu supremo, who befriends a talking bird (of course) and is sent on a dangerous adventure to retain the sacred Dragon Blade from the mystically cavernous underworld known as Asteria, facing insurmountable peril along the way, in order to slain the Boar King, a giant pig-looking tyrant causing havoc in the town.

      "reviewBody": "Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas shared a chemistry -- offscreen as well as on screen -- which was rare even by Hollywood standards.  There&apos;s a legend about them, as a matter of fact (and I&apos;d hate to think it apocryphal), that -- at the onset of each of the many films in which they co-starred -- they flipped a coin to see who would play which role.\n\nIn their film adaptation of George Bernard Shaw&apos;s &quot;The Devil&apos;s Disciple,&quot; the coin-flip would have been at best symbolic -- or perhaps ironic is the term here -- inasmuch as the plotline concerns role reversals and identity switching.  Set during the closing days of the American revolution, Dick Dudgeon, the town rakehell (Douglas), having previously admitted to Reverend Anderson, the local minister (Lancaster), &quot;Pastor, there&apos;s something about you I respect, and that makes me want you for my enemy,&quot; allows himself to be mistakenly arrested as that minister by British troops.  It&apos;s an act which even he, at the time, is at a loss to explain.  While Dudgeon keeps the local British commandant, General Burgoyne (Laurence Olivier in what turns out to be one of his finer screen performances), alternately amused and bemused, Reverend Anderson discovers within himself a call to action as he rallies the rebel troops to rescue Dudgeon and to cut off Burgoyne&apos;s reinforcements.\n\nPurists may note that the film adaptation tampers with Shaw&apos;s more typically cynical resolution in the original stage presentation (yes, it is much more &apos;upbeat&apos; and true to the Hollywood dicta of the day) . . .  and yet the Shavian quality of the dialogue between Dudgeon and Anderson -- not to mention the barbed repartee between Dudgeon and Burgoyne -- is preserved virtually intact here.  It is also brilliantly rendered by all parties. \n\n Although Douglas manages to &apos;steal&apos; much of this film, Lancaster affords us more than a glimpse of the ability which will, in little more than another year, garner him an Oscar -- for &apos;Elmer Gantry&apos;-- (and put an end to the yearly ritual of his and Douglas&apos; comedic &quot;It&apos;s So Great Not To Be Nominated&quot; performance at the awards ceremonies).\n\nOne of Hollywood&apos;s more successful adaptations of a stage play, this is also a film which, more than most, stands the test of time."

      "reviewBody": "This was the fifth of the six Great films directed by Marcel Carne between 1937 &amp; 1945, again with writing collaboration from Jacques Prevert, and perhaps the most neglected. So much so I&apos;ve yet to see a good print, my latest one from French TV seems to have horses galloping (albeit softly) throughout the soundtrack while the film seems to have been bashed about a bit. Never mind; Carne&apos;s career was littered with excellent films but Visiteurs was one of his best - maybe it&apos;s best seen now without thinking of metaphorical allusions to the then resistance against the Nazis (except as a piece de resistance?) And the best was still a few years off: the utter magnificence of Les Enfants Du Paradis.\n\nFrance 1485: shady Gilles (square jawed Cuny) and Dominique (worldly wise Arletty) arrive at Baron Hugues castle as melancholic minstrels intent on disrupting the marriage preparations going on – as any self respecting devilish envoy would. Alas it goes awry for Gilles when he actually does fall in love with Anne the Baron&apos;s daughter (Dea) but Arletty manages to keep to her usual cynical straight and narrow course, and leads the Baron off his. It&apos;s beautifully photographed on black &amp; white nitrate film capturing atmospheric sunny days and romantic arc-moonlit nights, gorgeous costumes and fascinating sets equally well. One can almost smell the fresh air! One slight downer: the three midgets go from startling to plain irritating with their omnipresence. It&apos;s all about Love, Honour &amp; Purity poetically and elegantly related – which makes the denouement with the supposedly pure Anne and the for once nonplussed Devil so delightful and droll. Even if out of scope for him he should still have been able to guess that all&apos;s fair in love!\n\nRemember: the Devil will always find work for idle hands to do, including his own. Watch it for a thoughtful two hours of breath taking beauty strolling through a lost world as portrayed by another lost world. Next: Les Enfants Du Paradis.",

      "reviewBody": "The title is quite true. There is never a dull &apos;moment&apos; in this film, simply because the entire movie consists of 100 dull minutes. Van Dyke plays a bit-part actor who becomes entangled with gangster/mob type caricatures stealing a valuable painting, and other such dross. (On that note the film is about as lacklustre as the 1965 co-production &apos;Theft Of The Mona Lisa&apos;). The director seems to have been offered an entirely different script to the one offering the audience alleged &apos;comedy&apos;, which is regrettably confined to Van Dyke&apos;s &quot;unique&quot; brand of muggery (eg Lt Robinson Crusoe, 1966). \n\nEd G Robinsons presence is not even worth mentioning, in the hope that it can be overlooked in summation of his career&apos;s overall contribution to American movie history and development. \n\nAn inept, feeble-minded vomition of the sort of pap that elucidates any mystery surrounding why such a tycoon as Walt D should have ended up bankrupt."

There is something playful and quite outrageous about all three of the aforementioned movies with She Devil being the funniest due to great performances by the entire cast, even Roseanne Barr.  Although this movie was disregarded by most critics and ignored at the box office, it is truly a funny film with its cartoon-like situations and over-the-top characters.  Regardless of what everyone says, check out this film, especially when you find yourself in the mood for a cute and campy movie that is reminiscent of some of the great comedies of the 80&apos;s, such as Ruthless People.",

When in this one all appears to be shot in steady cam, the American way tries to put some melodramatic trigger.\n\nThis version is about feelings, about situation and personal change: life make us evolve like every decision we take and nothing is good or bad, there is a lot of in between. The chose to accumulate the short shootings, practically no music or just a few notes on one instrument,are trying to bring us along this day to day story really well interpreted. The characters in their flaws or every day basis are believable, there is not so much emphasis like in the good but too much American film. It&apos;s in their nature to modify, adjust the deepness of the movie and after seeing this 2004 version, we actually miss something: this authenticity.\n\nIn both versions, dialogs, ellipses are exactly the same, but characters turned out to be different. We actually have to exact opposite films and this is a real challenge to see both.",

They find a glowing alien ball called Bohdai and uninteresting stuff happens. Laughable to the extreme, with ugly-looking &apos;80s costumes and an odd fascination with rollerskating. It&apos;s unintentionally funny at times, and I totally give it points for that, but ultimately it&apos;s just embarrassing for all involved.

      "reviewBody": "Well, at least they tried.\n\nOne of the better aspects of &quot;Hyenas&quot; was the fact that they took the traditional werewolf cast mold, broke it and replaced it with hyenas. A bold move, and it might actually have worked, had they the CGI on their side. This approach was a much needed one, just a shame it failed.\n\nThe story told in &quot;Hyenas&quot;, well there were two stories actually, was pretty simple and easy to follow. The main story was the one with Gannon losing his family to the flesh-eating shape-shifting hyenas, then being sought out by Crazy Briggs, trained and then seeking revenge. That part of the story was actually decent enough. The other half of the story, the one with the two rivaling street gangs, well that was just unnecessary and very strained to look at. Those thugs came off nothing more than muppets trying to behave like street urchins. That part of the story should have stayed in the cutting room.\n\nAs for the CGI effects, well I am not much of a fan of cheesy effects, and &quot;Hyenas&quot; was one big cheese effect fest. From the glowing red eyes on the hyenas (as well as their hybrid and human forms) to the downright eyesore CGI animated hyenas running around. The movie truly did not have the effects on its side. And I think, if they actually had a bigger budget for the effects, the movie might actually just have proved much more cool and would have raised itself up from below mediocre value. And the actual shape-shifting scenes, well, you have to see that to believe it, and seriously, try not to laugh when you do.\n\nThe cast was a sorted bunch to say the least. I was a bit surprised to see Costas Mandylor (playing Gannon) in this movie. He went from the &quot;SAW&quot; movies to this? Alrighty then. But he did a good enough job in this movie, though he was better in &quot;SAW&quot;. Joshua Alba (playing Marco) was actually one of the guys putting on one of the better performances. I am not much of a fan of Christa Campbell, but wow, this performance was bad.\n\n&quot;Hyenas&quot; truly had potential, but it was hindered by its budget. The CGI effects really brought down the overall enjoyment of the movie. Plus some of the acting and dialogue also helped tripping the movie along the way. It is a shame, because it was refreshing to see hyenas take it on to the scene, trying to kick the werewolves from their pedestal. This movie could have worked out so well, but it wasn&apos;t just meant to be. I am rating this movie 3/10 because of the story and because it had potential, it was just hindered in its wake.",

Alas, what dire a task!\n\nCertainly, in the hands of an organisation as hard and dedicated as the SS it finally found a worthy pursuer. Quite interestingly Himmler doesn&apos;t seem to have been very preoccupied with the killing of Jews, he mentions that for about 10 seconds or so and reserves the rest of his speech for teaching his listeners how to radiate optimism, how to become a trusted player in the field of snitch compensation and generally how to address Russian generals, how to deal with SS trainees, how to resettle Germans, how to make examples of defeatists and so on.\n\nWell, that makes him a CEO, I guess. No really, listen to it! It&apos;s all about structural reforms, competitiveness and the right spirit. So far the formal aspects. In substance the most surprising thing is Himmler&apos;s lack of faith in the common German, who, for him, is some kind of whiny, overbearing and corrupt fool. Hence the need for the order as the harsh refuge of the uncorrupted to which no weakling ever had access.\n\nI am better than thou!\n\nI just wonder whether this kind of thing had a good psychological impact on the Wehrmacht. Himmler is a little, how to put this?, naive here, suggesting that Weapon-SS soldiers should pat their Wehrmacht buddies on the shoulder and say: &quot;Come on! Things are jolly good, you know?&quot; Brings us back to CEOs.\n\nAnyway, a highly interesting view into the center of evil, which, on examination, turns out to be a mixture of fantasy and irresponsibility.",

The background Music is also quite Appropriately Uncanny.\n\nBut the &quot;Star&quot; of the Movie is the Monster and for the few times It/She is on Screen there is some Tension and Gore that looks quite Bizarre. There are some glaring Missteps along the way, the kind that Corman never minded, at least in His Ultra Quickies. Like the Bumble Bees instead of Wasps Iconography, and the Guinea Pigs to Rats Mind Boggler. There are some others but Who cares?\n\nOverall, there is much Talk in this Thing and hardly Anyone moves in the Claustrophobic and Drab Sets, but there is enough Drive-In Movie Madness to make it Worth a Watch.",

This is a movie that is in the same genre as Porky&apos;s or Revenge of the Nerds. True fact, Tom Cruise said in a Playboy interview that he did this movie because of Jackie Earle Haley. Since Haley had been in Breaking Away, Cruise figured that this movie would be just as good. It didn&apos;t quite work out the way he expected, at least not right away. Cruise fan or not, it&apos;s worth a look. For me, Jackie pretty much steals every scene he&apos;s in. Anytime I watch this movie, I have to laugh at Tom Cruise because he ended up becoming one of the biggest stars in the movie world, and he started out in this. If you REALLY want to see Cruise in another light, check out Endless Love, with Brooke Shields. It&apos;s his first movie, and though he&apos;s in it for less than a minute, it&apos;s worth a look, just like Losin&apos; It. Check it out!"

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Never on Sunday&quot;, that charming Jules Dassin film, was shown unexpectedly on cable recently. The inspired story of a happy prostitute working the waterfront of Piraeus, was a smash hit everywhere when it first came out. Mr. Dassin&apos;s love poem to Greece, a land he loved, added another layer to his distinguished career. Not being known for light comedies, this movie strikes the right tone from the start. The director himself decided to play the pivotal role of Homer Thrace, a Brooklyn scholar familiar with Greek culture, but naive in matters of the heart and sex.\n\nIlya, a happy-go-lucky prostitute, is loved by the men working in the port. She has no hangups, something, that in contrast, Homer is full of. After all, he came from a society where sex was for the most part a taboo for the society he came from during the time period where the action takes place. After all, America was not a sexually liberated country. Ilya, on the other hand, was free to share her services openly, as she saw fit without any problem. In a way, the relationship that develops between Homer and Ilya, is a modified version of Pygmalion and Galatea, something that Homer was happy to undertake, even though he knew better not to try.\n\nMelina Mercouri dominates the film. She obviously enjoyed getting inside her character as it clearly shows on the screen. She gave a bigger than life reading in what was her best role in the movies. Ms. Mercouri&apos;s effortless performance wins the viewer right away because one realizes she is, like Fellini&apos;s Cabiria, a genuine soul that gives love without expecting anything in return.\n\nJules Dassin has been criticized by some contributors to IMDb by his take on Homer, but actually, he also gives an appealing account of his scholar. Not being an actor, he understood what he wanted to accomplish with this Brooklyn man that has spent most of his life around books, but not around real life, something he finds living among the earthy people around the Greek port where he spends his vacation. In fact, he kept reminding this viewer of this type of individual that is more at home among books than with real people.\n\nThe black and white cinematography of Jacques Natteau, enhances the film and the background in which it was filmed. Manos Hatzidakis&apos; delightful music score plays well in the story and it&apos;s never out of touch with what the director conceived. Ultimately, the film was another triumph for Jules Dassin, an American original whose body of work speak for itself.",

It&apos;s not intending to be a technical futuristic film with a huge budget. It&apos;s got a tiny budget for a Sci-fi genre film and the Direction and special fx for the period are perfect.\n\nDialogue is free-flowing and very much centricated on the main college friends and their new-found time-travelling friend who mysteriously appears from the future!\n\nThey obsess over the remote control after losing it in an accident. The friends decide that the only way to bring it back would be a time machine. Low and behold their wish comes true!\n\nFrom then it&apos;s a catalogue of time zones and continuum issues. The research done by the writer before is fabulous. It&apos;s logical and it ties-in. It&apos;s just so damn fresh and fun. It&apos;s not heavy and it&apos;s extremely light-hearted.\n\nFor a low-budget flick of the era it&apos;s aged incredibly well too. It doesn&apos;t need endless CGI as it has an exceptionally strong storyline. I really loved it and will be watching &apos;Beyond The Infinite Two Minutes&apos; by the same creator very soon. Amazing job!",

      "reviewBody": "A lot of humor at the expense of the Soviets (natch) is present throughout this musical version of &quot;Ninotchka&quot; in which Greta Garbo was the Russian who melts into a normal woman thanks to the spell of capitalism. Here it&apos;s CYD CHARISSE who plays the very uptight lady (with a stiffness that comes naturally to Cyd who could play an &quot;ice princess&quot; with the best of them). And FRED ASTAIRE is thankfully cast as an American film producer hoping to get her cooperation in borrowing a Soviet composer for his new film.\n\nThat&apos;s the nuts and bolts of the story, but the ingredients (including a trio of Soviet agents played by PETER LORRE, JULES MUNSHIN and Joseph BULOFF and a ditsy American singer/actress JANET PAIGE), are enough to stir up a lot of sardonic humor and some really good song and dance numbers. Paige is especially good with her &quot;Stereophonic Sound&quot; routine and &quot;Satin and Silk&quot;, flirtatious and vivacious as ever in a top supporting role.\n\nBut it&apos;s the dance elements that count here--Astaire at his most elegant and Cyd Charisse gracefully matching him step by step all the way through. Her performance as the serious minded miss who gradually bends to his ways is one of her better contributions to film comedy.\n\nSumming up: A delightful blend of Cole Porter songs and a clever script make this one a sheer pleasure, smooth as silk.",

It&apos;s not quite as good as the original but it still falls into that sweet spot of dark comedy, off-beat delivery and well acted performances. Smith and Jones are still spot on, the addition of Knoxville was very fun for me, Dawson adds a bit more warmth to the romantic interest than the dry wit of our mortician in the previous film and Boyle&apos;s portrayal of Serleena falls perfectly into the realm of weird but working that MIB is so good at.\n\nThe only reason I rate this one slightly lower than the original is because it doesn&apos;t quite hit me as hard as the first, doesn&apos;t resonate quite as much. There&apos;s nothing wrong, its just not quite at the same level of greatness.",

Next, if you&apos;re in a hurry or tired, wait until you&apos;re not. I almost deleted it because the marching band at the fort caught me on a migraine day. Instead, I kept it and waited till a rainy evening with no other plans. Perfect! I rarely laugh out loud when watching a film alone, but I laughed, hit rewind, and laughed again!! \n\nLancaster and Remick, with palpable chemistry, head a terrific cast that all looked liked they were having a blast! Yes, it was 30 minutes too long. During the sandstorm, go make popcorn. During the champagne bottles exploding everywhere scenes, go clean up the snacks. Other than that, don&apos;t watch this if you don&apos;t like satire, romance, and screwball westerns meant to bring women as well as men into the theater or, in modern times, to the TV screen. \n\nI hope this review reaches at least one viewer who will then stand with me:)",

I am a high school biology teacher and I show this film every year when we study viruses and bacteria. When I tell the students that it is a black and white film from 1935, I get moans and words of disapproval. But every year after they have viewed the film almost all students come away legitimately liking the film.\n\nPaul Muni&apos;s performance is extraordinary and may be the best performance of his entire career. I highly recommend watching this film. It was nominated for BEST PICTURE, Paul Muni won BEST LEAD ACTOR, it won BEST WRITER, and won BEST EDITING that year.",

Black and white and color, hope and desolation with an ensemble cast that it&apos;s as bizarre as it is extraordinary. Alberto Sordi, Melina Mercouri, Vittorio Gassman, Anouk Aimee, Jack Palance, Ernest Borgnine even Jimmy Durante and Renato Rascel. The interconnecting vignettes have an inexorable point of reference. The end of the world. The film, at times, appears to be a &quot;divertimento&quot; that builds to something apocalyptic and finishes in a hurried fizzling note, but it is in fact a superb exercise playing wittily with the fear of our ultimate and unavoidable demise. Among the many delights that the film offers there is a superlative performance by Alberto Sordi in one the most repellent characters in his long collection of repellent characters. A strange, funny, unsettling and fascinating film.",

The acting was excellent across the board and the story about the relationship of two school teachers and what transpires between them is involving. The problem for me was that in reading the reviews for the film I found that the reviewers revealed way too much about the plot. I found this to be one of those times when it was best to know as little as possible going in since there was a chance that knowing plot points might signal later revelations. Simply put the reviewers said too much so after a certain point it became clear what was going to happen, The result was that I enjoyed the film less than I might have other wise. Take my advice ignore what people say about the film and just see it",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s interesting to look through the negative reviews of The Man Who Would Be King. Those submitted twenty years ago reflect the range of subjective response you might expect from any film. Move forward to those submitted in the last few years and a common theme arises. The film is &quot;unwatchable&quot; because it portrays people in a colonial era with a colonial perspective. Somehow it&apos;s assumed that the writer casting forth this judgement somehow from birth knew all that is right and just and can, without a shred of arrogance or hypocrisy, see clearly the sins of the past and guide the rest of us as to what is correct and incorrect for us to allow our weak eyes and ears to take in or avoid so that we can also live a similarly enlightened life.\n\nSomeday I hope those who so arrogantly seek to cancel or at least condemn any film from an earlier era that did not by some miracle anticipate what would be politically correct in 2022 will gain some humility. Hopefully they will then finally come to recognize that they too suffer from the flawed human condition and are blind to what the next generation will someday condemn them for.\n\nIf you want to see how great filmmaking was done before digital technology made it easy to create any setting, this is a great film to watch. If you want to see how people viewed the world in the colonial era - and - of you want to understand how those who lived through the Great Depression and WWII sought to portray the colonial era, this is a great film to watch. It&apos;s also a well told story if you have the ability to follow a story that unfolds slowly and doesn&apos;t flash from one action scene to another.\n\nHowever, if you are like those who led the cultural revolution in China and believe that history must be eradicated or revised, I guess this is one of the cultural artifacts that must be destroyed. If that&apos;s you, I&apos;ll save you the time. You can add this to your censor list.",

I would recommend it to everyone and it sure would be wonderful to be able to see it on television or even better to have a copy on DVD or VHS. It is so sad that great movies like this are forgotten in lieu of action films of today that are all too often do NOT have a good story or acting! Most are full of foul language and sex scenes which are not at all necessary for a truly great film such as &quot;It Happened On Fifth Avenue&quot;. In summary this is a wonderful Family Film that will truly bring tears to your eyes."

When it first came out it was labeled as complete garbage and toilet humour. But to those people I say it is the best garbage and toilet humour you could ask for. What do you expect to see when the title of the film is &apos;&apos;Dumb and Dumber&apos;&apos;. The quick back and forth between the two lead actors and not so subtle chirping often goes unnoticed because your&apos;e laughing so hard from the previous scene.the jokes and dialogue are so good and Carey and Daniels deliver them with such authenticity. It&apos;s because of this reason that I am able to watch this movie countless times and still be entertained, as I listen to funny remarks that I missed on the previous 100 viewings. What&apos;s truly great about this film is that even people who say they hate it will always without fail crack a laugh or two when re-watching it. They just don&apos;t want to admit that they find this nonsense to be funny...but it is. More than 20 years later and I still have not seen a buddy comedy that comes close to matching it."

With the new job , they must change from a small city to the big town . Steve Martin ought to keep the familiar order involving in his own home while at the same time training the team .\n\nThe picture is pretty entertaining and amusing , the film contains bemusing scenes and continuous laughters and various chuckles with lots of fun . It&apos;s a new version of the classic film with similar title featured by Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy adding episodes from ¨Home Alone¨ as when Ashton Kutcher (uncredited) , being the Pier Perabo&apos;s boyfriend , suffers numerous jokes and misfortunes in charge of the brothers , likeness to thieves from former film . The picture belongs to numerous family sub-genre whose maxim representation is ¨Yours , mine and ours¨ with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball and recently remade with Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo . Steve Martin , as always , plays as excessive manner , making an authentic recital , if you like Martin&apos;s crazy interpretation , you&apos;ll enjoy this one . Besides , there appears as sons , known and young actors as Tom Welling (Smallville) , Hilary Duff (LizzyMcGuire) , Piper Perabo (Bar Coyote) and Ashton Kutcher(Guess) .

      "reviewBody": "IL MARE (2001) Another soapy time-travel romance that, if you watch it in the right frame of mind, could have you in tears. It&apos;s about a guy who finds a letter in the mailbox of his new seaside rental house from the previous tenant advising him about little things that haven&apos;t happened yet, like the paw prints his dog leaves on the floor days later! In trying to meet the woman who wrote the letter, he comes to realize she lives about a year or two ahead of him in the timeline, and lived in the house after he vacated it. He asks her to find him in the future, but she can&apos;t... Like DITTO, the film manages to defy conventions on a couple of occasions, and it&apos;s internal logic is solid enough that you don&apos;t think about it too hard. Another great date film, again provided you&apos;re not too cynical about such things. I give it a 9."

The four lead performances are all good, but Jean Rochefort in particular does a brilliant dead-pan in the lead role. There are plenty of good lines, but the funniest jokes are visual- the synchronising of the push-chair gently bumping the car with the noise of the crash behind, or the re-appearance of the parrot behind Madame Maynard. And Patachou&apos;s cameo in that role (the mother, not the parrot) makes the movie worth seeing alone. Highly recommended, and worth seeing twice for the subtle jokes you miss the first time. And if you&apos;re wondering: yes, Guilliame Depardieu does have his father&apos;s nose.",

      "reviewBody": "It is actually a bit of a testament to Michael Caine&apos;s charisma, that I didn&apos;t give this one star. As a Scot, I ought to have hated it. Oddly enough, though, it&apos;s not awful. Sure, his accent is all over the place but somehow the thrust of the story is reasonably handled. It all starts with &quot;David Balfour&quot; (Lawrence Douglas) trekking to his uncle &quot;Ebenezer&quot; (Donald Pleasance) to tell him his father has passed away. The venal old gent has no intention of sharing his meagre fortune and soon &quot;Davie&quot; in underway across the sea under the guidance of &quot;Capt. Hoseason&quot; (Jack Hawkins). That ship hits a smaller one which introduces us to the Jacobite, tartan-clad, Caine (&quot;Alan Breck Stewart&quot;) who is on the run from King George&apos;s red coats. After literally having to fight their way off the brig they have some adventures, get caught up in an high level assassination and end up with both trying to achieve their objectives against the odds. The production is pleasing to look like, and the score sets up some lovely Scottish location photography. The cast? Well, Hawkins looks like he has had way too much port; Trevor Howard is quite effective as the duplicitous Lord Advocate and the young Douglas does fine as the naive but decent young &quot;Balfour&quot;. It is all about Michael Caine, though - and for all it&apos;s many flaws, there is no denying that the solid underpinning adventure story serves as a strong enough bedrock for this not to end up the laughable nonsense it could have been. Not a patch on the Disney version from 1959, but I didn&apos;t hate it...",

      "reviewBody": "Angel and the Badman is written and directed by James Edward Grant. It stars John Wayne, Gail Russell, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Irene Rich, Lee Dixon and Stephen Grant. Music is by Richard Hageman and cinematography by Archie J. Stout.\n\nQuirt Evans (Wayne), a notorious gunman is hurt and on the run. Taken in by The Worth&apos;s, a Quaker family, Quirt forms a &quot;special&quot; bond with daughter Penelope (Russell). With the law and other badmen on his tail, will Quirt change his ways before it&apos;s too late? \n\nJohn Wayne&apos;s first film as a producer and star is also his most romantic. That&apos;s not to say it lacks action or Wayne&apos;s fine tuning of his macho image is halted, because that&apos;s not the case, but this carries a dreamy like old fashioned value that has helped the film endear over the years. It&apos;s a touch too slow at times for its own good and runs for ten minutes longer than was needed, things that no doubt stunted its financial growth at the 1947 box office, but there is much to enjoy here.\n\nTechnical values are high, from Stout&apos;s photography that beautifully realises locations in Sedona, Arizona (Monument Valley standing out, naturally!), to cast performances from Carey, Wayne and the gorgeous Miss Russell (chemistry unbound between the three actors), film never lacks for quality. Memorable scenes are plenty, such as The Duke sitting in a chair facing down three henchmen led by Cabot&apos;s Laredo Stevens; his gun empty, a free-for-all punch up in a saloon, and some very tender moments between Wayne and Russell. While narratively there&apos;s the deft pitching of Quaker values into a wild west setting.\n\nA lovely film which also manages to pump the adrenaline as well. 7.5/10\n\nDVD version viewed was Region 2 taken out of the John Wayne Out West 6 film Box Set. A good quality black and white print.",

      "reviewBody": "When the &quot;favela reality&quot; movies seem to be running out of &apos;ideas&apos; - trying to profit by copying the acclaimed &quot;City of God&quot; over and over -, director José Padilha (of the equally engrossing documentary &quot;Bus 174&quot;) brings us &quot;Tropa de Elite&quot; (&quot;Elite Squad&quot;), the most controversial Brazilian film in a long time, having sold millions of pirated DVD copies even before its theatrical release (and still managed to become the biggest Brazilian movie event of 2007).\n\n&quot;Elite Squad&quot; shows the routine of a group of cops in Rio de Janeiro, and the inhumane training they have to go through in order to become a BOPE (Special Police Operation Battalion) captain, the policemen who are supposed to fight drug trafficking, in the rawest possible way. Wagner Moura (&quot;God Is Brazilian&quot;), one of the most versatile Brazilian actors of his generation, delivers a bravura performance as Captain Nascimento, who wants to quit his job in order to dedicate himself to his newly-born son, but has an important mission before that: finding the right replacement. \n\n&quot;Elite Squad&quot; is not as stylized or visually compelling as Fernando Meirelles/Kátia Lund&apos;s &quot;City of God&quot; (the comparison is inevitable), but that&apos;s not a flaw. The movie is violent but realistic, far from sheer Hollywood gore-fest (i.e. Scorsese&apos;s over-hyped &quot;The Departed&quot;), and offers some extremely provocative discussions about Brazil&apos;s social chaos - and also a disarmingly blunt, love it or hate it narration. Surprise winner of the Golden Bear at the 2008 Berlin Film Festival (competing with other strong titles, including Paul Thomas Anderson&apos;s brilliant &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;), &quot;Elite Squad&quot; is a must-see. 10/10."

The film opens with a scene in which squatters are forcibly evicted from a derelict building.  Londoner viewers will recognize this as a sad yet common event... Immediately, we are attuned to the political bent of the movie. Fortunately for that intent, the dialogue in the film is intelligently written (note: this will not appeal to the lowest common denominator -- it scores low on commercial appeal).  Unfortunately, the often &quot;stiff&quot; delivery of that dialogue is a significant impediment.  That said, Daniel Day Lewis lends a powerful presence to his role as the punk squatter, Johnny.\n\nThe climax of the film aptly integrates the various tensions in the film: political, sexual, and social.  We&apos;re surprised with a love scene between Johnny and Omar which is well-paced, erotic, and genuine."

The story is a simple one about two men (William Powell, Clark Gable) who grew up together but are on opposite sides of the law. Myrna Loy also stars as the woman initially with Blackie (Gable) who falls for and marries Jim (Powell). Great director and trio of stars with fantastic chemistry elevate this above otherwise banal plot. Young Blackie is played by, of all people, Mickey Rooney! Must&apos;ve been one hell of a puberty. Also of note is the song &quot;The Bad in Every Man,&quot; sung by Shirley Ross here. The song would later be given new lyrics by Lorenz Hart and become the classic standard &quot;Blue Moon.&quot;",

The classic book On The Beach correctly has that as done by Cobalt Bombs, as does Doctor Strangelove.\n\nSince Friendship could easily prove her non-human nature, and even drinks impossible amounts of alcohol to prove it, why not contact the US Embassy and be taken to MIT or the UN?\n\nIt is absurd to think that she would be mistreated. She represents an entire alien civilisation with superior technology.\n\nAll the talk about Palestinians and Israel misses the basic point - a widespread Jewish view that the whole land should be Jewish. Plus a failure by Palestinians to agree to something like the Oslo Agreement when they still have the Soviet Union there to balance the USA.\n\nThere area few comic remarks about machines.

      "reviewBody": "Perhaps best known nowadays as the film that inspired Blake Edwards to write and direct the amusing &apos;Switch&apos; with Ellen Barkin, this earlier comedy features the same idea of a shameless philanderer reincarnated in the body of a woman. Clocking in at close to two hours, &apos;Goodbye Charlie&apos; takes an incredibly long time to warm up with over 25 minutes elapsing before the comedy really kicks in since the philanderer (in the woman&apos;s body) has amnesia at first. Once the film gets into the swing of things though, it is a decent ride. Debbie Reynolds does well acting tough and manly, casually ogling other women and so on. It is not as dynamic a performance as Barkin in &apos;Switch&apos; (who nailed the mannerisms of her male self) as we never actually see much of Charlie before he is killed, but Reynolds is still dynamite. There are also several fascinating moments as he/she gets more used to being a woman, even allowing him/herself to be seduced. Additionally, in a daring move, he/she even tries to seduce his/her best friend, played by Tony Curtis. Speaking of which, Curtis does well with a tricky role here. At times, it seems like he is also about to fall for his macho best friend in a lady&apos;s body. The experience is let down by a tacked-on cop-out ending that fails to capitalise on all this sexual tension, but the film pokes enough at gender identity issues to remain interesting.",

His big personality as the lumber tycoon helps distract from certain paunchy shortcomings as a screen lover. Seeing him in passion clinches with a nubile young Farmer takes some getting used to. Happily, Farmer also shines, especially in the saloon girl part, before giving way to a more routine turn as the daughter.\n\nAccording to film historian David Thomson, Farmer&apos;s performance was affected by Hawks&apos; replacement by Wyler as director. Apparently, she and Hawks were more than sympatico off the set. So, Thomson&apos;s account goes, Hawks brought on writer Furthman to slant the film towards his beauteous blonde, thus causing novelist Ferber to complain to head honcho Goldwyn, resulting in Hawks&apos; departure and a feud between Farmer and Wyler. I mention these behind-the-scenes shenanigans to maybe account for some of the plot&apos;s half-digested elements and Farmer&apos;s noticeable downturn.\n\nNonetheless, it&apos;s still a compelling movie, thanks mainly to Arnold&apos;s dominating presence that holds the various threads together. I also like the logging footage, which lends a dramatically realistic air to Glasgow&apos;s empire. Then there&apos;s Lotta&apos;s haunting rendition of &quot;Aura Lee&quot;, which evidently Farmer herself crooned. However, I&apos;m still trying to figure out the title that appears to have little resemblance to the storyline. But however you cut that or the purported intrigues, it&apos;s still a dynamic movie."

      "reviewBody": "As the title suggests, this is a Snuff version of classic I Spit On Your Grave. Three chicks get tortured, until one of them escapes, and kills the main villain. There&apos;s also a side plot to this film, that the chick that escaped did a investigation on the suspect, that did his mass-murders.\n\nI&apos;m going to be brutal honest here, when it comes to fictional Snuff-Movies, this one is probably the tamest i have seen, which was really a let down. Comparing this to Guinea Pig, Grotesque, Altroz and The Butcher, it&apos;s safe to say that Snuff 102 has no weight to the fictional snuff movies i have listed and seen.\n\nThe main problem i got with this film, is how boring it was. The whole movie was so slow, and repetitive, half of the scenes could of been cut out in order for this film to flow better. Until the last 20 minutes, everything else in this movie was painfully boring, and i could not wait for it to end. I have to mention, this movie does contain scenes of some real death gore scenes, one of which is where they slaughter a pig in Croatia, and they present is as snuff, which is understand why, is to compare the human body to a pig, for Snuff killers, the victims body is just like a Pig.\n\nThe movie is trying to prove a point, that Snuff-filming is just equal as Pornography, in the sence, that the human body is being exploitated and humiliated, and that there&apos;s no limits on the internet, that you can be perversed as you wish on the internet.\n\nThis movie could of been way better, if we had more likeable victims, that had any kind of backstory, the only one that has a flat barely exsisting backstory and development, is the chick that is investigating this guy. Sad to say but hour and twenty minutes of this was so boring, and you barely cared really. Yes the movie has some graphic scenes, if you never watched a fictional snuff flick, this probably could move you ill, however if you are somebody that is a veteran to extreme cinema, it&apos;s probably not going to bother you, and most of the effects look really cheap, and all of it is blacked out, probably because the budget was not there.\n\nThe only thing keeping this film at two stars, is the fact that it has a plot, because there&apos;s movies out there that nearly have zero plot, and are just a brain melter, like Gummo, Where The Dead Go To Die, and Begotten.",

So, full of expectations, I started to watch the movie. The actors are good, the atmosphere reminds me of the book - and there it ends. The plot is something else entirely - so loosely based on the marvelous novel it falls completely through. Fifteen minutes in the movie and it already goes off on a tangent, in an entirely different direction. Some characters are from the book, some aren&apos;t. Even the ones that are in the book have suddenly a different agenda. An incredibly bad movie in itself, an incoherent story where not even a sparkle from Mark Twain&apos;s genius shines through. Why, why would somebody think that he or she can rewrite one of the most wonderful stories of all times???",

      "reviewBody": "It was thirteen years ago that Ron Howard&apos;s ode to firefighters hit theaters with 1991&apos;s Backdraft. This was before Howard went on to direct such popular fare as Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind. This was before Kurt Russell figured that Captain Ron might a good idea, and most importantly, this was before September 11, 2001.\n\nTo say that our impression of firefighters changed that day sounds, well, awkward. Firefighters have always been held in high regard. They run into burning buildings while everyone else is running out. They put their lives on the line to save others. It is a courage that most of us would like to think we have, but few of us are ever put into a position to test.\n\nOn September 11, we watched in awe as the buildings collapsed and 340 firefighters were taken from us prematurely. Although the loss of lives that day included thousands of innocents, we warmed to our heroes and it brought their efforts and incredible bravado back to our attention. Immediately after the tragic events, it was not uncommon to see people wave or salute firefighters in the most remote regions of our country. On CNN we began to hear stories of the personal lives of these men. Their support. Their sacrifices.\n\nIt is not surprising therefore that our newly energized interest was translated into big screen emotional powerhouses. In 2002, Anthony LaPaglia and Sigourney Weaver played a firefighter and a writer to prepare eulogies for those fallen in the attacks in The Guys. Now, in 2004, red-hot Joaquin Pheonix and John Travolta have teamed up to bring us the highly effective Ladder 49. \n\nLadder 49 starts with a fire in a large Baltimore factory where multiple firemen have charged to look for survivors and extinguish the posing threat.\n\nLead by seasoned veteran Jack Morrison (Pheonix), the firemen are able to rescue a helpless employee before the floor gives way trapping Morrison within the building inferno. As Jack lays there helpless awaiting the rescue from his peers, we are sent back in time via the Hollywood standard flashback to understand what brought Jack to his present peril. We see Jack as he enters the fire hall for the first time and meets Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) who takes the new probie under his wing and over the years develops a bond that includes being there when Jack gets married, has kids and steps into the shoes of a search and rescue firefighter who perishes when a roof gives way during a routine house fire. We learn how the firemen bond, how they drink together rather heavily and regularly and how when they lose one of their own, the emotional impact on them and their families\n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong, all the above drama plays out while buildings burn, people are rescued from skyscrapers and people are saved from what would be sheer death if not for the charging brave souls of the local Fire Department. There is enough action to keep the younger audiences looking for the quick rush occupied while enough firemen running around in tight t-shirts to keep the women equally transfixed. \n\nBut it is the story that sets this film apart from any other firefighting film in memory. We get a good glimpse into the lives of the men and portrait of a young man learning the ropes and growing within the culture and environment that can be sometimes loose and playful only to become serious and deadly at the sound of a bell. Director Jay Russell (My Dog Skip) packs an emotional punch that doesn&apos;t try and suck it out of the audience with an unexpected end. Instead, we see Jack being trapped in the opening sequence and we can pretty much see the writing on the wall before the tragic events play out before our eyes.\n\nFor all the focus played to the rising star Pheonix, it is the supporting cast that really stands out within the confines of the 105 minute running time. Travolta seems comfortable in playing a supporting role and is effective and powerful in his portrayal as the Captain of an efficiently run firehouse. Also standing above the average fare is Jacinda Barrett who plays Jacks wife. Yet another beautiful Australian actress, Barrett has the largest load in the film as the anchor that questions why her husband and father of her children would risk his lives for others ignoring his own well being. She both shows anxiety and support in her understanding of his passion and it is her strength that gives the film its heart.\n\nTo compare Ladder 49 to Backdraft would be unfair. Backdraft did little to bolster our impression of the firefighting community while Ladder 49 shows them for what they deserve to be recognized as  heroes who at the sound of an alarm will put themselves in harms way to help others.",

      "reviewBody": "While less isn&apos;t always more, the makers of &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; resisted the temptation to pad it out from its shorthand running time, meaning it goes by quickly and painlessly. Not that the actual plot of this followup to the original charmer is hard to take in itself (Stuart is starting to feel a bit left out, and when Margalo the wren literally drops into his life he gets a new dimension).\n\nIn terms of technical levels it&apos;s only slightly easier to fault (Margalo looks a bit too cartoonish to be real, unlike Stuart Little himself and the falcon that&apos;s the movie&apos;s villain - but then again, Melanie Griffith [the voice of Margalo] always seems like a cartoon anyway), but the story by screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin and the movie&apos;s producer Douglas Wick is what makes this ultimately inferior to its predecessor; what helped drive &quot;Stuart Little&quot; was our hero&apos;s wish to be accepted by his human brother and by the cat - sneer all you want, but the family message was hard to ignore. For the sequel it&apos;s more standard - the friend who&apos;s acting out of ulterior motives at first but then turns out to be a real friend, etc. Stuart isn&apos;t so much the protagonist this time, and it hurts a little.\n\nSo the freshness is reduced, but this still isn&apos;t stale - the charm and humour of the first movie remains, Michael J. Fox and Nathan Lane are as adept as ever as Stuart and Snowbell (&quot;This better be important.&quot; &quot;Margalo is missing.&quot; &quot;I&apos;d better be more specific - I meant important to ME.&quot;), and the human Littles remain just right - loving but not without making you want to slit your own throats. HBO Family has recently aired an animated version with all the principals except Hugh Laurie absent - it&apos;ll have to go a long way to live up to the two movies. (In-joke for score fans: Alan Silvestri slips in a quote from his &quot;Back to the Future&quot; theme in the climax.)\n\nBut I can see why this didn&apos;t do as well at the box-office as it should have - having a soccer match plus including Gilbert O&apos;Sullivan AND Celine Dion on the soundtrack was asking for trouble..."

      "reviewBody": "Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer (1993)\n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nGood documentary from Nick Broomfield has the filmmaker trying to secure an interview with Aileen Wuornos, the Florida woman convicted of killing seven men as she was working as a prostitute. The story became (wrongly) known as the first female serial killer but the filmmaker quickly learns that those around here supposedly looking after her best interest are actually just trying to milk money from the case. This includes her lawyer Steve Glazer as well as Arlene Pralle, the woman who adopted Wuornos soon after she was arrested. This is a pretty fascinating documentary on many levels and I do wonder if Broomfield&apos;s original intent was just to make a documentary on Wuornos and then while doing it he discovered how others were just using her to make money for themselves. While there&apos;s a quick interview with Wuornos at the end of the documentary, the main focus here is the lawyer as well as the adopted mother. Right from the start you can tell that there&apos;s something really wrong with these people and especially when they make Wuornos change her pleas simply because of coming clean to God and going home. This is just the start of things because Broomfield soon uncovers that perhaps even the police are in on this just so they could get movie deals. I really liked the way Broomfield interviewed both parties on their connections to the case and it was really fascinating that no one could see through this lawyer while all the court stuff was going on. Now, I&apos;m not going to sit here and say that Wuornos didn&apos;t get what she deserved for her crimes but at the same time those around her shouldn&apos;t have been benefiting from her case, life and eventual death."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Die fliegende Windmühle&quot; (=&quot;The flying windmill&quot;) must be my favorite animated movie. Partly, I blame this on the fact that I grew up in East Germany. Among a certain group of former East Germans who are now (i.e., 2003) moving into their mid-twenties or early thirties, this film constitutes their childhood and has gained a cult status.\n\nOlli, the main character in the movie, got a very bad grade (a 5, which equals an F) and is terribly annoyed. She runs away from home and, together with a dog and a horse, finds a (mad? nutty?) scientist in a windmill. They experience the strangest adventures in this windmill and find other interesting characters, a lot of excitement and peril.\n\nWhile you may well interpret something as the &quot;socialist value system&quot; into this movie, it is more meant to be a children&apos;s movie, showing the kids that there are more exciting things out there than the ones that your parents and teachers show you, and that you will only find out most of those things on your own, if you show enough curiosity. Personally I think that this is a wonderful contradiction to the common concept that only your school grades make you a better person.\n\nThe East German DEFA film studios produced a considerable number of amazing children&apos;s films (among them the almost-legendary &quot;Sandmännchen&quot;, which is a little manikin generously spreading &quot;sleeping sand&quot; in a nightly tv show to send the children to bed), this being one of the most beautiful ones.\n\nI give this film a full ten, mainly because it&apos;s both fun to watch for children and adults; it&apos;s entertaining, funny and terribly cute.",

      "description": "Filmmakers Dietmar Post &amp; Lucia Palacios are the equivalent to the American music film icons DA Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus. With their award-winning film &quot;The Transatlantic Feedback&quot; they were responsible for the rediscovery of the 60s cult band &quot;monks&quot;. This time they portrait the Klangbad Festival, which is curated by Hans Joachim Irmler, founding member of the legendary krautrock band Faust. This DVD includes two films: &quot;Faust: Live at Klangbad Festival&quot; was released in 2010 by Play Loud Productions Berlin, paired up with &quot;Klangbad - Avant-garde in the Meadows&quot;, a documentary of the Klangbad festival itself. &quot;The Faust performance film, featuring the band led by Jochen Irmler and Arnulf Meifert, ranges from structured rock to spaced abstractions, industrial soundscapes to acid drenched fuzz-jazz. Stephen Wray Lobdell&apos;s multi-textured guitar talents are literally mind blowing. Both films together make for perhaps the ultimate documentation of the Faust musical experience and the legacy they have engendered within the experimental genre. This 2for1 package may be one of the best &quot;experimental music&quot; productions of the decade&quot;. (review eurock) ",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Daughters of Satan&quot; is a cheesy but fun piece of low-budget occult Horror starring 27-year-old Tom Selleck in his first leading role. Directed by Hollingsworth Morse (nice name, buddy), &quot;Daughters of Satan&quot; was obviously shot on a very low budget, and while the plot is cheesy and messy and often lacks logic, the film is undeniably entertaining. Selleck plays the American arts expert James Robinson, who has recently moved to the Phillipines with his beautiful wife Christina (Barra Grant). In an obscure art gallery, he stumbles across a painting which shows a witch-burning in 1592 Spain. And one of the burned witches happens to be the spitting image of his wife! Fascinated with the coincidence, he buys the painting and brings it home; henceforth, mysterious things begin to happen... As mentioned above, logic isn&apos;t the strongest point of the film (why would anyone keep the painting when it&apos;s clear that it&apos;s causing trouble), and the plot is often messy. Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable film that might appeal to many of my fellow fans of low-budget Horror and Exploitation. There are some really cool scenes, in particular the sleazy opening sequence, and one fantastic creepy scene involving a painting, which I don&apos;t want to give away. Interestingly, Selleck&apos;s role here has some resemblance to the role of Magnum P.I., for which he would later get famous. Barra Grant, who plays his wife, has a very presentable rack, and the film includes a variety of eccentric characters. You haven&apos;t missed anything if you decide to skip &quot;Daughters of Satan&quot;. However, it is definitely entertaining, and a film that most of my fellow fans of B-Movies and low-budget Horror in particular might enjoy.",

      "reviewBody": "Herzog&apos;s work may lend itself to interpretation more than most. And while it may just be a quibble of emphasis, I would not, as the other two reviewers here have, say this is essentially a documentary about &apos;capital punishment&apos;. Just as I would not say &quot;grizzly man&quot; was really a documentary about bear attacks. Herzog lets it be known he doesn&apos;t approve of the death penalty, but mostly, like most Herzog documentaries, this just struck me as a portrait of (as another reviewer put it well) the &quot;ill-fated&quot;.\n\nCertainly, if you go into this thinking you&apos;re going to get Michael Moore style anti-death penalty agitprop, you&apos;re going to be disappointed. This is a series of interviews with a Texas death row inmate scheduled for imminent execution (an inmate Herzog has characterized in interviews as a &quot;truly frightening&quot; human being) and the lives of some of those either the case, or the Texas Death Penalty system generally, have touched upon. It is probably the least sensationalistic account of its sort put on film. And for that alone, Herzog deserves praise. \n\nHaving lived in Houston for many years and knowing this area just north of it pretty well, I can say Herzog is able convey a lot about the area and its people, through the lens of this horrific act, very well.\n\nWell, once more, what is it about, if not capital punishment.... I think Herzog in a related context (his &quot;On Death Row&quot; documentary series) may have put it best when an attorney he was interviewing noted &apos;we all have a need to humanize&apos; and rationalize these people who have done terrible things, and Herzog stopped them to say &quot;I don&apos;t humanize them. I don&apos;t want to humanize. They simply are human beings&quot;. And that&apos;s kind of how I saw &apos;into the abyss&apos;. It&apos;s not an attempt to rationalize or humanize a triple-murderer, nor is it an attempt rationalize, demonize, or humanize state sanctioned execution. It&apos;s just portrait of a piece of life as it is now lived.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The film reveals how and why a supposedly revolutionary Italian girl has in fact fallen prey to bourgeois ideology&quot;. By this plot synopsis I was expecting a film where Godard and his friends in Maoism call into question the conceit of being a revolutionary from a safe distance, in a complacent society.\n\nThat&apos;s not quite so, probably because at this point Godard saw no conceit in his chosen political milieu. It wouldn&apos;t be until a few years later in Ici et Ailleurs when he&apos;d begin to re-examine that belief and his involvement in it.\n\nIn Lotte in Italia, it&apos;s not the conceit of being revolutionary from a safe distance that is analyzed but the problem of it, the conundrum of how the two can be combined in one social position. In the first part of the film we see the girl trying to formulate or conform to the political rhetoric expected from a communist as capitalist society around her provides for her. In the second part the problem is outlined, then Godard offers solutions, thinking for example not in terms of food or clothes but the production of them, not in terms of money but labour.\n\nWhat worries Godard here, as with other films of the period, what he&apos;s preoccupied with, is deeply esoteric for communism. He simply devises in film ways to express the concerns of every other communist of the time. The liberation for him in this Maoist phase, as it were, is that he has a reason to keep making his art. He finds a cause not in some inner personal turmoil, but in the greater turmoil of the world. As such, I sense very little personal attachment, no expression that comes from the soul.\n\nIn my ongoing Godard quest, what fascinates me the most is not any individual film but the struggle for expression, being able to chart the creative ebbs and lows and the evolution of an artistic voice and does a chronicle unfold. Here, I find a talented film mind working beneath his abilities, operating under the assumption that he&apos;s lending those talents in the service of those important, imminent, changes in the world he presaged in Week End.\n\nThe thing that intrigues me the most then is this sense of dichotomy I get from Godard, between a feverish intellectual who places too much importance in cinema to completely abandon it and a satisfied bourgeois who really has little incentive to keep making it. At this point at least he had found a cause, now I&apos;m setting my eyes on the time when he abandoned it."

      "reviewBody": "Incredible central performance from Javier Bardem ties the film together and makes you really care what happens. Great supporting players: Sean Penn has one incredible scene early on, who had us convinced he was Cuban. We didn&apos;t at all recognise him. Johnny Depp plays two small parts, but two very memorable ones. Growly-voiced Michael Wincott (played the bad guy in The Crow and Along Came a Spider and The Doors&apos; manager in The Doors) is memorable. Andrea di Stefano is great as a central antagonist of Reinaldo, as is the now-Hollywood-famous Olivier Martinez who plays a touching, platonic friend to Reinaldo.\n\nBeautifully photographed and directed in an admirable manner that draws attention to style every now and then in a poetic way very fitting for a bio-pic about a poet, and at other times just utilises style to tells the story very well, and seem not to be fussing about style at all.\n\nThere are scenes here where the sound effects track stops and this gorgeous cello music by Carter Burwell (composer of Being John Malkovich, Meet Joe Black, Man who Wasn&apos;t There, with another beautiful score) plays while we watch Bardem sitting in a club while people dance around him, and the music tells us he is far away. It is a wonderful scene, akin to Kurosawa&apos;s use of music in the brilliant burning of the first castle scene in Ran.\n\nThe way the camera tells this story was so marvellous and slick (though using rough camera work to tell moments of uneasiness, importantly this is not over-used as it was in the recent Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) that i knew the filmmaker had been influenced by American filmmaking, but throughout i had no idea the guy actually WAS American! The TV program misleadingly told us it was a Cuban movie (which it is not - it is an American production with Spanish, Cuban and American actors)\n\nI&apos;m even more shocked considering this is the guy who made Basquiat, which i always thought was more a tele-movie, and more about art than about movie-style. Julian Schnabel, i now learn, was a neo-expressionist painter in the 80&apos;s! Basquiat, about an artist, perhaps was a movie where he was making the transition between art-language and movie-language. Before Night Falls uses traditional storytelling, to be sure, but it has such a spellbinding cinematic quality i felt sure its director was one with cinema on the brain. Perhaps Schnabel has caught the bug after all.",

It continues the &apos;new Hong Kong&apos; visual style (strobe, overexposure, freeze-frames, and jump-cutting) that fellow director Wong-Kar Wai has pioneered in his last three films.  In addition to superb cinematography and editing, the storyline also is exceptional, taking the viewer into the harsh realities of Hong Kong youth gangs.  Autumn Moon, the main character, is a rare creation - both attractive and repulsive.  The moment we begin to empathize with him, he pushes us away with his enormous capacity for violence.  This perfect mix of tenderness and harshness push it head and shoulders above most Hong Kong cinema, not only of 1997, but of any other year as well.",

      "reviewBody": "Best Seller is directed by John Flynn and written by Larry Cohen. It stars James Woods, Brian Dennehy and Victoria Tennant. Music is by Jay Ferguson and cinematography by Fred Murphy. \n\nCop Dennis Meechum (Dennehy) survives being shot during a robbery at the police evidence storage and writes a well received book about the events. Years later he&apos;s widowed, raising his daughter on his own and suffering from writers block as he tries to write another novel. Into his life comes Cleve (Woods), a mysterious man who saves Meechum&apos;s life and announces that he is a paid assassin and wishes Meechum to write a book about his work for a top name in industry......\n\nOnly in America Dennis.\n\nIt&apos;s a lovely hook is this, a cop and a killer paired together, their relationship explored via an uneasy buddy buddy formula, where the fruits of their partnership will bring very differing rewards. Along with the crackerjack turns from Dennehy (lovable burn-out) and Woods (cold-blooded calm), it&apos;s the smart screenplay from Cohen that makes Best Seller worthy of a rental at least. How it is going to pan out always keeps one interested in the tale, while there&apos;s clearly some snarky observations on America&apos;s lust for capital gain. Violence flits in and out to add some bloody pulp to proceedings, but ultimately it&apos;s the dialogue, the suspicious mood crafted by Flynn and characterisations that give the film its vitality.\n\nReleased in the same year as Lethal Weapon, it appears that Best Seller got lost in the slip-stream of that higher octane fuelled picture (in fact Dennehy gets to say the same &quot;too old for this&quot; line that Glover trademarked in Lethal Weapon). It&apos;s not on a par with Donner&apos;s movie, and it&apos;s far from perfect; the ending is a bit tamer than we would perhaps like and Paul Shenar&apos;s villain is a standard suit job, but there&apos;s good craft here on the page and on both sides of the camera. 7/10",

It also moves the story of Gatlantis into a more believable arc. Thus far the whole 2199-2202 SBY series has been better than the 1970s original series. Enjoying this Space Opera very much.",

You&apos;ll love the way they throw in the 16th century misreading of YHWH (Yahweh) as &quot;Jehovah.&quot; Are you a Biblical literalist? Then enjoy the way the filmmakers have Moses abandon his wife and kiddies, let Aaron off the hook, and rewrite the punishment of the Israelites for that unfortunate Golden Calf affair. Are you a fan of Saturday morning cartoons? Stick with those; they have better acting and more wit.\n\nThe movie is also misnamed; the Big 10 occupy only a small part of it. It would have been better call it &quot;Moses.&quot; Actually, it would have been best to leave it alone.",

Their storyline is thus the most heart-warming of all.\n\nThe two soldiers from opposing forces provide much of the slapstick of movie, and they are very good, with exceptionally funny facial expressions.\n\nAnd let¡¯s not count Lena Farugia and Hans Strydom out, who play a doctor of law from New York and a zoologist on assignment ¨C their opposite-attract romance is rather stereotypical but Lena in particular is such a charming delight that I forget how much Strydom looks like Tom Selleck, instead, wonder why Lena had not since made another movie - yes, really sad :( - she could¡¯ve been a big star.\n\nSo in the end, one very funny little film, worth every penny and more to rent or buy. Keep some band-aids with you while watching, as you may get some stitches in your side."

      "reviewBody": "As a fan of Claire Denis&apos; Beau Travail in which there are extensive references to Le Petit Soldat, I&apos;ve been keen to see this film for a while. My expectations were high and after viewing it two days ago I feel like I haven&apos;t been let down.  I still can&apos;t believe that it&apos;s made over 40 years ago - it&apos;s that fresh, that immediate in its emotional poignancy.\n\n What grand topics Godard is trying to address: do we have ideals?  are they more significant than our personal pride? knowing we&apos;re powerless, should we just go with the flow?  Godard&apos;s answers are vague and uncertain, but the manner in which he answers them is vital.  His hero knows that he can&apos;t win, he doesn&apos;t even know which camp he&apos;s supposed to be in, but he resists. While he sees his world as quite meaningless, he allows himself to be seduced by beauty and dignity: classical music, Velasquez&apos; grey eyes, photography, Britanny&apos;s light, &quot;did I cry?&quot;...  In a world where no one can be trusted,  he chooses to be his own ally.  He finds his comrade in a woman of a different camp - you can read it as either his disillusion with ideology or his faith in love.\n\nThe connection between Le Petit Soldat and Beau Travail is so strong that Beau Travail feels like an offspring of Le Petit Soldat.  It goes beyond the more obvious references (I have a lot of time ahead of me; maybe freedom begins with remorse; the time for action is over).  Both are so true to their point of view that they border on solipsism;  both adore the beauty of flesh to the point of fetish (Subor has the most expressive biceps I&apos;ve ever seen in my life;  Gregoire Colin, whose presence bears a striking resemblance to the young Subor, is known as &quot;Gregoire the Magnificent&quot;); and both Godard and Denis are masters at capturing a spontaneity in which no thought can be hidden from the camera.  While Godard despairs over a world that is losing its ideals, Denis rediscovers meanings in a world that&apos;s supposedly meaningless to begin with.  For this reason, I&apos;d recommend watching the two films together at least once.\n\nThe beauty and the expressiveness of the film assured that its soul effects can&apos;t be achieved in any other media form.  The cinematography is invigorating, gritty, and elegant. It&apos;s a film that&apos;s at the same time dry and lush - dry because of its understated, calm tone(the torture scene!) and lush because of its rich undercurrents.  A crispy, translucent film.  Its marvels are designed to fade the moment they bloom (Subor and Karina&apos;s Spanish salute to each other).\n\nActing is superb.  Subor is a mixture of physical reserve and mental sensitivity.  His presence is so edgy and powerful that from time to time you forget he&apos;s really as good-looking as any dark and handsome man.  Anna Karina&apos;s performance is ethereal - her beauty must have inspired Godard to say &quot;woman should not age over 25.&quot;  Both are elusive and candid, which adds to the dreamlike quality of the film.\n\nIf you believe in personal and honest filmmaking, this one is for you. I&apos;ve seen a number of Godard&apos;s movies, but none had drawn me closer to Godard the filmmaker than Le Petit Soldat.  In other films he&apos;s observant, and in this one he&apos;s self-aware.  The story is heady, but he narrates in a calm tone, like he&apos;s in a negotiation with you.  Because of that, you hear every word he says."

I&apos;m sure a better cast could have been found by using rejects from film making school.\n\nThe editing is irritating - quarter second views at different angles of the same object, combined with the irritating audio. The voices are too quiet to hear without turning the volume up, but annoying electronic sounds like phones and alarm clocks ringing practically blow out your speakers.\n\nThe story does not make sense. One of the first scenes is completely bizarre. I watched this movie with friends who do not speak English. Despite the lack of dialogue in the beginning of the film we both could not figure out what was happening.\n\nI recommend not wasting your time with this film. I&apos;m surprised any company even backed this production financially and decided to publish it.\n\nThis movie is easily the worst I&apos;ve ever seen.",

      "reviewBody": "Fernando Pérez&apos;s &quot;Hello Hemingway&quot; looks at 1950s Havana through the eyes of impoverished high school girl Larita (Laura de la Uz), who hopes to study in the United States. Larita lives near Ernest Hemingway, while idolizing the likes of Paul Newman, Tony Curtis and Elvis Presley. Along with trying as hard as possible to get a scholarship to the US, Larita occasionally participates in protests against the Batista regime. At once a study of Cuba right before the revolution and also a look at an individual&apos;s hope of a better life, the film is certainly a fine addition to the pantheon of historical movies told through children&apos;s eyes, like Joe Dante&apos;s &quot;Matinee&quot;.\n\nI&apos;ve only seen a few Cuban movies, but I have liked them all. It&apos;ll be nice when Americans are finally allowed to travel to the Caribbean island. But beyond that, &quot;Hello Hemingway&quot; shows how much better movies are when they concentrate on plot and characters, as opposed to every blow-&apos;em-up flick released by Hollywood.\n\nIt seems like it would have been hard for a Cuban director to get permission to use The Diamonds&apos; &quot;Little Darlin&apos;&quot;.",

You&apos;d think with all the technology available and the decent story, the producers could have given us an adult film. Michael Pare&apos; is a limited actor at best. He has a face the camera loves but is really wooden in his expressions. The director did not push him, and if he did, he didn&apos;t push hard enough. If this film were made today, there are many quality people who could fill all the characters aptly. Although I personally like Nancy Allen&apos;s look, she could expand her acting as well. I know she can act, if only a director would get inside her head and bring out her ability.\n\nAs far as the story line goes, again, it could have been handled so much better, It has a cheap made-for-TV quality to it. I hope someone makes it over. Yes, a repeat performance of the Hollywood kind would be greatly appreciated."

Then, her darling son Scout (Liam Hughes), around 8 years old, suffered a serious illness which went on and on. Now, Scout is better but there are huge medical bills. Not quite finished with a nursing degree, Willa works the lesser paying home care positions. Lo and behold, her last patient, a gentleman estranged from his family long ago, leaves Willa $100,000 AND a vacation in Oregon&apos;s lovely Bramble House B &amp; B. Thankful beyond words, Willa and Scout start their journey from Minnesota. Meanwhile, Finn (David Haydn-Jones), the true son of Willa&apos;s last patient, gets word of his father&apos;s will. Aghast that his parent &quot;cheated&quot; his family in life and death, Finn goes to Oregon, also, to see if he can judge if Willa took deep advantage of his dad&apos;s last days. Yet, once there, Finn finds lovely Willa a beautiful human being, inside and out, from the first moment. Scout is likewise a darling. With his sister breathing over his neck about the injunction they are about to file over the will, can Finn really be hateful to Willa? Not when she steals his heart away piece by piece! This beautiful movie, a new one in the long, long, long list of Hallmark romance films, is sweet and meaningful. Its basic theme is forgiveness with a dash of courage. Reeser and Haydn-Jones are perfect and Hughes is a doll. In addition, the Oregon setting, complete with a handsome house and a darling village, is most welcoming. What can one say but add this to your list of gotta-watch-this-season flicks.",

      "reviewBody": "This film is directed and co-authored by Franco Zeffirelli, and I couldn&apos;t resist speculating on how much of it was actually true, since it is said to be based on Zeffirelli&apos;s autobiography. However, true in part, true completely, in the end it doesn&apos;t really matter. What matters is the amazing ensemble acting by Maggie Smith, Cher, Joan Plowwright, Judi Dench and Lily Tomlin (listing them in the order of significance to the story) and the stunning beauty of Florence where the film is set. The director and photographer plainly love the city, matching the love for it of the characters. Maggie Smith as the widow of a former British ambassador, the character that actually has tea with Mussolini, is the dominant figure in the film. However, Cher, playing a wealthy American -- vulgar in the eyes of he British ladies -- who turns out to be a complex, philanthropic Jew who must be smuggled out of the country in the end; Joan Plowwright as a kind lady who takes in the bastard son of an Italian businessman and teaches him to be an English gentleman; Judi Dench as an eccentric artist whose passion is to preserve a renaissance fresco from the Nazis during the war, and Lily Tomlin as a lesbian American archaeologist all deliver sterling performances. Cher&apos;s performance is the most amazing -- she holds her own in formidable company -- but one expects, of course, to be dazzled by Maggie Smith, Joan Plowwright, Judi Dench and even by Lily Tomlin. It&apos;s a sentimental, even melodramatic, tale, but see it for the ensemble acting. I can&apos;t think of another film that equals Tea with Mussolini in that respect.",

      "reviewBody": "This early sound-era portrayal of Sherlock Holmes is good for its era and genre, with solid acting and an interesting story that is set in a believably mysterious atmosphere. An important note is that the story has no real similarity with the Arthur Conan Doyle story titled &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, but rather draws its characters and material from several different stories, plus at least one Agatha Christie novel. As long as you don&apos;t expect to see the original story, there is certainly enough to make this a feature worth seeing.\n\nReginald Owen is solid as Holmes, although he does not leave his mark on the role in the way that Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett did. Owen does have the unique distinction of having played both Holmes and Dr. Watson (having played the latter in &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; the year before &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;).\n\nThe rest of the cast likewise play their characters in a straightforward fashion, allowing the story and atmosphere to get the main focus. The one who does stand out is Anna May Wong, who adds beauty and a mysterious presence, although unfortunately she does not get a lot of screen time.\n\nThe story itself has numerous turns, and keeps you guessing. The atmosphere might not always be Holmes-like, but it is quite suitable for the story, and it is aided by good use of the lighting and photography. Overall, if you can set aside the misleading (for Holmes fans) title, it is an entertaining mystery with some good touches."

Machiko is grieving the (apparently recent, though it&apos;s unclear) death of her young son, while Shigeki still mourns the loss of his wife, 33 years earlier. Their relationship to each other and to their grief during an excursion when they get lost in the woods. Their bond is complicated by Shigeki&apos;s dementia, whose often childlike behavior surely resonates with Machiko. It&apos;s an interesting, contemplative and spiritual exploration of grief with some lovely moments. Without spoiling anything, a charming early scene of Shigeki at the piano takes on a heartbreaking twist. Later, as Machiko desperately tries to control his reckless quest through the forest, we get hints of how she lost her child and the unresolved feelings she has.\n\nAlthough there are gorgeous scenes (the two playing amidst rows of geometrically carved hedges, for example) the hand-held cinematography isn&apos;t doing the film any favors. It may have been more appropriate in the latter half, as their journey takes them deeper into the wild. But the shaky camera-work throughout the entire movie adds nothing. Maybe it just comes naturally to Naomi Kawase, whose work is primarily in documentaries (although she&apos;s no stranger to drama).\n\nI don&apos;t know if this is an accurate representation of a Japanese senior facility, or an idealized one. I know that respect for elders is more ingrained in their culture. The home certainly appears to be a great deal more comfortable, dignified and serene than what we have. Perhaps it&apos;s a very expensive one, though we get no hints that Shigeki is particularly wealthy.\n\nI thought it could have explored its themes a bit deeper, and there are the aforementioned camera issues, but overall I liked the film a great deal. It ends on a strikingly beautiful note. I&apos;d like to see more by Kawase.",

      "description": "Grief seeks relief in beautifully mounted, but thoughtful mood piece from Japan&apos;s Naomi Kawase...\n\nTen years after becoming the youngest winner of the Camera d&apos;Or, Naomi Kawase returned to Cannes and claimed the prestigious Grand Prix for THE MOURNING FOREST[Mogari no mori], a beautiful and contemplative portrait of grief.\n\nMachiko (Machiko Ono) is a young nurse who still carries the burden of her young son&apos;s death. Shigeki (Shigeki Uda) is an elderly widower and a resident at the nursing home where Machiko works. After celebrating Shigeki&apos;s birthday, Machiko takes him for a drive in the countryside, but their car breaks down and Shigeki absconds into the nearby forest. Machiko has no choice but to follow, and they become lost in the dense woodlands, before their fates eventually become entwined.\n\nDrawing comparisons to Shohei Imamura (particularly his Palme d&apos;Or winning The Ballad of Narayama) and Terence Malick, Naomi Kawase&apos;s THE MOURNING FOREST is a hauntingly beautiful, symbolically rich masterpiece, and The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present the film for the first time ever on Blu-ray, in a special Dual Format edition.\n\nAvailable to order from:  Amazon http://amzn.to/2t67tQG",

      "reviewBody": "The term &quot;torture porn&quot; came into vogue some years ago, referring to movies deemed to have no value, purpose, or anything to offer, other than shocking violence / gore. It&apos;s a bit humorous that many people act as if this were some new phenomenon.\n\nBLOODSUCKING FREAKS stands as part of a tradition started by the likes of Herschell Gordon Lewis in the early 1960&apos;s. Basically, these are true, updated Grand Guignol theater presentations on film. Grand Guignol didn&apos;t rely heavily on plot, but on pure shock. This movie does what it sets out to do. It&apos;s violent, vile, and visceral, much like LAST HOUSE ON DEAD END STREET, though with decidedly less structure or story line. It does have a wicked sense of humor to -somewhat- offset the senseless, grisly acts.\n\nIf you are averse to cannibalism, dismemberment, decapitation, degrading female nudity, etc., you might find this quite disturbing. However, if the thought of a mad doctor drinking someone&apos;s brains through a straw intrigues you, then this is your movie! Is it art? Is it pointless rubbish? Is it dangerous? Well, perhaps it&apos;s none or all of these things. One thing is certain, it&apos;s not easily forgotten..."

Even more surprisingly as the handcraft is good.\n\nReasons for this is partly Shin Eun-Kyung, who is dull and uninspired as an actress, partly the editing in the thriller segments which could have been tighter.\n\nShin Hyeon-Jun on the other hand does a good job, together with the rest of the cast.",

      "reviewBody": "This film tells the story of an unfaithful wife who seeks relationships with &apos;famous&apos; artists, while ignoring her unglamorous doctor husband, who endures her infidelity with stoicism. Based on a novella by Chekhov, it is allegedly based on a real-life love triangle between some of Chekhov&apos;s friends. At the time of publication, it caused a minor scandal and caused a rift between Chekhov and his friends, but given the film was made more than 50 years later, the &apos;scandal&apos; element was probably lost on audience (it certainly is for contemporary viewers).\n\nThis is very very much a &apos;studio&apos; production (made at Mosfilm), and if it had been made in Hollywood (or even France) with a well known cast, it might have been an enduring minor classic. But, Soviet films, especially from this era, tend to be forgotten/overlooked, perhaps as people assume they&apos;ll have strong political messages. Often that&apos;s true, but not really with this one. Anyone who enjoys an old fashioned style melodrama, handsomely produced and well acted (for the era), will probably enjoy this. Nothing spectacular, but a solid outing.",

      "reviewBody": "Yes this is another one of those laughers where a 30something (Smith) tries to play a 20 year old college boy lothario. That is a time tested Hollywood tradition, and not unexpected in a movie of this caliber. What really tests any semblance of credibility is the &apos;college&apos; itself. Trust me, there isn&apos;t a real college anywhere this side of an internet diploma mill that looks like this one. What you really have depicted here is one of those $2500.00 three day weekend seminars where art history majors and trust fund freelance photographers go to get a couple hours instruction in Photoshop tweaks on how to produce fine art prints with inkjets, or something along that line. Lots of time at the pool, plenty of time for sex games among the precocious Botox and Power Peel set, and one or two hangover busting workshops looking at digital slides.\n\nThe only sex scene really worth anything is when the Evil Nerd does a quick and nasty &apos;back seat&apos; style hump on a cute blonde one night on the grass in the resort courtyard. A little bare tit shows up, and the blonde&apos;s orgasmic cries are slightly above porno grade. \n\nThe real standout, though, is the cinematography. Through careful photographic site selection, grimy and tawdry modern LA is distorted into a rather appealing collection of exotic faux Mediterranean and colonial California Mission locales where the vistas are always bathed in warm late afternoon sunglow or hidden among cool, seductive night shadows. This city hasn&apos;t looked this good since Jack and Faye explored it in &apos;Chinatown.&apos; Or at least since the soap opera, &apos;Santa Barbara.&apos;\n\nRent this only if you want to see LA presented the way the California Department of Tourism might want you to see it."

However, their next one is going to be tough, as Juliet (Barbara Feldon) was just hired by the mistress and this newcomer doesn&apos;t realize the staff are a bunch of thieves...so much of the film consists of the gang trying to keep her busy and away from their planning. However, when she does discover their plans, she isn&apos;t against this! So what&apos;s next? See the caper film yourself and see.\n\nThis is a very amiable caper picture. While it&apos;s not a classic like &quot;Rififi&quot;, director Delbert Mann and the cast do a nice job. Additionally, the ending offers a nice surprise and the film is worth your time.\n\nBy the way, if you do see this, look for a very young Sam Waterston in a small role as one of the thieves.",

Gupt starred Bobby Deol, Manisha Koirala and Kajol in the main roles.\n\nI have watched this movie many times and its varied theme made me interested in it. The movie is not a typical Bollywood crap.\n\nA plot with lots of twist and turns. The movie is about Bobby Deol who is convicted to life imprisonment for murdering his step father.Deol has all the evidence against him in the murder case to kill his father.His love interest is played by old flame Kajol as well as Manisha Koraila who his step father wanted him to get married to.Deol escapes from jail with the help of Manisha and vows to get to the bottom of the matter as to who killed his step father and why He also has the uneviable task of running from the law as a convict who has run from jail.Other co-actors like ompuri, raza murad, prem chopra and others have also performed to their best.i will not tell more as it will reveal suspense for those who have not watched it yet.\n\nDirection by Rajiv Rai is excellent. As the writer, he has done extremely well to keep audience guessing till the end.He also keeps the pace of the film tight and fluid as the editor. The cinematography is eye-catching and Gupt features some of the best locales ever filmed.\n\nThe music was a very important factor in making the movie a hit. I think that the music of the movie is among my all-time favorites.Music director viju shah has done an excellent job.Movie&apos;s Background score is classic.\n\n&apos;&apos;Mere Sanam&apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;Yeh Pyassi Javani&apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;Gupt Gupt&apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;Yeh Pyar Kya Hai&apos;&apos;, Mere Khabon Mein&apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;Becheniyam&apos;&apos;, &apos;&apos;Duniya Haseenom Ka Mela&apos;&apos; - all are great to hear with some quick as well as different beats. This is one of those less movies which has each and every song perfect and loving to hear.The film&apos;s soundtrack is one of the best of the year 1997.\n\nThis movie is definitely a must see and I highly recommended to everyone.see it to Believe it.10/10",

All the material was borrowed from other Alien movies. It was as if someone watched the entire Alien series and noted all the good and memorable parts, and then made a movie. The CGI of a certain character was also horrible, and looked as if someone did on their phone. The iconic Ripley line from one character was cringeworthy. I liked &quot;Prey&quot; and I admire the story for the fact that they did something original. I liked Fede&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t Breathe&quot; and went to see it without any prior knowledge about the movie. I wish they had done something original with Romulus, and I feel very disappointed with the lack of originality of the movie. I&apos;ll give it 6/10."

This takes Dawson deep into the heart of dance clubs, where he dances like he&apos;s got spiders in his shirt.\n\nDawson also treks through the jungles of Africa, encountering things called &quot;wild animals&quot;, as well as a woman known as the &quot;Sacred Monkey&quot; (Esmeralda Barros). Having lost her top, she runs free through the trees, her long, magic hair somehow covering her assets, no matter how she moves, or what she does!\n\nFor his part, Muller is building an army of remote-controlled go-rillas! He&apos;s definitely crackers, with only world conquest in mind.\n\nLoaded to the gills with imbecilic characters and absurd dialogue, this is one of the few movies that can actually turn a brain to stone. So, be careful! Calling this movie &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;inane&quot;, is like calling a 5-lb. Cheeseburger with a shovel-full of fries... &quot;fattening&quot;. It also has an extremely high boredom factor that only the hardiest of souls could possibly endure. As with all such hyper-sludge, it&apos;s best to simply go with it, for going against it could cause cranial collapse..."

      "name": "Zootopia : The Inspiring Movie",
      "reviewBody": "Zootopia is a 3D animation movie produced by Walt Disney. Zootopia is a big city over there. Like its name, this city contains all animal characters such a zoo as well. We can find so many animal characters here and of course they bring their own characteristics. They are rabbits, foxes, goats, sheeps, wolfs, lion, sheep, rhinoceros, and any others. And the main character is a bunny or we know it as a rabbit called Judy Hopps. Ya, just a little rabbit who has wanted to be a policewoman since she was child while there was no rabbit be police. There is no matter if the citizen are just rabbits, but the problem is the citizen are not only rabbits but all of animals are over there. There are many big and strong animals such rhinoceros or lions who are more appropriate to be police than just a bunny. She had been underestimated by every one for dreaming to be police, even by her parents. But it was not a problem for her, even she must pass many difficulties, she just kept trying and trying and finally she got appreciation to be the best police since she could finish a mission of a case and found something new on it.\n\n1. Animation The animation moving is very smooth such as another 3D animation movie. The characters are drawn well, suit to their characteristic. We can know directly how is a character&apos;s feature even just see them, not watch them. It run a same way when some characters turn characteristic, from good to bad or vice versa, we can know it directly by their expression. It eases children to know how feature of the characters are, so they won&apos;t be confused by watching this movie especially when some characters change their appanage. This movie has a beautiful color, contras but still in harmony and it makes gazer, from children to adult, be able to enjoy this movie well. 2. Score For me, every single sound in this movie is nice, very nice. From the dubbing, sound effect, and of course the sound track. The sound track, Try Everything by Shakira, is very representative that movie and it suits when it played while Judy Hopps was enjoying her journey from her hometown to Zootopia. So, we, as gazer, can enjoy both of picture and the song. 3. Plot twist This is the most unexpected part of this movie when Mrs. Bellwether changed into a bad character. In the beginning, she was very good and helpful to Judy, but it turned out that she was a mastermind of all of &quot;disaster&quot; in the movie. This part gives us some breaks when we have a bit been bored think who is the mastermind of the problem. 4. Moral Value Same as its soundtrack, this movie reminds us not to give up on everything, just keep trying and trying, trying everything and making something new. Life is all about problems, problems always come and leave. One problem has been solved and another problem will come to us, of course, that&apos;s a life. And for facing our problem, just ignore people say for braking our dream, just keep trying and prove that we can do for reaching our dream. And don&apos;t be afraid to fall on our journey, believe in ourselves that we can, we can, and we can. This movie was very impressive to me when I watched in 2016, I was in senior high school. I had a dream that it was very difficult for me at that time. It made me doubt that I could reach my dream. By watching this movie, I cried and created an advice for my own, &quot;Believe in yourself that you can reach what you want as long as you want to try more, more and more, nothing impossible in this world.&quot; Moreover, the plot twist reminds us for not to ease believing someone and not to judge a book by its cover.\n\nFor me, this movie has almost no lack. This film is very recommended for watching by everyone, from children to adult, even elderly, because of its own picture and its value. For children who haven&apos;t been able to understand the value, they can enjoy the beautiful picture, the cute characters and moments, and of course the song. And for another, they can remind themselves by value of this movi",

This can be placed in the baseball genre as well as a coming of age drama. Most movies claim to be one or the other and sometimes fail to be. Then again, when a good movie hits a homerun it can not only become a money maker and a box office smash, it can also become timeless. Before they became giants of Hollywood, Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins stars in this great movie as some of the most interesting, yet simple characters. Costner plays an aging baseball player who meets with rookie, soon to be great major league pitcher Tim Robbins. Out of the rafters comes Susan Surandon who, in her own may, is a Muse of the religion of baseball. Together, the three introduce three different worlds upon the audience. Each are believable characters even though they are in a way, fantasy like. A great story with a perfect ending, Bull Durham is one of those hard to find movies that is a crowd pleaser with just about every audience out there.",

It is John Waters&apos; best mainstream film, and its tongue-in-cheek portrayal of suburbia, domesticity, the media, and conventional gender roles is delightfully subversive. Kathleen Turner was criminally underrated--this was her best performance to date. The dialogue is hilarious, the murders are wickedly funny, and the overall atmosphere of the film is disturbingly bright and shiny. Co-stars Waters regulars Mink Stole, Ricki Lake, Traci Lords, and features a dynamite cameo by grunge goddesses L7. My Rating: 9/10",

The story is taken from a German fairy-tale by Wilhelm Hauff. Like many German fairy-tales the setting is the Black Forest, which is nevertheless an interesting fact, keeping in mind that it was cold-war times and the Black Forest part of West-Germany. Apart from being a piece of very subtle socialist propaganda, it is an impressive work of art. The movie plays with German archetypes in a masterly way, the character of the Hollaender Michel is one thing that stays in mind, the state-of-the-art special effects are another one. East-German movie production came never again anywhere close to it. It is a very interesting experience to watch that movie again some 20 years later and notice the dream-like narration in complete accord with the allusions to class-struggle and the last breaths of a unified German conscience at that time. Very nice, and never really appreciated for its accomplishments... I give it 9 of 10, the last frame is too obvious...",

      "reviewBody": "Intimacy (2001) was co-written and directed by Patrice Chéreau. The movie stars Mark Rylance as Jay, the head barman at a club. Somehow, he has met Claire, played by Kerry Fox. To Jay&apos;s surprise, Claire reappears every Wednesday at his apartment to have sex with him. (That&apos;s the only way to phrase it. They don&apos;t talk, and there&apos;s no foreplay. They just tear their clothes off and go at it.) There&apos;s plenty of nude scenes of both Fox and Rylance. However, it&apos;s not really erotic, because the apartment is so dirty and unkempt that all I could think of was &quot;it&apos;s disgusting.&quot;\n\nMatters would have apparently continued along in this way, except that Jay wants to know more about Claire. He manages to track her down to a pub/theater, where she&apos;s starring in &quot;The Glass Menagerie.&quot; This brings him into contact with Andy, Claire&apos;s husband, played brilliantly by Timothy Spall. \n\nThe plot really begins at this point, and I will carefully avoid explaining what happens next. I won&apos;t avoid saying that the plot appeared contrived and, basically, ridiculous. I wasn&apos;t familiar with the work of Kerry Fox, but she&apos;s an excellent actor. Rylance and Spall are great actors. It&apos;s hard to understand just what went wrong with this film. Some reviewers have suggested that director could have made a better movie in France than in England. Maybe we in the English-speaking world think that this bizarre plots works better if the actors are smoking Gauloises and drinking wine, rather than smoking Mayfairs and drinking ale.\n\nIf you really want to see this movie, you&apos;ll have to decide whether you want to see all the sex (unrated version) or just the suggestion of sex (R-rated version). The movie has no real outdoor scenes, so it will work as well on DVD (which is how we saw it) as it will on the large screen. This isn&apos;t a great movie for anyone. If you want porn, buy porn. If you want narrative drama, buy narrative drama. Intimacy promises both, and gives you neither.",

      "reviewBody": "In his diary entry for June 2, 1941, German Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels recorded his opinion of &quot;Stukas&quot; after attending a preview:\n\n&quot;New Ritter film, &apos;Stukas.&apos;  Quite good, with some wonderful air footage, but a typical Ritter production.  He cannot lead people.  Rather too noisy.&quot;\n\nThe American perspective was decidedly more negative.  The broadcast journalist Howard K. Smith offered this scathing description in &quot;Last Train From Berlin:&quot;\n\n&quot;It was a monotonous film about a bunch of obstreperous adolescents who dived bombed things and people.  The bombed anything and anybody.  That&apos;s all the film was - just one bombing after another.  Finally the hero got bored with bombing and lost interest in life - so they took him off to the Bayreuth music festival where he listened to a few lines of  Wagner&apos;s music; his soul began to breathe again, he got visions of the Fuhrer and of guns blazing away, so he impolitely left right in the middle of the first act and dashed back and started bombing things again with the old gusto.&quot;\n\nSmith was understandably horrified, but 60 years later the real horror is not in the films depiction of bombing, but in its death-worshiping dialogue.\n\n&quot;Stukas&quot; is the story of a dive bomber squadron during the Battle of France in May-June 1940.  The primary characters are the commander, played by Carl Raddatz, who here and in &quot;Wunschkonzert&quot; is the epitome of a Luftwaffe officer, and the flight surgeon, played by O.E. Hasse, best known as the confessed killer in Hitchcock&apos;s &quot;I Confess.&quot;   The pilot Smith described as &quot;bored&quot; is played by Hannes Stelzer, who ironically was killed later in the war.\n\nAlthough the action focuses on dive bombing, the real theme of the film is the willingness, indeed the necessity, to risk death in the service of Germany.  In the moral universe of &quot;Stukas&quot;, there is no finer death in the world.  Hauptmann Bork (Raddatz) salutes the fallen:  &quot;Yes, one does not think about their death, but instead about what they have died for, and remembers them like the young gods that they are.&quot;  Deeply moved, Doctor Gregorius (Hasse) recites lines from a poem titled &quot;&quot;Death for the Fatherland.&quot;  The verse reads in part:\n\n&quot;O take me, let me join that circle, so that I will not die a common death! I do not want to die in vain; but I would love to perish on a hill of sacrifice&quot;\n\n&quot;for the Fatherland, to bleed the blood of my heart, for the Fatherland - and soon it is done!  To you, dear ones!  I come , to join those who taught me to live and to die!&quot;\n\nThis ode to death must rank as one of the most chilling speeches in any film, especially given the nature of the cause that it honors.\n\nFor further insights into &quot;Stukas&quot; and other films of the period, I highly recommend Jay W. Baird&apos;s &quot;To Die for Germany&quot; from which the above quotations were drawn.  This is perhaps the best book ever written on Nazi aesthetics and their integral cult of death."

What a beauty of a woman this Laura Antonelli is, I consider her the most beautiful woman in the world, more beautiful than all the beautiful actresses, like other Italians I have been in love with more or less, Virna Lisi, Monica Vitti, Sylva Koscina, Silvana Mangano, Anonella Lualdi, Rossana Podestà, Sophia Loren, Monica Bellucci, Claudia Cardinale, Gina Lollobrigida, Ornella Muti, Stefania Sandrelli. The film is worth seeing just for her. A little for Michele Placido and Jean Rochefort too. Alberto Lionello&apos;s acting is too exaggerated. The talented director Luigi Comencini also delighted me with other films such as: &quot;The Scopone Game Original title: Lo scopone scientifico (1972) and &quot;Misunderstood&quot; Original title: Incompreso (Vita col figlio) (1966). The 10 stars are less for the film than for Laura Antonaz, known as Antonelli.",

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s always fun making it to the first screening of a new film on the very day it opens. My film-crazy friends and I habitually did this in our college days. Long years later, the thrill has not worn off. This time, the film I lined up to watch at its first screening in town is &quot;Eklavya  The Royal Bodyguard&quot;. Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the filmmaker who, in the capacity of either director or producer, gave us &quot;Parinda&quot;, &quot;Mission Kashmir&quot;, &quot;Parineeta&quot;, and the two wonderful Munna Bhai movies, was unveiling his new directorial effort, and I was eager to see what lay in store.\n\n&quot;Eklavya&quot; boasts a huge cast of eminent actors; how their services would be utilized has piqued my curiosity for some time. The glittering line-up features Amitabh Bachchan in the title role, along with Chopra regulars Saif Ali Khan, Sunjay Dutt, the exquisite Vidya Balan, Boman Irani, Parikshat Sahni, Jackie Shroff, Jimmy Sher Gill, Raima Sen, and an elegant cameo by Sharmila Tagore.\n\nThe film opens with the unmistakable voice of Amitabh Bachchan narrating the legend of Eklavya from the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata. Eklavya, a child of undistinguished antecedents yearns to study archery under the tutelage of Dronacharya, the instructor of kings. Contemptuous of his low birth, Dronacharya refuses to accept Eklavya as a student. Undeterred, Eklavya builds a clay effigy of Dronacharya and ceaselessly practices archery before it. Soon after, Dronacharya is taken aback by Eklavya&apos;s proficiency, which has outstripped that of his princely pupils. As it wouldn&apos;t do for this commoner&apos;s skills to rival those of the royalty, the crafty Dronacharya demands a &quot;dakshina&quot; or teacher&apos;s fee from Eklavya. Whatever you wish, the devoted lad replies. Your right thumb--that is what I want as my &quot;dakshina&quot;, commands Dronacharya. Without hesitation, Eklavya slices off the thumb, knowing full well it would end his prowess in archery. The story is meant to illustrate the notion of &quot;dharma&quot; or the fulfillment of one&apos;s sacred duty in any circumstance, regardless of cost. Off screen, the child to whom Amitabh recounts the story protests this outcome, and his shrill tones are the voice of reason.\n\nAmitabh, like his dutiful namesake Eklavya, is the loyal manservant and bodyguard of a line of minor royalty in Rajasthan. Despite the family&apos;s tyrannical ways, he unswervingly stands by them. The film unfolds in the present, but this particular royal family still resides in a fog of past glory, entitlement, and unquestioned power. Their continuing nastiness has made the natives restless, and the worm is about to turn.\n\nThe Queen Mother&apos;s (Sharmila Tagore) deathbed revelation sets the somewhat baroque, overwrought plot in motion. The heir apparent (Saif Ali Khan), who had earlier fled the principality in disgust at the profligate ways of his relatives, is summoned home for her funeral. Before breathing her last, the Queen pens a letter to her son spilling the proverbial beans. This confession causes a domino effect of cross and double cross, intrigue and counter-intrigue.\n\nThe film has the look and feel of a stately epic, but Vidhu Vinod Chopra is not interested in the luxuriant pace associated with epics. There is a business-like economy in his approach. There is no waxing philosophical about the misdeeds that have brought this family to its present ugly impasse. He appears to say that was then, in the past, there&apos;s no time for that; let&apos;s simply watch how their karmic debts are collected now. Voice-overs and numerous brisk flashbacks provide just enough expository detail to follow the events unfolding in the present. The pace is breathless, as though generations of past injustices can wait no longer for expiation. Every now and then, there is a moment of stillness, which one wishes would be held a few seconds longer for the mood to be savored. An effective scene on the palace ramparts is reminiscent of the ghostly visitation in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and the wraith, despite no lines to declaim, has similar impact.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan&apos;s magisterial performance as a man programmed for blind duty, having to suddenly distinguish between obligation and reason transcends the silliness of the plot. Saif Ali Khan impresses yet again; there is maturity and depth in his performance as the conflicted prince with the populist conscience. Unlike &quot;Parineeta&quot;, Vidya Balan doesn&apos;t have a whole lot to do here, but is dignified and graceful in her few scenes as the commoner in love with a prince. Boman Irani, an actor of sweeping range and intelligence, is a hoot with his hissy fits and sloe-eyed ambiguity, while Jackie Shroff and Jimmy Sher Gill, as the wicked uncle and cousin, handle the villainy with lip-smacking gusto. Sunjay Dutt, fresh off his Munnabhai success, is a welcome presence as the investigating police officer with little patience for the anachronisms of fiefdoms and effete royalty. What a pleasure it is to see Sharmila Tagore, who retains her looks and glamor despite the passage of the years.\n\n&quot;Eklavya&quot; displays a most un-Indian efficiency (in film-making terms, at least) and speed (a mere 105 minutes) in telling its tale that had me longing for a little more of some of the characters. It would be interesting to see just how much of the film was left on the editing room floorperhaps the DVD will have the deleted scenes. Music is used appropriately: there is a lone song, of which only a judicious snatch is used on screen. The cinematography makes full use of the gorgeous Rajasthani terrain, with its pitiless crags and sun-scorched sands. Clearly, Vidhu Vinod Chopra has an eye on international audiences for his film, and glowing endorsements from the likes of Ralph Fiennes enhance his chances. Here&apos;s to you, Mr. Chopra, and more power to you.",

      "reviewBody": "Below average SW about a merciless sheriff called Joe Williams , Peter Martell, who takes law on his own hands , carrying out an implacable justice as judge , jury and executioner . He is accused for murder and later on , wanted , alive or dead , poster reward : 7000 dollars. Along the way he is pursued by a deputy , Glenn Saxson. When a gang led by Pedro and his hoodlums , as Daniel Giordano and Franco Fantasía assault a bank , then Joe takes the robbed cash and they go after him . Joe Williams takes on the nasty Mexican bandit Pedro , Manuel Serrano , and henchman , Franco Fantasía. \n\n\n\n So-so Pasta Western packs noisy action , fights , thrills, go riding , crossfire and lots of violence . Customary Italian Western with usual actors as Peter Martell and Glenn Saxson and familiar secondaries as the brothers: Franco Fantasía and Andrea Fantasia as a corrupt judge and two gorgeous girls , Daniela Giordano and luisa Baratto . It stars the regular Spaghetti star Peter Martell or Pietro Martellanza . He performed several Westerns as Fury of Johnny kid , Arizona Colt , Two crosses in Danger Pass, Lola Colt ,Two men one death, Forgotten Pistolero , Unholy Four . Although he made other genres as Giallo or Terror as Omicidio Per Appuntamento, Death walks at midnight ,Killer Baby against Dracula , Tears of Kali.\n\n Lousy and faded cinematography by Aldo Greci , being necessary a perfect remastering because of the film copy is washed-out. Including inappropriate outdoors from El Lazio, Rome and Dino De Laurentiis studios . Pretty good musical score by Michele Lacerenza and conducted by Roberto Pregadio in Ennio Morricone style. The motion picture picture was badly directed by Alberto Cardone or Albert Cardiff. He was a prestigious second unit director or asistant director in known films as Barbarella , Plein Soleil, Don Camillo, Return of Don Camilo , Summer time, Carmen , Cagliostro and even Ben Hur. And he made some films mostly Westerns as Blood at sun down , Seven dollars in Red , Black Eagles of Santa Fe, Wrath of God , Massacre at Maribel city Twenty thousands dollars for seven. Rating: 4/10. An inferior Spaghetti , only for hardcore aficionados",

I would definitely recommend this short documentary to anyone out there who wants to be inspired. I really hope these people continue to make more films. I am definitely a fan. I am giving Life with Lupus a 10 out of 10 simply because this film is beyond what I was expecting for a student film. Also, I came across this film on YoungCuts in the Heat Wave section so I Google&apos;d it. It brought me to the IMDb page. I didn&apos;t notice any reviews so here is the first one.",

Anyone that has followed Jon&apos;s stellar film career knows that Liebling adds an immense amount of creativity and uniqueness to every project he is a part of. Liebling was only 21 at the time he worked on this picture, but his enormous talent - talent that transcends his young age - resonates throughout the film. Anyone who enjoyed Jon Liebling&apos;s stunning work in and on films such as, &quot;Endangered Species&quot; (who could forget his riveting, yet understated performance as &quot;the steward) should run to rent - if not BUY - this DVD if for no other reason than to bask in the glow that emanates from the screen as his credit rolls. As fans worldwide can attest, Jon Liebling is an unrivaled force in cinema - though he left the industry years ago, choosing instead to live the quiet life in idyllic Southern Vermont. Even still, his work - as well as his formidable contributions to the industry - will be celebrated (and, imitated) for years to come.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve never touched a surfboard in my life. But I did grow up swimming competitively and am a certified scuba diver, so I have a understanding of and respect for the ocean&apos;s power and allure. That&apos;s how a Kansas guy ended up seeing the surfing documentary &quot;Riding Giants&quot; in the middle of November. (Why exactly a Kansas theater was one of the five screens it was on this week is an entirely different question that I can&apos;t answer.)\n\nThe title &quot;Riding Giants&quot; has a two-pronged meaning, referring to both the act of harnessing huge waves and the larger than life people who are obsessed with doing just that. Featuring mood-setting music ranging from ukuleles to modern California rock, this 105-minute documentary serves as a history of the sport, shaming tripe like &quot;Gidget&quot; and even making &quot;Endless Summer&quot; look like something straight out of the kiddie pool.\n\n&quot;Riding Giants&quot; opens with a brief, animated, two-minute look at the first 1000 years of surfing, which ends about 1950, when the first big-name surfers began to work their magic. Using remarkable half-century old footage, the doc then follows their path to Hawaii, where surfing became not just a hobby, but a culture that was far more than the onslaught of bad surfing movies in the &apos;50s and &apos;60s led many to believe. The big wave surfers gradually progressed to bigger and better waves around the Hawaiian coast, where most of the surfing community was concentrated until the discovery of The Mavericks, a dangerous but glorious surfing mecca in Northern California. Eventually that locale triggered surfing&apos;s stateside explosion in popularity. But one man from Hawaii, Laird Hamilton, has sent the sport as mainstream as possible in recent years. Using teams and jet skis, Hamilton&apos;s vision and drive radically changed the mindset of what was possible as surfing entered the 21st century. \n\nThat is the documentary in a nutshell, and although it may not seem all that interesting, the suitable laid-back intensity of &quot;Riding Giants&quot; will engross anyone who has much interest in any aspect of surfing, whether it be the water, the culture, or the sport. Writer/director/narrator Stacey Peralta (&quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot;) knows something about counterculture himself, having been among the first professional skateboarders, so he does not tell the story in the condescending tones sometimes used in describing surfing. He instead treats his subjects much like NFL Films treats the National Football League. The athlete are borderline deities, and the tone is frequently reverential. He is aided in this tone by the interviewees, who run the gamut of surfing history from the original Hawaiian crew to the Northern California ground breakers to the current crop of competitive surfers. Virtually every relevant person mentioned is interviewed, which lends credence, particularly since many viewers will have little idea who most of the people are beforehand. \n\nSet up like a traditional documentary, Peralta&apos;s film lets the surfers themselves tell most of the stories, and he narrates when necessary to provide pertinent details. But the personalities and passion of the interviewees are what drive the picture. These guys are wired differently than most of us; there&apos;s no question about that. Their slightly irreverent but still respectful tone lets them get away with comparing the discovery of Hawaii&apos;s North Shore to Columbus stumbling upon America. An exaggeration? Of course, but the genuine emotion in their voices and faces make the words fully believable, much like a football player comparing his sport to a war.\n\nPerfectly complementing the almost mythic personalities are the ridiculously massive and powerful waves themselves. From the surprisingly good old-school 8mm footage shot from the shore to the digital in-your-face shots from a jet ski, the photography in Riding Giants is nothing short of stunning. The waves are simply huge, and even though you may have seen quality shots in &quot;Blue Crush&quot;, you haven&apos;t seen them on this grand and wild a scale. I guarantee your jaw will drop multiple times. \n\nThe fact that the history of the sport can be encapsulated in less than two hours gives the film a complete and satisfying feel, as opposed to something like Baseball, for which even ten hours was not enough. Those who don&apos;t have an interest in any aspect of surfing won&apos;t care for it, but even if you can&apos;t relate to the surfing directly, you will walk out of &quot;Riding Giants&quot; with a greater appreciation for the sport and a better understanding of what drives those who do it. \n\nBottom Line: &quot;Riding Giants&quot; effectively and absorbingly encapsulates surfing culture and history. 8 of 10.",

Von Cziffra directed without imagination and spirit and he is hopelessly inadequate in using the Ultrascope format. The result is a dull film, not helped much by an average cast; Conny Froboess seems not at all to be comfortable with her part and Ruth Stephan and Rudolf Platte, both always good for comic interludes, are very disappointing; it is only Maria Sebaldt who sometimes brings some life into the film.\n\nThe Kessler Twins have a guest appearance (always fun, those legs!!), but no one (and certainly not Von Cziffra) seems to wonder about the ladies&apos; dance act with 1960&apos;s music in an operetta that takes place round 1900.",

      "reviewBody": "No one has ever gotten the Mark Twain satire down quite right in any of the versions of A Connecticut Yankee that have been filmed including the best known versions, this one and the one done in 1949 starring Bing Crosby. But along the way we&apos;ve gotten some fine entertainment out of the notion of time travel, very unique at the time that Twain wrote the novel.\n\nWith both Will and Bing a built in audience was guaranteed for their respective versions, A Connecticut Yankee being privileged to have two of America&apos;s most beloved entertainers taking the role. Each invested their personalities in the part which made both films the success they respectively were.\n\nThis version is slightly updated from the novel which takes place at the cusp of the new 20th century. It starts during the present, the present of 1931 in the midst of the Great Depression. Will Rogers is not a blacksmith, he&apos;s a radio repairman who is called out on a dark and stormy night to fix a radio in the mansion where some strange characters inhabit. An accident knocks him out and he&apos;s taken back some 1400 years to the court of King Arthur at Camelot.\n\nDuring the course of the film Rogers brings about far more of the &quot;blessings&quot; of technology to Camelot than Crosby did in his film. The absurd climax with the Knights of the Round Table storming Morgan Le Fay&apos;s castle with all kinds of 20th century weaponry is the ultimate proof of that. \n\nIn the novel Twain had the Yankee&apos;s character be his mouthpiece for his views. In that sense Rogers as the voice of the modern era was uniquely suited to the part even though his accent was far more Oklahoma than Connecticut. In a gentler way Rogers made a lot of the same points in real life that he does in this film, in his newspaper columns and on his lecture tours. \n\nTwo women who later went to MGM around the same time co-star with Will Rogers in A Connecticut Yankee. Maureen O&apos;Sullivan who was a year away from her breakout role as Jane in Tarzan the Ape Man plays Lady Melisande, the daughter of William Farnum as King Arthur. Young Frank Albertson who Rogers takes under his wing as a protégé is in love with her and the Connecticut Yankee plays cupid. And before she became the perfect American wife Myrna Loy was playing all kinds of villainous roles as she is here as Morgan LeFay. Ironically in The Thin Man where Loy forever changed Loy&apos;s image Maureen O&apos;Sullivan also had a prominent role in that classic film.\n\nThe most recent version of this often filmed tale is Bad Knight with Martin Lawrence, not a bad version either. However I don&apos;t think Martin Lawrence would even say he&apos;s quite up there in the public consciousness that Will Rogers or Bing Crosby ever got. Though this film is more Rogers than Twain, that&apos;s not a bad thing at all.",

I am obviously not an actor, but I didn&apos;t find any problems with the acting or the dialogue. It sounded real and believable. Sure, there may moments that are corny or make you want to wince, but every movie has moments like that. Raquel Castro and Liv Tyler really stole the show, George Carlin had just the right pizzaz as a crusty old Pop, and some of us can relate to Ben Affleck&apos;s character.",

An uplifting John Waters film? Yes. He&apos;s also known for dark humor;  but this film relied on harmless shock value.\n\nEdward Furlong plays the title character, a kid who takes pictures of everything he encounters in his sleazy Baltimore neighborhood. A NY art agent (Lili Taylor) observes his work and he finds he has the choice between either rising to fame (which he loses his friends and family) or keeping his original lifestyle as a poor suburban dweller.\n\nGive this one a try: Expect nothing, and you won&apos;t be disappointed."

Caterina is a shy teenager from a small town in Italy, who moves to Rome with her long-suffering mother and her teacher father, when he is assigned to a new job there. In her new school, she has to choose to what clique to belong: the children of the progressive intellectuals or the children of the rich industrialists. The left or the right. What this film says is that these people are not terribly different between themselves. They both hold a degree of fame and power in Italian society, and look down upon those who don&apos;t. The outstanding performance in the movie is that of Caterina&apos;s father, the teacher Giancarlo (Sergio Castellito), a hothead angry that others have gotten all the breaks in life, who rants against the rich and privileged but who would sell his soul in a second in order to join the establishment. He is a familiar type of malcontent in real life but one who is seldom shown in the movies. There is a silly subplot of Caterina falling in love with an Australian boy (What they did that for? To reach an international market?), but all in all, this is one of the best Italian movies of the last years.",

Most definitely he was not in a supporting role, in fact in a cast of fine players he dominates the film as the rascally old grandfather first to Dean Stockwell and then to Tom Drake in The Green Years.\n\nIt seems like A.J. Cronin can&apos;t write a novel that won&apos;t be turned into a fine film like The Citadel and The Keys Of The Kingdom. As a writer Cronin successfully blended medicine and religion into his work in Great Britain the same as Lloyd C. Douglas on this side of the pond in Magnificent Obsession.\n\nIn this story Cronin talks about the love of medicine and science acquired at an early age. Except possibly for The Boy With Green Hair I don&apos;t think Dean Stockwell was ever more appealing on the big screen. Seems like his mother ran off with of all things an Irishman and both are dead now. So young Stockwell is taken in by his Scot relative more as an obligation than anything else. They are a thrifty lot and that&apos;s putting it mildly.\n\nThe one who Stockwell bonds with is his grandfather Coburn. He&apos;s quite the rogue and known to take a dram or three with his buddies at the tavern. But he&apos;s got more character than the rest of the family put together. Eventually when Stockwell grows up to be Tom Drake and looks to be failing in his ambitions, it&apos;s Coburn who proves to be his salvation.\n\nThe Green Years hasn&apos;t lost one inch of charm and values and it&apos;s a year older than I am. Still wonderful family viewing. Scotland pre World War II is captured beautifully here with cinematography that gained the film it&apos;s only other Oscar nomination.\n\nPoor Coburn and his fellow nominees were screwed by the Academy that year as they awarded a special Oscar to Harold Russell for his performance as the armless sailor in The Best Years Of Our Lives and then had him compete in the Best Supporting Actor category. Coburn and his fellow competitors William Demarest, Clifton Webb, and Claude Rains were at a very unfair disadvantage to Harold Russell.\n\nNot a film to be missed for family viewing time.",

      "reviewBody": "This film, although pleasant enough seems to start at a really slow pace. One may find themselves wondering when it will manage to get to its &apos;point&apos; as it were. The film shows the harmony between a community of Muslims, Jews and Christians in a small town in Tunisia. A Summer in Gaulette manages to nicely give a sense of community that transcends religious barriers, focusing on Youssef (muslim), Giuseppe (catholic), Jojo (jewish)and their three daughters. Their acceptance of the other religions around them are put to the test when their daughters are found to be interested in boys from other religious backgrounds. It manages to make us question how tolerant we really are, and the strength of friendship when fundamental beliefs are tested. In light of this film&apos;s rather heavy undertone Boughedir still manages to add elements of comedy and a rite of passage aspect in regard to the daughters. In spite of the comedy at the very end of the film a tragic and rather sobering fact is introduced. As their &apos;tolerant&apos;microcosm will face its biggest threat from the world outside. Youssef, Jojo and Giuseppe&apos;s friendship faces their biggest test yet.",

With frivolous characters, mindless lead character and utterly rubbish storyline, Mohanlal has once again succeeded in disappointing me after RBR &amp; Spirit.\n\nWhile the music is heavily plagiarized, the direction is not very good who concentrated more into his useless cameo, screenplay is like they have tried to go Tarantino, but failed. You need to be focused enough into it, if you really want to understand the plot which could&apos;ve been easily narrated in 20 minutes.\n\nWith Mumbai police flanked by Malayalam-speaking men, thousands of unanswered plot trips, coughing up sub-topics and deviating from its lead subject, Karmayodha is a very poor entertainer. The dialogs (with more beeps than ever) are clichéd and well, Lal &amp; the vindictive villains have performed well. But, that is not what Cinema is all about.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Not recommended even if you are a Lal fan like me.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES\n\nLanguage: Strong | Sex: Mediocre | Nudity: No | Violence: Strong | Gore: Critical | Smoking, Alcohol or Drugs: Mediocre",

Her masochistic love for this man is hard to believe, unless you&apos;ve been caught up in the spell of a @#$$^$*%()_ , know what I mean?  She certainly doesn&apos;t need him, financially.\n\nAnyway, Dustin Hoffman comes along playing a hard-eyed, confident newspaper man, quite against type.  He meets the wealthy owner of the paper he&apos;s stringing for eye to eye with great firmness.  The way he brings another reporter into some high faluting meeting place over the snobbish insults of the wait-staff is a beautiful and subtle thing to watch.\n\nI of course enjoyed all the English scenery at Bath, England at the old hotel there meant for folks in the old days to take different &apos;cures&apos;.  Of course, we&apos;re talking the idle rich here, and it was rather fascinating since we have our own Warm Springs, also used for similar type cures during the 30s and 40s.\n\nBuy the movie for your big screen TV, and back it up with some Merchant Ivory for a great evening of hoighty-toighty England."

Wait a sec, didn&apos;t this used to be called PHANTASM II (1988)? Or was it DARKNESS (1997)? Similarities aside, this is a pretty interesting take on the the vampire sub-genre. And, thankfully, it doesn&apos;t have the sexy vampire cliché. The vampire plague wipes out most of the world with a few surviving towns here and there. Mister, a rare vampire killer, and Martin are trying to make it a place called New Eden. Along the way they pick up strays including a nun (Kelly McGillis, looking like James Coburn) and a pregnant girl (Danielle Harris). And, of course, they run across some religious nuts led by Jebedia (Michael Cerveris). The filmmakers do bleak pretty well as this shares the same landscape as THE ROAD (2009). I could have done without the heavy handed narration from Martin, but it had to be done since, well, it was done in PHANTASM II as well."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Million Dollar Duck&quot; is a silly but fun fantasy comedy. In spite of some critics&apos; disdain for such movies - if they are for kids (they don&apos;t seem to mind the silly adult films). This one was pleasing enough for kids and adults. Disney wasn&apos;t the only studio that saw a market for such comical films mostly during the 1960s through 1980s.\n\nThe adult humor is here as well, but it may not register with many in 21st century audiences. Indeed, this film shows something of American culture that has changed. Through the middle of the last century - after WW II and well into the 1970s, one of the staples of humor was the Internal Revenue Service and government taxes. People of all stripes, but mostly common, everyday folks and hometown businessmen complained about government taxes. One couldn&apos;t go into a bar, barbershop, cafe or drug store and not hear someone lamenting the government tax burden. Government employees indeed were not very favorably regarded, whether with the IRS or not. \n\nOne suspects that the culture change by the late 20th century is what brought an end to such commonplace disdain. The transformation to mostly two-income households had lifted many more people above the subsistence level. So, most families spend more and can afford more things. Ergo, less complaint about Uncle Sam taking too much. \n\nStill, a college research professor in 1971 should have made a sufficient salary to support a family of three fairly comfortably. But, not so in this film. The name of his office on the door to Albert Dooley&apos;s (Dean Jones) lab reads, &quot;Psycho Bio Research Laboratory.&quot; All of the cast are good in their roles. Sandy Duncan is funny early on as the slightly dingy Katie Dooley. Watching her make applesauce in the kitchen is a hoot. And Dean Jones&apos;s reaction is hilarious. \n\nJames Gregory is very funny as the stuffy Treasury head. And, Edward Andrews plays the worried, angst-filled representative of the Federal Reserve Bank, Morgan, superbly. Tony Roberts is especially good as the crafty lawyer neighbor and friend who can&apos;t take his own advice. If one watches closely, there&apos;s no little amount of spoofing in this film. Not just about government agents, but lawyers and others as well. \n\nOne of the humorous criticisms I can recall from around that time had to do with government grants. One instance went something like this - while some people were out of work, others were homeless, and small businesses were struggling to keep going, the government awarded a $140,000 grant to study the mating habits of frogs. I wonder if Albert Dooley&apos;s place of employment wasn&apos;t intended as a little jab at government along those lines. \n\nThis film isn&apos;t packed with laughter scenes, or with witty lines or silly situations. It has a little bit of each, and should bring a smile to most kids and adults even well into the 21st century. \n\nIn some places, the movie is slow. And a vehicle chase scene with Jones hanging on to a utility truck ladder is quite old. It had been done in so many films before that it just doesn&apos;t seem funny this time. Here are some favorite lines. \n\nKatie Dooley, &quot;Jimmy, don&apos;t bother your father with that now. He&apos;s got little enough on his mind as it is.&quot;\n\nJimmy Dooley, &quot;Mr. Hooper next door... he has a dog. He can afford to feed it. It&apos;s a great big one.&quot; Albert Dooley, &quot;Mr. Hooper next door works for the U.S. Treasury and they have all our money. He could afford a giraffe.&quot;\n\nFinley Hooper, &quot;I wish that fool professor made enough money so I could investigate him.&quot;\n\nDr. Gottlieb, &quot;Excuse me. I have to go recheck the IQ of this chimp - a hundred and forty, higher than mine.&quot;\n\nFred Hines, &quot;Look Al, sweetheart. I&apos;m only trying to save you money. I mean by making me a partner, you&apos;ll save paying me all those exorbitant lawyer&apos;s fees.&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "The cast and story of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; are both of high quality, and they fit together well to produce one of the best war movies to be set in the Second World War. It effectively and thoughtfully presents many facets of military life - from boredom to conflict, from slapstick to sadness - without resorting to any labored or overblown material.\n\nThe cast is excellent in its own right, and the main characters are ideally matched with their roles. Henry Fonda could be no better in portraying Roberts in all his interactions with the other characters, Jack Lemmon is always entertaining as Pulver, and in Doc, William Powell gets the kind of role he played better than anyone. James Cagney is flawless as the sometimes small-minded captain, bringing out his shortcomings, yet also allowing you to understand why the character is like that.\n\nMost of the settings work well, and they help to create a believable atmosphere of navy life. The running confrontations with the palm tree and the letters are well-conceived, and they are also used effectively, getting a lot of material out of them without stretching things too far. &quot;Mr. Roberts&quot; communicates some worthwhile ideas while remaining enjoyable, and provides good entertainment and comedy without avoiding the realities in the characters&apos; lives."

      "reviewBody": "If the part where the football match takes place was omitted, &quot;Victory&quot; would be a &quot;5 stars out of 10&quot; film. The reason is that although it features two very good actors (Michael Caine - Max von Sydow), there is not much to stand out: A rather incredulous WW2 plot, an average acting (what could you expect from professional footballers or from Stallone?), and a simply decent direction, produce an average result. Thankfully, there is more than that, as I will explain in more detail later.\n\n&quot;Victory&quot; is about some inmates in a WW2 prison camp, who have a passion for soccer. Captain J. Colby (Caine), a former footballer, is the leading figure in the camp matches that take place. One day, he is spotted by football-fan Major Steiner (Max von Sydow) who proposes him the idea of organizing a match between allied POWs vs. Germans. Colby agrees, as he believes this will be a great morale-booster and a chance for better prison conditions for those involved; however, more senior inmates are skeptical, as they believe this will be a propaganda stunt for the Germans. In the end, they also concur but only after they have convinced the team&apos;s goalie Capt. Hatch (Stallone) to arrange the team&apos;s escape during the match. The difficulty is that both Colby and his team are more interested in this game than in their freedom, so they are hesitant on what they should finally do...\n\nAs I said, the movie is just watchable during its first part. And yet, when we start to watch the Allied - Germans match, things get much better: We watch terrific football from stars such as Pele, Ardiles, and Bobby Moore, with scenes such as Pele&apos;s goal being memorable to all sports fans. Of course, if you are not into soccer, then perhaps you won&apos;t get that excited (although the spectacle can be exciting for non-fans, too). But if you like the King of Sports, then you will certainly enjoy this film. 7/10.",

The rest of the cast is for the most part European players who most of you have never heard of filling out the cast of The Christmas Kid.\n\nIn the title role is Hunter who was born on Christmas Day hence the title. But he hardly takes after the guy who the holiday celebrates the birth of though he once played him in a different film. Mother died at birth, father blames him for her loss and Hunter grows up without any firm foundations.\n\nStill he&apos;s a popular hell raiser and when the small town becomes a boom town because of a rich vein of copper Hunter becomes the sheriff. A corrupt sheriff to be sure, doing the bidding of gambling hall owner Louis Hayward who arrived and built his dance hall gambling palace when the copper boom started. But soon enough Hunter stands against Hayward and for real law and order.\n\nBoth Hunter and Hayward have seen better days. Hunter was a favorite of John Ford who used him in The Searchers, The Last Hurrah, and Sergeant Rutledge. Jeff must have known this was hardly going to be a John Ford western. I believe this was the first western for Louis Hayward who could play good and bad guys equally well, but also in better films. Both these guys have the look of men waiting for their paychecks to clear.\n\nFans of both will be disappointed.",

If you&apos;ve seen any of them then you should know that many of the same topics are covered but I will say that this one here was handled extremely well and I would say this is one of the better produced videos out there.\n\nThe main target of attacks are the collapsing buildings, the fact that the hole in the Pentagon wasn&apos;t big enough for a plane strike and how several of the supposed terrorists were later found alive. There are other bits of evidence that are covered but the documentary really focuses on these events including if it was some sort of explosion that brought down the World Trade Centers.\n\nI love watching conspiracy theory videos whether I agree with them or not. Sometimes they are really horribly produced and sound like some sort of nut just going off on weird ideas. I will say that this video at least presents a clear case to where you can question what really happened. That&apos;s not to say I believed everything that was said here but it&apos;s presented in a way to where you can at least think these people are serious and aren&apos;t just some sort of nut.\n\nThe stuff dealing with the Pentagon is the most believable and especially since there&apos;s not been any evidence that a plane was used. There&apos;s an interesting bit about some people inside the World Trade Center who were burned yet they were no where near where the planes hit. All of this is quite interesting so fans of this type of documentary should enjoy this one."

      "reviewBody": "Epic in plot, setting and length, Fiddler on the Roof tells a surprisingly tight and focused story that has &quot;universal&quot; poignancy--in a nutshell, it&apos;s about trying to maintain strong cultural traditions and identity in the face of a continually changing world, partially fueled by the youth, that doesn&apos;t necessarily share the culture&apos;s values or self-assessment of worth.\n\nThe plot is based on short stories written around the turn of the 20th Century by Sholom Aleichem, who was often called the &quot;Russian Mark Twain&quot;. Aleichem wrote a number of works based on his character Tevye the Milkman, who has seven daughters (in the film, this was pared down to five). They live in the fictional Jewish shtetl (&quot;village&quot;, or &quot;little town or city&quot;) of Anatevka in Tsarist Russia in the early 1900s. The stories are &quot;slice of life&quot; stuff. A lot of attention is paid to Tevye&apos;s daughters and their potential suitors. One of the prominent conflicts with tradition is a struggle with arranged marriages versus marriages for love, but of course, being set in pre-revolutionary Russia, there are also political changes brewing, some of which have a profound affect on Tevye&apos;s family and village.\n\nAleichem&apos;s Tevye stories were first turned into a Broadway musical, which began its initial run in 1964 with Zero Mostel as Tevye. Producer and director Norman Jewison, who had had success with films like In the Heat of the Night (1967) and The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), and who was experienced as a producer and director for musical-oriented televisions shows, including &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; (1960), was asked around early 1970 by United Artists to helm the Fiddler on the Roof film. To their surprise, Jewison wasn&apos;t Jewish. He got the gig anyway, and in August 1970, began an arduous shoot--much of it done in a small village in Yugoslavia that refused to cooperate when it came to weather (Jewison couldn&apos;t get the snow he wanted). He ended up getting a lot of pressure because the shoot went over time and over budget--this was one of the most expensive films of its time, which was an era of economic woes for Hollywood--but of course we know it paid off in the end.\n\nZero Mostel was out as Tevye, and Israeli actor Chaim Topol, or just &quot;Topol&quot;, was in, based largely on Jewison seeing him in the role of Tevye in the London stage production of Fiddler. Jewison had said that he was shooting for more realism in the film, as opposed to what he saw as a kind of campy humor in the Broadway production.\n\nIn my eyes, Jewison ended up with a bit of both approaches in his finished film, but that&apos;s all for the better. Sequences like the opening &quot;Tradition&quot; montage are hilarious in their juxtaposition of a grand operatic attitude and the rhythmic coordination of cleaning fish, hanging slabs of meat, and so on. Yes, a lot of Fiddler is very realistic, but it&apos;s equally humorous and surrealistic most of the time.\n\nThe realism is largely thanks to the authentic settings, the fabulous production and costume design, and of course, the superb performances. The humor is a factor of the above with that Mark Twain-ish aspect of Aleichem&apos;s stories and the fine script by Joseph Stine.\n\nThe surrealism comes largely by way of the cinematography. Some of the visual sense is reminiscent of Marc Chagall&apos;s early work and his later, nostalgic depictions of his native Russia, and in fact, the image of the fiddler on the roof comes directly from a Chagall painting. Jewison saw the fiddler as a cross between a metaphor for the Jewish spirit (and this is explained in more detail via a few lines of dialogue in the film) and an actual physical manifestation of a spirit. However we interpret the fiddler, the shots of him and his presence in the film are certainly poetic. Jewison also gives us some fabulous, surreal, wide landscape shots, such as those of agricultural fields and the beautiful &quot;wasteland&quot; in which the train tracks are set. There are a few scenes set on the banks of a river, overlooked by a bridge, that are reminiscent of particular Van Gogh paintings. And as a more subtle bit of surrealism, Jewison had cinematographer Oswald Morris shoot much of the film though a woman&apos;s stocking--the mesh is very clearly visible in some exterior shots. Of course, there are also a couple more surrealistic touches in the plot, my favorite being the Tevye&apos;s Dream sequence, which features traditionalist Jewish zombies in an operatic attitude.\n\nA musical couldn&apos;t be a 10 without great music, and Fiddler on the Roof has it. The songs are a marvelous melding of traditional Russian folk melodies, with appropriate twinges of Orientalism and the expected Broadway sound, but maybe leaning a bit closer to a modern opera. From that description, you might think that the music would be a mess, but all of the songs are inventive and catchy. They are seamlessly melded with the drama, furthering the narrative as they should. The choreography is excellent and it is well shot by Jewison. And Isaac Stern&apos;s violin solos are outstanding, of course.\n\nFiddler on the Roof takes an investment of time--it&apos;s three hours long, but it&apos;s well worth it. It offers great drama, great music, great humor and great tragedy in a beautiful package--you&apos;ll laugh, you&apos;ll cry, you&apos;ll sing, and you just might break a leg trying to dance.",

      "reviewBody": "Out of each of Ilyenko&apos;s first three feature films, The White Bird Marked with Black is the most accessible. It finds a middle ground between A Spring for the Thirsty&apos;s stark minimalism and Eve of Ivan Kupalo&apos;s surreal maximalism. This middle ground shows an Ilyenko who got his craziest experiments out of the way, brilliant though they were, and is more interested now in producing a more conventional narrative. Perhaps Soviet censorship also had to do with the more conventional narrative; the previous films were big enough risks that resulted in censorship so it&apos;d be understandable to want a bit of a break. The worldview of the film is less at odds with the Soviet line, although this may reflect Ilyenko&apos;s thinking rather than Soviet pressure: sometimes to survive, a people has to adapt, however painful the adaptation may be.\n\nAlthough it has a more conventionally told narrative than Ilyenko&apos;s other films, it&apos;s not an easy film per se and watching it benefits from at least a bit of rough knowledge of the time period it&apos;s set in. Showing the effects of war on the peasant population, it focusses on a group of brothers and a few other characters, showing how their reactions to the constant territorial change differs. In one amusing scene, the father explains why he has so many different clocks: one for the time zone of each of the countries that take over the territory, so that he doesn&apos;t have to keep changing the time when a different empire takes over.\n\nAlthough The White Bird Marked With Black is not directed in such an unconventional way as his previous two films are, Ilyenko maintains his good eye for colour. The composition of most of the shots is simply stunning. Even the indoor scenes are beautifully presented. Camera movement also makes some scenes very fluid. The camera is positioned on the end of fast-moving rafts and during dance scenes it gracefully spins around the dancers, mimicking their movements.\n\nThis is a complex film, and beneath the surface there is a wealth of themes, exploring the preservation national identity, futile resistance and adaptation. It&apos;s rich in meaning. The overall intention behind this film is more nuanced than Ilyenko&apos;s previous work. Just as Ilyenko no doubt had to make difficult choices to get it passed by censors, a people must sometimes make difficult choices in order to survive.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Resiklo&quot; (literally, &quot;Recycle&quot;) certainly wouldn&apos;t be the worst film this side of the planet you&apos;d see this time of the year. But any hope that this mega-budgeted movie (at least by Philippine standards) would enthrall will depend on how high you place your expectations as much as where you place them. This Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) entry offers a grand production design and decent CGI although the robots are only fun in small doses. Keep your expectations at bay and that may suffice to vindicate P120 off your pocket. But it&apos;s still a sad shadow of what could have been a terrifically tense Filipino sci-fi.\n\nIn 2021, the Earth is invaded by alien beings (Balangs) who then engage humankind into a worldwide war, destroying all the planet&apos;s natural resources in the process. In a post-apocalyptic Philippines, a band of survivors live in an undisclosed place they call &quot;Paraiso,&quot; an underground society so hidden everyone else thinks it&apos;s a myth. Nevertheless, the people of this place fend themselves through their sheer ingenuity, using recycled scraps they regularly scavenge from the outside world for their basic necessities.\n\nBut eventually their hideout is located by the Mutanos, a group of beings who were once humans, but were converted by the Balangs into a superior mutated sentient. A chance encounter between Crisval (Bong Revilla), one of the residents of &quot;Paraiso,&quot; and the son of the leader of the Mutanos leads to the death of the latter, and ignites the wrath of the Mutanos and wages a war against the humans.\n\nThe concept is actually fun but the perfunctory and predictable script, plus the embarrassingly wooden acting from Revilla limp this film right out of the door. Written and directed by Mark Reyes, &quot;Resiklo&quot; was supposedly pitched as an idea for a television series, but eventually landed onto the big screen courtesy of Senator Bong Revilla, who stars and co-produces. Reyes has a comparatively more coherent hold of the narrative this time than in &quot;Mulawin: The Movie&quot; two years back, but the rush to cover the expansive mythology shows through this anecdotal sort of a movie, following a number of characters from plot point to plot point but not offering a whole lot on the way of a sensible story. And the dialogues are written in dreadfully serious manners, it&apos;s hard not to force a groan when Revilla utters lines like &quot;Overstaying na kayo, dapat na kayong i-deport (You should be deported for overstaying)!&quot; \n\nThis leads to the film&apos;s biggest problem: it&apos;s boring. There&apos;s action scenes to be sure, but most of the film involves people walking around looking for scraps and faux-politicians talking about what they intend to do next to survive. The bland dramatic scenes then are punctuated by action scenes that are awkwardly edited and painfully lacking in the sort of visual detail that really makes them adrenaline-pumping. The movie&apos;s selling point of robots battling each other occur so short and so fast, and the rendering of the animation is at times so inorganic it&apos;s distracting. Personally, only one fight scene stands out and surprisingly it&apos;s that of Empress Schuck, where her blind character fights off Mutanos soldiers with her walking cane. Sexy.\n\nWhich makes you wish that the girl gets more butt-kicking screen time. Or maybe instead of playing a doctor (which takes a lot of time buying into), Michelle Madrigal were cast in the lead role wearing skimpy outfits, gunning the enemies out, ala Milla Jovovich. It wouldn&apos;t make the movie anymore logical, but it certainly would make it more interesting.",

      "reviewBody": "Spike Jones once said that his material was too corny for sophisticated people but too sophisticated for corny people.  Woody Allen&apos;s material can lend itself to similar critique.  Mighty Aphrodite has a superb balance between sophistication and corn.\n\nThe Greek chorus idea is very well used, both at a sophisticated level - the film is essentially a modernised Greek drama - and at a corn level (when the chorus morphed into a more Broadway-style chorus Janie avoided the cheese by going into the kitchen and uncorking the wine). The Greek myth theme is well done throughout - I loved the appeal to Zeus especially.  Also the deus ex machina resolution was terrific fun, although I think not entirely original (I believe it was Cocteau who previously used the helicopter as a visual deus ex machina).  \n\nFine performances - Mira Sorvino is a super &quot;tart with a heart&quot;.  Even Helena Bonham Carter is more effectively used in this film than in her standard Merchant Ivory roles, although I thought she lacked chemistry with Woody.  Good also to see F Murray Abraham as the leader of the chorus - why do we see so little of him these days?\n\nI&apos;m a fan of Woody, but he has been patchy in the last 10 years or so.  With this one, he really was in sparkling form.  Well worth seeing.",

If this film were not a 2nd Green Street i feel the reviews would be more positive. The storyline is not bad and i actually quite approve of it. The characters are very approachable and although it is a bit disappointing that only one Green Street original is in it, you find your self feeling pity on some and hating the guts of others. The violence is in abundance but i don&apos;t actually feel it is too much. Yes it makes you cringe but film such as SAW contain much more gore than this film.\n\nIn summary its not a great film, lets clear that up, but it is equally not as bad as people suggest. An acceptable film that offers nothing special but is not at all badly made. 6/10",

I have travelled a lot by hitch-hike around the USSR and seen what the life was like there. I know the grim Russian reality first-hand.\n\nThat is why I disagree with a comment saying that Born American &quot;is a bad, bad film and it&apos;s made worse by the fact that it portrays every level of Russian society in a very unflattering manner&quot;.\n\nIn fact, the film is realistic -- therefore its portrait of the Russian society is unflattering. The Finnish producer seems to know much more about the real life in Russia than many in the West. Later the film turns into an &apos;action&apos;. But the general picture of the Soviet-time Russia is true.\n\nUntil the Soviet bloc collapsed this film could not be demonstrated here: it was banned. Moreover, Moscow made a protest to the Finnish government, even demanding that the film be banned from cinemas in Finland! Can there be a better proof that the film demonstrates the Soviet/Russian reality in a honest way?\n\nIndeed, for a person in the West it may be hard to believe that such reality can exist. But may I tell you that an elderly Estonian exile once told of having cried watching a film about Russian slave labour camps, while other western audience laughed. People just couldn&apos;t believe it was possible -- but she knew, and she cried.\n\nValeri Kalabugin Tallinn, Estonia"

The plot: a renegade cop, Jack (David Bradley, great B-action-flick guy) goes into the jungle (in Jamaica I think), to find his lost brother, who has been turned into a cyborg by a charismatic bad guy, Kessel (played by John Rhys-Davies in perhaps one of his best roles ever) - while looking for him, Jack encounters many bad guys whose asses he must kick, and he also scores with some bimbo (Played by Alonna Shaw, who probably is a nice person in real life, but p*ssed me off in the movie) \n\nThe Highlight of the movie is the Evil Cyborg, Quincy (played by Rufus Swart, who I don&apos;t think said a single word during the entire movie..and it appears to be his last movie too!) - he has this really cool knife-glove he puts on to slash his enemies, looks great! \n\nI won&apos;t reveal to much about the movie, go see it! It&apos;s brilliant! I laughed my ass of, especially at the end, when Jack fools Kessel..it&apos;s brilliantly written and conceived! (or maybe not)\n\nI give this movie 6/10, because it&apos;s very entertaining, but still a crap-flick though...the tourist-bag Jack wears throughout the movie looked so silly, maybe that&apos;s why the bad guys aren&apos;t afraid of him, because he looks like a total wussy, with a gold belt... John Rhys-Davies has a lot of good lines, and he steals EVERY scene he&apos;s in.. the same goes whenever Rufus Swart is in a scene, his foamy rubber &quot;cyborg-legs/arms&quot; looks hilariously cheap!\n\nHEY!

When the lecher but powerful Georges Brignon (Charles Dullin) harasses and invites Jenny for dinner promising a role in a film, Maurice goes to the restaurant and threatens Brignon. A couple of days later, Jenny tells Maurice that she is going to visit her grandmother in another town. However, her husband finds a piece of paper hidden in the kitchen with Brignon&apos;s address. Maurice goes to the theater to have an alibi and heads to Brignon&apos;s manor during the show with the intention of killing the old man. However, he finds Brignon&apos;s house open and the man dead on the floor. When he leaves the crime scene, his car is stolen and Maurice has to walk back to the theater. Meanwhile, Jenny arrives in the house of the lesbian photographer Dora Monier (Simone Renant), who is an old friend of Maurice and has a crush on Jenny, and tells Dora that she has just killed Brignon. But Jenny notes that she had forgotten her fur on the couch in the living room of Brignon&apos;s house and Dora takes a cab to retrieve the stole. Inspector Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is assigned to investigate the case and sooner he visits Jenny, Maurice and Dora to check their alibis for that night in the beginning of his investigation. \n\n&quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot; is an amusing story of an efficient detective investigating a murder in a comedy of errors of the three lead suspects. Henri-Georges Clouzot is one of the best French directors ever and &quot;Quais des Orfèvres&quot; is another gem in his filmography. The witty screenplay has many twists and is supported by the magnificent cinematography in black-and-white and awesome performances. Bernard Blier, the father of Bertrand Blier, is perfect in the role of a jealous cuckold without confidence in his wife and self-respect. Suzy Delair performs an ambitious woman that has a past with lovers and wants to climb positions in the show-business, but loves her husband. Simone Renant is great in the role of a lesbian photographer. But who steals the film is Louis Jouvet, in the role of a detective that seems to be naive, but is capable to find the truth that each character intends to hide. My understanding is that Antoine might be gay since he does not like women. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Crime em Paris&quot; (&quot;Crime in Paris&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "I grew up watching the old Inspector Gadget cartoon as a kid. It was like Get Smart for kids. Bumbling boob can&apos;t solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard the live action movie was decent so I checked it out at the library. I rented this movie for free and felt I should have been paid to see this.\n\nBroderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting Don Adams had as the voice of gadget. His voice was all wrong. The girl who played Penny looked nothing like the cartoon Penny. She is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. But she does do a decent job given what she had to work with. Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby. Saldy he never hid in any odd place or had exploding messages tossed at him accidently by Gadget.\n\nThe gadget mobile was wrong. It never talked in the series and it did fine. Why did they do this?\n\nGadget was too intelligent in this film. In the show he was a complete idiot. Here he had a halfway decent intellect. It would have worked better if he was a moron.\n\nAlso the completely butchered the catchphrase. Borderick says &quot;Wowser&quot;. It is and should always be &quot;Wowsers&quot;. It sounds lame with out the &apos;s&apos;. I got upset when they showed the previews and they didn&apos;t have the correct phrase.\n\nThe ONLY decent gags were during the credits. The lacky for Claw is in front of a support group for recovering henchmen/sidekicks. Seated in the audience is Mr. T, Richard Keil aka Jaws of Bond movie fame, a Herve Villacheze look alike, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is about the only part I laughed at.\n\n The other is at the end where Penny is checking out here gadget watch and tells brain to say somethin. Don Adams voices the dog saying that &quot;Brain isn&apos;t in right now. Please leave your name at the sound of the woof. Woof.&quot; of course this isn&apos;t laugh out loud funny, just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. He should have at least voiced the stupid car.\n\nKids will like this, anyone over 13 won&apos;t.",

      "reviewBody": "Everyone is familiar with William Shakespeare&apos;s boy-meets-girl love story, and it has already been interpreted into films, plays, TV adaptations and songs. But Baz Luhrmann gives this world-known love story a modern-day twist, setting it in Verona Beach, and piling on the religious imagery. The result is quite spectacular.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes play the star-crossed lovers, and, whilst the latter is sadly a little bland, never truly convincing us in her portrayal of Juliet&apos;s loss of innocence or torment of feelings towards the foe, DiCaprio completely redeems her performance. He is a revelation. His Romeo is a wonderful mix of sad eloquence, a loving heart and a troubled soul, and all these elements come together beautifully in a performance hotter than a pepper sprout, with more layers than the proverbial onion. He is the very embodiment of sexy in his role. There is an extremely alluring way in which his character is filmed, which only enhances Romeo as a lover. This is epitomized in the opening shot of him, where the Leo is illuminated illustriously against the sunlight, and Radiohead&apos;s languid, sexy tune &quot;Talk Show Host&quot; plays.\n\nThe film itself has &quot;sexy&quot; written all over it, and, with the Gen X teenagers as his target audience, I don&apos;t think Luhrmann would have things any other way. But, unlike with that atrocity Moulin Rouge!, with Romeo + Juliet, the over-stylization is appropriate, making the movie more accessible to teens, for example, through gun warfare rather than swordplay, and the canny symbolisation of Queen Mab as a drug. But perhaps the most ingenious stylistic technique here is the slap-in-face Shakespearean references, which range from a ball called the Merchant of Venice, to &apos;Such stuff as dreams are made on&apos; from The Tempest, making the film an absolute goldmine for trivia fans.\n\nStyle aside, there is more than enough substance. Romeo is presented exactly as the play does  at first, the mawkish, gawky, lovesick teenager, then, the fickle boy, and finally, the devoted and caring lover, and much of this loyalty to the play is due to the screenplay from Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, which maintains the original memorable dialogue and descriptions, but also dares to stray from the sidewalk in some of the plot turns, and the film completely benefits from it. The set designs are intricate and beautiful, and suit every frame of the film perfectly, and the icing on the cake is the music. Craig Armstrong&apos;s score for the swimming pool scene is as stunning as it is original, and the use of non-original music, from Kym Mazelle to The Cardigans, give the film the added edge of cool, making Romeo + Juliet one of the boldest, sassiest and most unforgettable adaptations to date, and English Lit. GCSE has been made far more digestible for us kids across England. It&apos;s what Shakespeare would have wanted. A-.",

      "reviewBody": "While I enjoy the old Shirley Temple films, I am occasionally shocked at how depressing and scary many of the plots were. In one, she is separated from her father and is pursued by a creepy guy who keeps offering to take her out and buy her candy, in MANY she&apos;s an orphan and in this one she&apos;s in the middle of two parents who are divorcing! Family-friendly, perhaps, but definitely films with a dark side.\n\nIn this film, it begins with the Middleton family being happy as can be. Their daughter, Molly (Temple) is adored and everything seems just peachy. However, over time you notice that Dr. Middleton (Joel McCrea) is often so wrapped up in his work that he neglects his sweet wife, Elsa (Rosemary Ames). It&apos;s obvious to everyone but him that his wife is lonely and needs him. Eventually, she sets her eyes on the Doc&apos;s best friend, Rolfe Brent (Lyle Talbot) and soon she and Brent are in love...and she&apos;s seeking a divorce! Molly naturally is effected by all this and eventually runs away! Will these dopey parents give up their selfish ways and make a family for Molly once again? What do you think?!\n\nLike so many of Shirley&apos;s films, this one is an obvious object lesson on good parenting and the importance of family. So, despite being a tiny bit traumatic, it does all end well and emphasizes good old fashioned values. It is a bit of a departure, though, as in this one Shirley does NOT sing and the film has a much more compact plot than usual...hence its very short running time compared to her other full-length films. Well worth seeing and sweet.",

Aidan Quinn was fantastic, it was nice to see him a role that was very original. After we watched the movie we went in search of the soundtrack. The music and lyrics were very haunting, and gave a good look into how life was like for this particular group of people.\n\nIf you are looking for a movie that is beautiful, thoughtful, endearing, and is filled with original and stirring music this is a must see for you! Even my boyfriend liked it, and he strays from watching many of these artsy films!"

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Ice Cold in Alex&apos; is an absorbing story of a British ambulance trying to get to safety in the North African desert. There is the heat, minefields, enemy troops, more heat, shifting sands and human weaknesses to contend with and at the end of the film (over two hours)one feels exhausted. The main characters are an army captain on the verge of a breakdown, a determined nurse, a solid sergeant major and a South African soldier whom they pick up on the way. With simple heroism they try making their way to their goal, which in this case is a glass of ice cold beer in Alexandria on the coast.\n\nThe interplay between the characters and the growing bond they have in adversity is well played by the actors. John Mills&apos; deeply troubled captain is particularly well acted. Harry Andrews, Anthony Quayle and Sylvia Syms are fine too. The other main character is the ambulance itself, gradually coming to pieces on the way, steaming and bumping along.\n\nJ. Lee Thompson was a very able director and there are some excellent scenes here. The minefield scene near the beginning and the hill scene near the end are great, tense and emotional. The beer scene is moving and uplifting. The best British films about the Second World War are generally about a small group of ordinary people who faced with crisis and peril just get on with it.",

Her audition goes badly when her concentration is broken by a commotion involving the head of the jury Ariane Fouchécourt (Catherine Frot), a renowned concert performer who behaves badly towards the aspiring pianist. Ten years pass, and Mélanie (now played by Déborah François) lands a coveted job at a law firm working for Monsieur Fouchécourt (Pascal Greggory). Mélanie makes a big impression on her patron, and she is recruited as an au-pair at his estate. She quickly becomes an indispensable member of the family, and intimate with Pascal&apos;s wife, who by now is struggling to maintain her illustrious career. Melanie is recruited to turn the pages of music during the make-or-break performance by Ariane and revenge appears to be the order of the day. An absolutely stunning performance by Belgian actress Déborah François, who was the lead in the award-winning L&apos;Infant last year. Dercourt&apos;s use of silence to convey meaning and intention is remarkable, and has led to comparisons with the legendary Claude Chabrol (who directed L&apos;Enfer with Emmanuelle Béart.)",

The admiral, as new Alexey Nevski and the nasty Bolsheviks, the traitor and the end of beautiful love story. But the real Kolchak is in dark. For be a masterpiece, the film must be for good taste of public. So, the history is only convention. The hero , the elegant lady, few details as bones of a huge story are enough. Therefore, it is difficult to criticize this production. Its strenghts are so numerous that any accusation is ridiculous. The Soviet enthusiasm for great fresco, the Russian way to see the life and the tragedy as atonement are key for images of a world end by an old definition."

The basic foundation of the Heman woman hater club shakes down when one of their member,Alfaalfa,  falls for Darla and there it all starts the fight for Darla and the story moves ..... When the movie is over there is something which makes u feel good.Director penelope spheeris completely justifies the subject the movie needed a good screenplay and its brilliant in the movie. Overall a good delightful movie to watch."

Very tomboyish but still gorgeous and her demeanor and acting ability far surpass her years.  Niven is great fun playing several roles, all while trying to keep a straight face.  Fight scene near end perhaps a bit overlong and typical, but maintains some humour.  Average script is made up for with strong, tender performances in a children&apos;s movie (which probably only appeals to adults, now)which surprisingly is not emotionally manipulative.  7/10",

The story revolves around three long-time friends, two of whom are feuding who camp out on their old stomping ground of Black Rock to reconnect only their party is interrupted by three men who we learn have been dishonorable discharged from the army and aren&apos;t exactly friendly.\n\nAll hell breaks loose and the three heroines are hunted down. It&apos;s nothing we haven&apos;t seen before but the poor reviews are surprisingly poor for what seemed like a decent little movie. It has its flaws but character and the suspense are both there and the ladies Aselton(Abby) who also happens to be the director gave it a solid effort. Lake Bell (Lou) with and Kate Bosworth their roles exceptionally well for this story which never goes too over the top and stays believable for the most part.\n\nIt won&apos;t be winning any major awards but in my books it was a good survival story which had me interested all the way to the end.\n\n6/10 (though rated 7 because it was better than people say it is)",

That being said, it does feature the standard &quot;Grier sleeps her way to the top of crime syndicate&quot;, a plot ripped off of Coffy.  With scenes like the famous &quot;Afro as holster&quot; sequence and the inclusion of a Black Panther-esque anti-drug group this movie is fun from start to finish.

Wilson acts recklessly on the job, endangering his partners, and rubs rulebook cop Norton the wrong way. Wilson&apos;s cowboy attitude causes the death of a colleague.\n\nHe loses his LAPD job and resorts to the underworld and a mob boss (Chris Penn) for the income he needs to stay afloat.  Inevitably Wilson&apos;s lapse into crime collides with his former life and his friends on the Force.  The movie&apos;s best heroic support comes from Norton, who effectively balances his character&apos;s integrity with the jealously he harbors for Wilson&apos;s higher rank.  &quot;Cybertracker&quot; was the last Norton- Wilson pairing, in which they played adversaries, and this picture demonstrates that a movie can always use two great screen heroes. Though the screen time shared by martial arts legends Norton, Wilson &amp; Rothrock is brief, &quot;Redemption&quot; will get an extended cheer from fans.",

      "reviewBody": "Finally after a long wait we can see the original version of &quot;Dementia&quot; which was re released two years later as &quot;Daughter of Horror&quot; , cut by two minutes and featured the notoriously bad voice over by the unknown (outside america) Ed McMahon , which was added as the re releasers thought that the public would not understand what was going on , it did the opposite and has unfairly given the film a bad reputation. Since the re release was shown , the film itself has pretty much disappeared and only terrible prints on the 1957 version have been available , giving a brief glimpse of what this film could have been. But now the full version has been released by Kino Films on DVD. The print is stunning (compared to the previously available anything would be preferable), and the restoration of the nightmarish &quot;jazzey&quot; score is fault less. &quot;Dementia&quot; and &quot;Daughter of Horror&quot; (it was given a more salatious title to get audiences in) are both on the disc...with some great extras its worth a look. The story itself is a living/dreaming nightmare , the boundaries are jarred from the first scene as we pan in from the empty street into the apartment window and track up to the bed. The Gammin wakes and looks as if she has just had a bad nightmare , she gets up and walks over to a drawer , opens it and pulls out a switchblade , she looks down and sneers , pockets the knife and goes out into the night. From here on we either know that she it totally insane or that she is out to protect herself or both. We follow her journey into bars and meetings with pimps and flower sellers. I wont tell you anymore about it , otherwise it will spoil the fun of finding out for yourself but this film is a must and belongs on any serious collectors shelf.",

This is one of those movies that I would love to have seen in the theaters. If you enjoy enjoy martial arts pictures or just plain ole fighting movies, then you won&apos;t want to miss this one. The story line made sense unlike some others that are sometimes hard to follow. The only thing that I would loved to have seen be different is the lines from Pinball. I think his lines were a little overkill. The writers could have toned it down a little because he wasn&apos;t really funny if that&apos;s what they were trying to portrait.",

As you may have guessed I loved the musical numbers.\n\nWhy have so many people dissed this movie? I understand that this is a remake of the Wedding Singer. Although I have not seen the Wedding Singer I cannot imagine Adam Sandler playing anything other than a jack ass and any movie he is in as anything but a piece of ignorant garbage. Our Man Salman took his role and made it into a reasonably intelligent and emotional character. I was especially impressed with his emotional portrayal as Prem when he lost the girls, I almost cried with him! Our Man in particular and Bollywood in general have a knack for turning Hollywood ridiculousness into something dignified. He did overdo it playing the drunk though.\n\nRani Mukerji was fantastic. She has the right combination of beauty, sexiness, earthiness and heart to make a great romantic love interest.\n\nThe portrayal of the close knit and loving family and neighborhood added a lot to the emotional appeal of the movie. All of the characters were people that I liked and cared about.\n\nI did not find the movie that funny, but found it to be a good love story."

      "name": "Delicious Ravioli with Chorizo Western ,  being well  co-produced by Italy and Spain",
      "reviewBody": "Moving and dramatic Macaroni/Paella Western about a violent feud among sons , mother and her lover . Spanish-Italian co-production with Spaghetti-heroes as Leonard Mann , Peter Martell against Luciana Paluzzi and Albert De Mendoza . An Italian-Spanish co-production full of action , exaggerated characters, gun-play and lots of violence . In the beginning of the movie returning from Civil War , general Jose Carrasco (Jose Suarez) is double-crossed and takes place an ambush, in which is killed by his unscrupulous spouse Anna (Luciana Paluzzi) and her lover named Tomas (Alberto De Mendoza) . The sole survivor named Sebastian of a slaughter seeks vendetta . Years later, grown-up Sebastian (Leonard Mann) has become a magnificent and fast-hand gunman. One day Rafael (Prieto Martellanz or Peter Martell) goes back to Texas , where Sebastian resides , and brings back the terrible records of Sebastian&apos;s infancy . Rafael, who is the lover of Sebastian&apos;s sister Isabel (Pilar Velazquez), insistently chased by Anna Carrasco&apos;s hoodlums (Jose Riesgo, Piero Lulli), and Sebastian agrees to join him back to his mother&apos;s estate in order to rescue his sister from their mommy and to avenge his daddy&apos;s death . After suffering atrocity , both of whom execute a single-handedly revenge , they hit , ravage and kill each person involved in the massacre . Follows the exploits of Sebastian Carrasco and Rafael Garcia in SW usual theme, &apos;revenge&apos; . For pleasure, for avenge, don&apos;t care why they kills or how . They are relentless in their vendetta , deadly in his violence . The conflict is simple one between two avengers and a Baron land with his hoodlums , oppressors, nasty bandits . \n\nIt&apos;s an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonists Leonard Mann , Peter Martell and the enemy , Alberto De Mendoza, and his underlings . Leonard Mann is fine, he ravages the screen, he shoots , hits and run and ultimately takes the law on his own hands . Alberto De Mendoza as a cruelly baddie role is terrific, subsequently he would play similar characters in various oaters . Furthermore, appears usual secondary actors from Italian/Spanish Western as Jose Suarez , Jose Riesgo ,Franco Pesce , Jose Luis Martin , Luciano Rossi ,Enzo Fiermonte , and several others. Brief appearance of future Spahetti secondary myth , Piero Lulli . The film blends violence, blood, tension, family drama , high body-count and it&apos;s fast moving and quite entertaining . There is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing a shootout or stunt every few minutes . This is a good Spaghetti Western with some moments genuinely entertaining if you can avoid thinking too much . The musician Roberto Pregadio composes a vibrant soundtrack in Morricone style and well conducted ; including a catching leitmotif and considered to be one of the best . Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors, dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine sets with striking cinematography in Eastmancolor with negative regularly processed , being necessary a right remastering . Interior filmed in Elios Studios (Rome) and outdoor sequences filmed on location in Lacio (Rome) along with Almeria, where in the 60s and 70s were shot innumerable Spaghetti.\n\nIt&apos;s a Western freely based on famous Orestes myth . According to Pindar, the young Orestes (here played by Leonard Mann) was saved by his nurse Arsinoe or his sister Electra (here Pilar Velazquez) , who conveyed him out of the country when Clytemnestra (Luciana Paluzzi) wished to kill him. In the familiar theme of the hero&apos;s early eclipse and exile, he then escaped to Mount Parnassus . In his twentieth year, he was urged by Electra to return home and avenge his father&apos;s death. He returned home along with his friend Pylades (Peter Martell) . The same myth is told differently by Sophocles and Euripides in their Electra plays. Other Spaghetti based on known and classic novels and plays , are the following : ¨Johnny Hamlet¨(1968) by Enzo G Castellari ; ¨The return of Ringo¨ by Duccio Tessari inspired on the ¨Odyssey¨, ¨John Il Bastardo¨(1967) based on books from Zorrilla and Moliere ; ¨Fury of Johnny Kid¨by Gianni Puccini based on Shakespeare&apos;s Romeo and Juliet and ¨Anche Nel West Céra una Volta Dio ¨ (1968) by Marino Girolami¨based on ¨Island of treasure¨ by Robert Stevenson. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Ferdinando Baldi . Baldi was a craftsman who directed all kind genres but especially Western such as &quot;Carambola&apos;s Philosophy: In the Right Pocket&quot; , &quot;Django, Prepare a Coffin&quot; , ¨Adios Texas¨ , ¨Rita in the West¨ and of course this ¨Il Pistolero dell&apos;Ave Maria&quot; or USA original title) &quot;Forgotten Pistolero&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "I did make a bad start with this six part series. On YouTube they are divided into three programmes, each of two episodes, the first and third shown in different order to the IMDb listing. So until the penny dropped I watched part of The New Accelerator wondering where is Mr Brownlow and his newspaper. The basic idea of The New Accelerator (which I score 8) was used in the Star Trek episode Wink of an Eye, as far as I know there was no plagiarism.\n\nAt the time of writing Mr Brownlow&apos;s Newspaper is the most highly rated, with which I agree, deserving a 10. Re-living past events, and returning again to try to correct the past when things fail to happen as they should, has a flavour of Groundhog Day and, how can I put it, takes less time about it.\n\nThe most light hearted, almost Chaplin slapstick, is The Truth about Pyecraft, a good 7. The lovelorn fatty, having decided on suicide, is meticulous enough to calculate the optimum length of rope but he attaches it to a chandelier, which probably wouldn&apos;t support a large dog. I&apos;d award another 7 to The Stolen Bacillus. I&apos;m not one to let plot hole pedantry prevent enjoyment of a good story. But I did wonder why the thief immediately poured it into the reservoir , without even knowing what it was, rather than demand a ransom for its return. The Crystal Egg and The Remarkable Case of Davidson&apos;s Eyes aren&apos;t so good, I&apos;d rate them 6 and 5 respectively.\n\nUnlike one reviewer I thought Tom Ward perfectly acceptable as Wells, and completely convincing as an elderly man reminiscing about the past.",

They constantly meet at Noel Coward&apos;s publishing office in the hope of gaining favor for their next book and to make sure they are not left out on the latest gossip in the artistic realm.\n\nCora is a young idealist and poet who believes her love can change Noel Coward and that they can establish a long lasting relationship. She ends her relationship with her fiancé to become Noel&apos;s lover. However Noel returns to his playboy ways after 6 months and ends the relationship. This breaks Cora&apos;s heart and she eventually returns to her fiancé who has since lost his job and self respect after losing Cora.\n\nThe story picks up when Noel Coward leaves New York City by plane chasing after a new lover, a concert pianist who is just as shallow as he is. However a storm is encountered and the plane crashes into the sea killing Noel. God takes pity on him and grants him one month on Earth to find someone who will cry for him, otherwise he is condemned to wander the Earth, never to find rest, for all eternity.\n\nThe climax takes place on a dim, rainy night and ends with a prayer and a miracle. A strange redemption occurs. The death experience teaches Noel the true values of life, although his former associate artists are incapable of understanding his message.\n\nThe film has beautiful music and the scenes are classic film noir. Unfortunately it is not on DVD or VHS. For those who enjoy this type of movie it is a classic masterpiece. Noel Coward&apos;s dialog is sharp and witty and no one could play the part better.",

As in other parts of their empire, the Nazis embarked on a systematic campaign to ostracize Jews, and subsequently send them to concentration camps back in Germany. They tried to do this with Turkish Jews, but were prevented from doing so by the intervention of local Turkish diplomats, who put their own lives at risk by insisting that, as members of a neutral country, Turks had to be left alone. The diplomats worked hard to save members of the Franco-Turkish families, issuing passports and teaching them a few words of Turkish so that they could pass as Turks. Eventually they organized a series of rescue trains to transport the Turks out of France to the safety of Istanbul. Using first-hand testimony from those involved (both French and Turkish nationals) plus re-enacted scenes, Turkish PASSPORT tells a tale of heroism and endurance that leaves us feeling uplifted, in spite of the horrors of Nazi rule.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;After the sunset&quot; is surely not a demanding film...and none of us expected to be one. Take Pierce Brosnan - a great showman and a guy with asense of humor, add sexy as she&apos;s ever been Salma Hayek, add Woody Harrelson in good form, top it off with decent screenplay that does not take itself too seriously or risk falling into pretentious or shallow territory and you have yourself a very entertaining little piece of movie-making. There&apos;s not much to discuss about After the sunset. It has a lot of funny moments, at times it&apos;s silly and implausible but you don&apos;t really have time to think about that. It&apos;s without doubt not the best movie Pierce, Salma or Woody have made, but it&apos;s far from the worst either. If you&apos;re looking for an hour and a half of casual entertainment with solid performances, script and directing go see it...you&apos;ll feel pretty good after you do :)",

      "reviewBody": "Chris Lambert, you might think, is always good value for money. Or you might not think that at all. In fact, realistically, you&apos;re more likely to think that Natasha Henstridge (her out of Species) is always good value for money. Well, it doesn&apos;t matter in this case because you&apos;re wrong either way. Stop crying, you fool.\n\nThe first thing you&apos;ll notice about Adrenalin is that it all appears to have been filmed in a few scabby streets just behind the director&apos;s back garden. He probably thinks this looks authentic. It doesn&apos;t. It looks tragic. The entire film consists of Chris, &apos;Tash and a couple of other disposable rentacops legging it from one end of a street to the other and back again, popping into disintegrating buildings here and there along the way so that bits of it can fall on them, and occasionally pausing at either end of the street for a random shoot-out and/or for someone to get eaten by the startlingly unscary maniac they&apos;re supposed to be chasing. It must have taken such a great effort on behalf of all involved to keep the production values so consistently low that it somehow seems deserving of applause.\n\nMs. Henstridge, predictably, has very little to do except look scared, not manage to shoot anything and almost die every so often, while the inestimable Mr. Lambert seems to be here for no other reason than to get shot loads. It speaks volumes that he doesn&apos;t even attempt to rescue the film by interjecting his endearing trademark cackle into the dialogue at key moments. Not that he&apos;d get much chance anyway: nobody really says anything but &quot;Yowch, aargh, shoot him, he&apos;s eating me, aargh, oh no we&apos;re trapped, yowch, shoot him, aargh, my leg&apos;s fallen off.&quot;\n\nThe plot&apos;s some tosh about a plague having wiped out most of humanity, again, and towards the end of the film the wonderful scriptwriter comes up with the idea of having some Virus Control people turn up, mumble something about this killer they&apos;re chasing actually being the carrier of a new and far more deadly strain, then go away again and leave everyone to carry on getting shot. Everyone, that is, except for the people stuck with the job of writing up the box blurb, who seize this precious jewel of hope from the pigsty of horribleness and nurture it as if it were their own rancid offspring.\n\nAdrenalin, then. It&apos;s one of the most boring films I&apos;ve ever seen, which, for something that bills itself as a sci-fi horror thriller, isn&apos;t very good really."
