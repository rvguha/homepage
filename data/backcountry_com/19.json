        "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t normally write reviews, but was compelled to after a recent trip to Iceland. I purchased so many pairs of rain pants from so many different brands, which I tested in the shower before the trip, and ultimately decided on the BD Stormline Stretch and I&apos;m so glad I did. The beginning of the trip rained for 5 days straight, and on one of the longer hike days with heavy rain and out for the full day, I was completely dry and comfortable. They were so easy to put on, didn&apos;t have the crunchy swish swash of normal rain pants, they breathed really well, and were so lightweight, packable,and comfortable, I ended up living in these daily with thermals underneath for the entire trip. The pants also do super well for blocking the wind, which is also a constant in Iceland. I normally wear a size small, but went with the medium to have a higher waist and room for layers underneath, and had plenty of room to move my knees and legs while moving and hiking. One of the best purchases for keeping me dry, thank you Black Diamond. An absolute must for wet weather!!",

        "reviewBody": "Like other mesh baselayers (Brynje), it works fantastically for activities that mix high energy output with slower, colder moments.\nXC skiing, under a thin, very breathable wind-shell,  it never once felt wet. And that’s despite big variations in energy uitput between uphills and descents.\n\nSince it worked much better than my other baselayers, I wore it every day, yet the merino content and mesh construction kept it smelling civilized.\n\nFit is great. It is very stretchy and the sleeves are a decent length. It feels fine against the skin.",

        "reviewBody": "Before jumping into the review let me provide some background. I used this base layer on a sunny 40F day beneath my Alpha Ros Jacket. I typically run cooler so I prefer to add some extra layers to stay warm. During my ride I rode a decent mix between fast flats and steep climbs. \n\nNow, onto the review. The base layer kept me just warm enough when paired with the jacket. There were a few times where I felt some chills going down hill or while in a shaded canyon. However, what surprised me the most was how warm it kept me under the jacket.  Where my old base layer slowly collected sweat under my jacket and began to amplify the cold after a while, this base layer did an amazing job of providing enough warmth while allowing my sweat to evaporate off of my skin. This alone meant that while I started the ride on the colder side I was quickly able to warm up and stay warm, even after the climbs where I had been sweating. Instead of having to wait for my old base layer to dry out, this new one just stays dry. \n\nI was really skeptical of this base layer adding anything to my winter riding experience, but it has turned out to be a pretty amazing piece of kit, especially when you find yourself on a route with some serious sweat points. \n\nFor sizing, it runs typical Castelli. A Large fits perfectly @ 6&apos;1&quot; 175lbs.",

And been warned all keb models do loosen a little in the waist after alot of use so better it fits snuggly then too loose when new. And this model is long 34 inch leg length and as a person that is normal 32 inch leg, i got a local seamtress to hem it up as its a easy job to do since no zipper ventilation on the zip off legs. So can even make them shorter as well. But i do hope they will update leg length on more zip off pants in the future. Will buy a second pair for sure in the future.\nAs i live in all my Keb pants.",

        "reviewBody": "Request for Keb Gaiters Trousers in Regular 32” Length.\n\nThe Fjällräven Keb Gaiters Trousers are excellent and versatile just like all the other Keb Trousers. The only issue I have is that there are only offered in one length, and that length is Long at 34” and no where does it state the actual length. I have been requesting Fjällräven to offer the Keb Gaiters Trousers in a Regular 32” length and I’m sure there are guys and gals that would like to see them in a Short 30” length as well here in the States. I’m nowhere near a Fjällräven retail store for their tailor to make alterations, but the bottoms of the Keb Gaiters Trousers are so technical that an alteration will never be like factory and for $255 price tag it doesn’t make sense to butcher a brand new pair of adventure pants. Also the articulating knees may not lineup properly depending on your leg length. So hopefully Fjällräven will finally offer Regular and Short lengths soon. \n\nThere is no outer knee pocket to put kneepads in the trousers which is fine, but I would like to see lower leg ventilation added. The zip-off gaiter portion is in-genius and can come in handy if necessary, very smart design. I would like to see all the Keb Trousers carabiner belt loops have 1 cm of added length to make it less fiddly to get a carabiner in the very small loops.",

The stretch material provides flexibility in all the right places,   have plenty of room in the pockets for storage, allow you to regulate temperature with the added zippers, and the gaiter hooks are always helpful in keeping debris out of my boots.

        "reviewBody": "I own the F80808R (Regular, i.e., shorter) version in Dark Navy - Uncle Blue color. The pants have an excellent fit; they do not limit my freedom of movement and comfortable to wear all day. Also, they look good on me. The utility features, e.g., pockets are great.\n\nThe waxing does not make the pants as water repellent as I expected, but when wet they dry really quickly. The pants are warm enough for me to hit 0 degrees (Celsius), below that I need a thin base layer. If the weather gets warmer (20C) the air gets easily trapped and the pants feel really warm. But the vents help. When zipped off and with vents open, the shorts feel okay even in 30-35C.\n\nWaxing the pants I find more annoying than I expected. Because of the high price and bad breathability I would give 4 stars so far, but there is something that really kicks me off balance. That is: the fabric fades super quickly during sunny days.\n\nHow fast? I bought the trousers brand new. I spent 1-week in them in a summer camp/festival as shorts (very sunny), then I used them in the city for 1 month during the summer (mostly indoors, but again as shorts). I washed them 3 times (zipped-on). In the end, the upper part really changed color (disturbingly visible) compared to the lower part and that broke my heart and excitement towards these pants. I would not buy it again. In the forest, I don&apos;t care, but I planned to wear these in the city, too. That might have been just my bad expectations.",

If one is looking for a shell pant that may also serve as shorts or provide ventilation, and have a pair of gaiters as a bonus, then look no further. They are well constructed and the materials are tough where needed yet forgiving for comfort and flexibility. For size reference, 6’1”, 175 lbs, and 32” waist and 32” inseam. The Regular size in this trouser fits well if the gaiter is not fastened on a hiking boot, the Long allows for more bend in the knee when fastened on the boot.",

Got a flat, valve cores on both spare tubes failed and I went from a cyclist to a pedestrian just like that. Lesson learned... I added a valve core tool (and extra cores) to my repair kit and switched my road pump to a Silca Tattico BT version because it doesn&apos;t have a thread-on chuck that will loosen the cores.\n\nI periodically check/tighten valve cores and haven&apos;t had an issue since.

(Many people have the same complaint about this model boot. ) Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t keep the receipt and couldn&apos;t remember where I bought them. Keen said no receipt, no warranty which I understand. They told me to get them repaired. I did. The repairs are failing in the same places. There&apos;s something about this boot design that makes them fall apart. They&apos;re comfortable, but falling apart. \n\nI switched to the Lowa Renegade. Much better quality.",

After struggling in and out of a chest zip wetsuit for too many years I was excited to find a classic back zip that is warm and has all the goodies a proper suit should have.

I have purchased two pair hiking shoes and boots for myself and a pair of work boots for my son. We demand the highest quality footwear available against the elements. . and have maintained ownership of the highest quality boots for the last two decades. \nI am very pleasantly surprised by the workmanship, materials and construction of this brand. Exceptional comfort and functionality in a good looking respectable shoe. So glad my sister in law shared these shoes with me.

Ultimately I could never get it right?I changed the angle of the seat, the distance to my handlebars, everything. Yet it never seemed to jive with my sit bones. I ordered a S/M saddle, which is what all the fit profiles suggested for me, but maybe I needed the M/L. I don?t know. I ended up having to return this one and going with the Luna by Fizik, and I?m way happier.",

I can tell you how frustrating it is to stop cycling after 15-20 miles  just because your lady bit is crying and you can no longer sit on your saddle...Not anymore with this new saddle. \n\nPros:\n1 No more chafing: Ergon has a wider butt seat and a narrower nose with a relief channel. So, my labia-specific problem is gone with this awesome saddle shape. No more back pain either.\n2 I got the red saddle. Bright, deep red. I love the color. great quality. sleek design, sleek logo unlike some other bike companies.\n3 Comes with matching bar tape. Great quality!\n4. Long rides without break-in period. Did a 30mi 2 days ago. Did another 20mi today. That wouldn&apos;t normally fly with my old Prologo seat but now i can go all day on my bike without thinking about the pain in the v. \n5. Light weigiht!!! Having compared multiple saddle weights, this is the lightest i can find sub $100.\nIf you&apos;re still unsure:\n\nI am planning on doing a 300mi bike-packing trip. Before, i wasn&apos;t sure about my ability to do such a long trip without permanently damaging my lady bit or giving up from the sheer pain. I am now fully confident that i can do it. I finally feel like I can perform to my fullest ability. If you&apos;re having similar problems as me, please consider purchasing it. I wish i had looked into this wayyyy earlier to save my past self from all those painful rides!",

I’m new to camping and this was super easy to inflate and set up. I love that I didn’t need a pump. Just set it up and let it self inflate. I did that first thing and by the time I’m ready for bed later it’s all good to go. I love how comfortable it is and doesn’t deflate at all over night. I went camping again in Mount Laguna, CA in July for the second test run with this mattress. Slept really good again and the set up was easy. I also love the bag it comes with to store it in and travel with. Protects it very well and easy to roll up. Camped again shortly after in Big Bear, CA. Seriously can’t imagine not having this mattress now. It’s worth every penny! I would buy it again and highly recommend.",

        "reviewBody": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchased two of these in the early summer to prepare for a two week long camping trip with my wife and daughter. First used in dinosaur national monument along the green river. Was around 103 degrees during the day 85 at night. Easy to set and durable. Extremely comfortable, didn’t sweat at night everyone slept great! Then moved up to Gros venture along the Tetons. Temp during the day was around 83 night lows were in the mid 40s. We used fleece thermal liners paired with the tanami down blankets. The sleeping mats helped us stay warm paired with other excellent products we got from sea to summit. Everyone loves them and we will be returning customers to see what else sea to summit comes up with in the future.",

        "reviewBody": "This is truly the most comfortable sleep you&apos;ll get outside. Absolutely recommend. In fact, I tell people about it because so many people say they don&apos;t camp because they can&apos;t &apos;sleep on the ground&apos;. This pad is a game changer for that. The pad self inflates for the most part.. I end up putting a few breaths of air in to get to my preferred firmness. It is ridiculously comfortable. I camp primarily in Florida, so I can&apos;t comment on R value or warmth. I also camp from my car, so lugging it around isn&apos;t a big deal.. but it is bigger than both my tent and sleeping bag. But again.. not a problem in you have the space.. well worth it! \nI am 5&apos; 5 1/2&quot; and I got the regular, if I were much taller I&apos;d recommend the longer version. Just for comfort.. if you have the space in your car.. why not? I also want to get the double.. because I had to inflate the ole air mattress this weekend after becoming adjusted to the insane comfort of the Sea to Summit pad.. and dang.. the air mattress is only half as comfortable as the Sea to Summit! And I used to like the air mattress. I&apos;m completely spoiled with my camping sleep setup thanks to Sea to Summit",

It’s not the lightest thing however if you’re just casually camping like I am and not backpacking around I highly recommend. Another downside is that it doesn’t fit in my current duffel which kind of sucks but it’s not that bad to carry around. That’s on me for not measuring beforehand lol. It’s also nice if you are looking for something similar to an air mattress, my roommates friend borrowed it when she stayed over for a few days and loved it.",

The covers fit snugly. which is fine, but if I wore any larger of a size (even a half size), I think they would be too tight. \n\nI initially thought these were too small until I figured out how to put them on properly: first, slide the shoe cover on, above your ankle. Then put on the shoe. Then slide the cover down, and pull over the toe area of the shoe first, then the back, and lastly fasten the velcro strap on the bottom. Do not try and pull the cover over the shoe and cleat, when putting on or taking off.\n\nMy feet tend to get cold easily, and I can ride in temperatures in the lower 40&apos;s (Fahrenheit) comfortably with these. I recently did a road ride in the mid to upper 30&apos;s and stuck toe warmer packs to my socks, and I was fine. I do not think I could ride at freezing or below with these. \n\nKeep in mind they are not going to be as warm as more expensive, dedicated winter shoes (by Lake, 45 NRTH, etc.). These covers do not provide any insulation for the bottom of the shoes. \n\nI bought the hi-viz yellow ones, and they really stand out, but I do wish they were yellow on all sides, instead of having the black stripe on the rear. I think it is important to be highly visible to motorists approaching from the rear.",

Undoing the velcro strap underneath the arch makes it easy to get them on and off.\n\nAlso checked out Gore&apos;s latest shoe covers, made from new fleece-lined stretch Infineum WindStopper.  The Intensos have more substantial material around the edges of the soles. On my set of the previous version of the Gores,  I wore a hole under the front of the left one from putting my left foot down at stops, and the new Gores do not seem sturdier in that area.\n\nThe Intensos also accommodate cleats better: the new Gores have a tightly sized hole which unfortunately does not line up well with my cleats, which I have moved back on my shoes.\n\nDownside of the Intensos is that the rear part is black (I got the bright yellow ones for visibility), hard for traffic behind to see.  So I clip USB-rechargeable flashing red LED&apos;s (EverLight FX by Apace, $25/pair on Amazon) to the tops of the backs of the Intensos.",

Paired with a toe warmer on top of my shoe, my feet tolerated the weather in both types of conditions. For cold, the potential drawback is there is not bottom sole (so that it can accommodate MTB/Gravel shoes) so the bottom of your feet may get cold. For wet, even though it&apos;s a pretty tight fit at the top, I think water still finds a way in when there is a consistent wet road spray. Finally, I had to size up. Started with a M for my size 41.5 road shoes/42 MTB shoes. The road shoes barely fit but I couldn&apos;t get my MTB shoes on. With a size L it&apos;s still tight but I can get them on.\n\nIn the end, I think it&apos;s a good value for what you get. For longer rides in inclement weather, I would recommend want something extra to help these, like fenders or a toe warmer.",

Makes it very breathable but can also hold gear. \r\nOnly issue is that the mesh has torn slightly along the edges where it’s down to the vest.

I don&apos;t care about colors but love that it&apos;s easy to spot if you get a non neutral color.",

It is not perfect, the red plastic ring around the lid handle plastic broke years ago but the lid lift handle itself remains. The bottom of the main pot bumped up a bit but that is acceptable since it is a lightweight design. Everything else are going great. The Talon handle is perfectly rigid and foldable. I recently bought a MSR water kettle and it fits perfectly inside the cook set with the insulated cups removed. I highly recommend this product and would be very happy if I can get a piece of the broken red plastic ring replaced.",

I have never have found use for the bowls that are included in the kit. I prefer to take a separate bowl with a lid that I can re-hydrate dried food in or put the lid on to keep food warm while I prepare the rest of the meal. The mugs are useful and nest well. The major improvement that could be made to this kit would be to provide a handle and lid that will pack well with just the small pot. This addition would make this a great kit, with the flexibility to be used as a solo kit. It disappoints me that MSR has chosen instead only offer a separate kit for solo hiking.",

We eat and cook out of the little pot, and use the big pot only on long trips where one might want to have a &quot;&quot;bath&quot;&quot;, we are boiling instead of filtering, or if the river is doing the carrying. I love the mugs, they keep coffee hot, almost undrinkable for the first 20 minutes from boil, the lids don&apos;t seal as well as they used to, but these things have hundreds of miles being crammed in a pack. The little pot is about as non stick as you could make it, even after all this use. It&apos;s heavy all together, you gram counters can fuss all you like, my 100 lbs 37 year old wife carries this set and likes it over everything else so far and that includes my titanium pot set, from another company that she feels is not &quot;&quot;up to it&quot;&quot; if I remember her words correctly, she hasn&apos;t carried it even once always going back to her old banged up MSR set.",

I live in Victoria bc, the winters aren’t that cold either. I’m 5’10” 185 and the medium fits good if you don’t want baggy clothes like me.",

        "reviewBody": "I was drawn to Fjallraven for their nature-driven, outdoorsy ethos. So when I was on the search for an insulated jacket, I chose the Keb Padded Hoodie. So far, it has served as a smart and stylish outer layer jacket. I sized it down for a slimmer fit and it feels amazing! It has adequate room to allow for maximum movement and for base layers and a lightweight fleece, And the slimmer fit will easily fit under a shell. It is windproof, and water-resistant - it is important to note that it is not intended for long exposure to rain - rain will bead off, but any longer than a minute, and water will penetrate the outer fabric. As a synthetic insulated jacket, it is lightweight, warm, and cozy, without the puffy look. The interior fabric is amazingly soft, and the hood, when down and zipped to the chin, feels sooo good around the neck! The double front zipper is a smart feature, and once you develop muscle memory on how to engage it, it is not an issue. Jackets of similar weight and aesthetic are Kuhl&apos;s Aktivtor, Arcteryx Atom LT, and KUIU&apos;s Kenai. Loving my Keb, and I hope to get years of performance from this smart and stylish jacket.",

        "reviewBody": "Wanting an insulated, synthetic jacket, I considered a few name brand companies and decided to give Fjallraven a chance for their ethos. I considered fit, functionality, and style. Fit: a close to the body, slim look. Function: 3-season, in town/on trail versatility, lightweight, durable, cozy and warm. Style: not your trendy puffer silhouette. Between the Expedition Latt Hoodie and the Keb Padded Hoodie, I chose the Keb, in black and size XS. A few notes for potential customers: The Keb is cut larger than the Latt (the Keb in XS fits similarly to the Latt in S). The black is matte, and really a deep charcoal, which I like. The Latt has a puffier loft than the Keb, but as far as I could tell when I tried both, they are equally warm. The Keb is buttery soft inside and out, so it feels really cozy and luxurious, and though it is supposed to be durable, I will not wear it carrying firewood or trudging around in underbrush. The hood when not in use sits easily around the neck (unlike the Latt, which is stiffer). The double zipper is a smart feature, but you&apos;ll need to develop muscle memory to zip it smoothly. In the slimmer size, it still is roomy enough for a base layer and fleece mid-layer, and not so puffy to wear under an outer shell - so fit (for me) is perfect! So far, so good. Not the most expensive jacket in its class, but it is an investment, and I hope to get plenty of use out of it!",

        "reviewBody": "When I honed in on Fjallraven for an insulated jacket, I narrowed the search between the Expedition Latt Hoodie and the Keb Padded Hoodie. I considered several factors: fit, function, and style. First, the fit: I wanted the jacket to be more fitted around the torso and arms, yet have room for a midlayer as needed. Second, the functionality - warm, breathable, durable, and versatile. And third, the style: great in town and on trail, looking extremely capable in both environments, not looking like your typical, trendy puffer.\n\nAfter purchasing the Latt and the Keb in S and XS, I settled on the Keb XS as it checked off most of what I wanted. The Keb is not as thick and puffy as the Latt, but the two jackets were equally warm and cozy at 55 degrees F with a shirt underneath. The Keb in XS is closer to the Latt in S around the torso, and the sleeves are narrower - which I prefer. The Keb is a softer material than the Latt, and the hood sits and feels better around the neck when not in use. The Latt&apos;s hood, however, feels warmer. \n\nBackcountry&apos;s customer service was great, not only in offering advice between the 2 jackets, but they made returning the items easy and pleasant.\n\nI hope to make use of this jacket for may years to come!",

        "reviewBody": "Sigh.... so here is the run down. I bought this jacket without knowing the cost, offerings, or really anything else about other insulated jackets. This is a good jacket, but as I’ve look around about a year after buying this jacket (I was shopping for a down jacket for lighter warmth, not a replacement to this jacket) I realized that other more performance oriented brands offer more practical jackets for the same, or less amounts of money. With that being said, I still love this jacket and here are my thoughts: \n1) it’s built right. I have used this jacket through two seasons and it looks fells and preforms like it’s brand new. I see myself using it many years down the line. Durability is definitely good\n2) I am very annoyed by the omission of zippered hand warmer pockets. Stuff has fallen out of them more than once. The zipper chest pocket helps make up for this a bit but still left something to be desired. \n3) this jackets warmth perfect hits what I would call middle weight. Nice as a mid-layer in the winter (when down isn’t practical) and a stand alone in both fall and spring. \n4) the looks are next level. This jacket nails style and then some. Have gotten countless comments\n5) hood is cozy and adjustable\n6) I haven’t used it for much aerobic activities so I can’t comment on how it breaths for that. For day to day use I would rate it at a solid -a.\nMy conclusion: if you want some urban mid-weight warmth that looks amazing, can also hold its own doing light activities (hiking, walking, maybe some more prolonged trekking), will last a long time if treated right, and don’t care about all out technical performance then this might be for you.",

I found it here at Back Country and couldn?t be happier. Delivery was super fast and the price was actually cheaper than what I was going to pay. Definitely a customer for life. So far as the shoe I am beyond pleased with it. Very comfortable and secure. Super easy to adjust during longer rides. I was warned by a few people to never get a white shoe for cycling but as someone who ALWAYS rocks white kicks I did it anyway. This shoe is super easy to clean not that I find it very dirty if at all in the first place.",

Good addition to my &quot;wicking&quot; wardrobe which includes smartwool merino, etc. Very functional, but not very stylish. \n\nBought size S. I&apos;m 125lb, 5&apos;3&quot;, 32B waist 27, hip 37. This is a relaxed fit for me, definitely not oversized but NOT fitted at all - perfect. I would consider buying this in another color in a larger size for an oversized look. \n\nCan&apos;t speak to the wicking, breathability, and odor retention yet. Will assess on my next camping trip.",

It was also flattering and cute enough to wear by itself with leggings after the day’s activities. I ended up wearing it 4 days in a row and am definitely going to purchase more colors for easy fall/winter layers. I am usually between a small and medium, I purchased a medium and this fit slightly oversized.",

I went with my usual size liking the slightly oversized fit on the model but it&apos;s HUGE. I did reference the size chart. I will prob keep it as it ticks all my boxes and will match with most things. But I&apos;m not sure it will keep me super warm with how large it is. I plan on wearing a tank underneath. Definitely a great option if you aren&apos;t wanting to fork over the big bucks. The Golden brown color is just as pictured.",

All future shock 1.5 and 2.0s have a smaller diameter than traditional steerer tubes to account for the future shock.

I got these as a warranty replacement for a pair of the Yuba style that cracked below the lens. And while the metal around the lens solved that problem, the ear piece on this one broke right above the hinge just shy of a year. I do live in a very sunny place and wear my shades daily, maybe they are just not cut out for daily use.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the warranty, but not sure it&apos;s worth it if you have to go through it once a year or less.",

I thought it would do for most moderate temperature days here in Seattle. But I did get cold in it already over a cashmere sweater. I realize water resistant is not waterproof, but I was out the other day hunched over harvesting some mushrooms before they got too wet, and it started pouring, and it went through the coat, then my sweater and cami as well. I’ve been stuck in rain before, but never got wet through any water resistant only coat. Fortunately it dried alright and wasn’t ruined. Though this would be my main daily coat. Avoiding buying a heavier waterproof coat because I have enough coats already, and doesn’t usually get very cold here to need that much warmth. \r\nAlso I normally wear an XS  it needed the S in this.",

        "reviewBody": "We&apos;ve had one now for 4 years and we use it on vacation when we fly with our bikes and rent a car.  Our bikes go in their cases, this gets tossed into the duffel with our other bike paraphernalia and is ready to go when we arrive at our destination.  Then, with a rental car, we can go to any place we want in the vicinity and start our ride.  \n\nThe picture shown shows quick release only but there are adaptors straight from SeaSucker that remove the QR and replace it so that 12mm or 15mm thru axles can be used (works very well).  There is also an attachment that puts a steel rubber coated locking loop in the tailgate hinge or the trunk hinge to which you can attach a locking cable.  The other alternative is to remove the rack at the trailhead.  Either is easy and it&apos;s your choice - we&apos;ve done both. \n\nThat said, we&apos;ve driven a few hundred miles with the bikes on top with this, we have gone at any of the max highway speeds, and it works just fine.  While it wouldn&apos;t necessarily be my choice for a rack for cross country travel, if you need a rack that is easy on/easy off and travels well, this is it.  For that, it&apos;s a brilliant design.  It works on any rental car.\n\nThe suction cups are massive.  Any individual one would be more than strong enough to keep the rack on the car and this one has 4.  I&apos;ve never had one even loosen up over time.  They&apos;re easy to check because there&apos;s an indicator on each pump that shows you if it&apos;s losing pressure so you can tell with a simple visual inspection.  So no qualms about using this with $14,000 worth of bikes on top.  Use a little  water from your water bottle to clean the roof top under the suction cup and to provide a little extra suction, a few pumps on the suction cup&apos;s internal pump, and this thing is really stuck to your car.  Off you go at 70mph down the highway.",

Instead, I hauled around my 38 lb beach cruiser and hoped for the best.  The rack held fast, every time. It has four suction cups, each independently secured, so even if one were to lose suction, you&apos;d still have plenty of hold. The only downside, once you get past the trust issue, is securing your bikes during stops along the road. There&apos;s really no way to do so. Perhaps a cable lock through the windows? In any case, be prepared to keep an eye on your bike when you stop.",

        "reviewBody": "Recently got a new car and didn&apos;t want to mount a hitch this time by drilling holes in, and mounting to, the trunk. Thule and Yakima both recommend NOT installing a roof rack on this car. The SeaSucker rack wasn&apos;t even on my radar.\n\nSO glad I gave it a chance! Initially I was super sketched out, but this thing is legit. I can grab onto it and rock my car back/forth, there is absolutely no budge. I have left it on the car all day and none of the cups ever lose enough suction to compromise the grab, although I&apos;m still freaked out enough that I regularly check it.\n\nIt does require more time/effort than a fixed rack, but it only takes about a minute to install and about another minute to uninstall. No damage to paint, no permanent marks (obviously should have a clean surface when installing).\n\nI wouldn&apos;t hesitate for a second to recommend this rack. After actually using it, I am a believer. Usually only carry one bike, whether road bike or mtn bike, but occasionally I do carry two. Time, distance, speed...no problems.",

However, I must mention that the seam sealing at the bottom of the shorts can occasionally cause irritation on dry skin. Besides that, they are fantastic running shorts with a comfortable liner and waistband, has great airflow, and is constructed with excellent materials.",

        "reviewBody": "This is a terrific ski shell.  With 30 years of skiing under my belt, this is the real deal for a resort skier who owns enough layers to want a shell. If you like to hike to the side country, ski aggressively and think about, or dabble in backcountry skiing, but aren’t ready to commit to a shell for that purpose this is your jacket.  I own a Norrona Trollveggen Pro Light jacket for backcountry and mountaineering.  This is basically the front side and side equivalent.  It’s beautifully crafted, with the construction being every bit as premium as Arcteryx, Patagonia, and Norrona.  The shell is roomy, without being overly baggy.  The powder skirt is attached, there are two internal pockets, one mesh and the other taffeta so you can put wet things and other things that need to dry in the pockets.  Very convenient.  The two chest pockets are well situated and easy to use with gloves on. The right chest pocket has a goggle wipe attached in it.  It’s a timeless and stylish design.  Simple.  Elegant.  Polished yet unpretentious.  \nZippered arm pocket for the card. Durable face fabric for years of use. Long cut in the back provides comfort and protection. \nThe hand pockets are fleece lined for a soft touch and the overall impression is fantastic.  I haven’t used it yet, (it’s August)  but have put all my gear on, goggles, helmet, gloves, pants, mid layers and pants, etc and I can tell you this is a great shell. It’s every bit as good as the top brands (I have those too) that get reviewed in the“Best Ski Jackets” searches. \nSo what’s the knock against it? \nThe Hood:  I have a thing for hoods.  Basically, when the wind is ripping, the snow is blowing and there is nowhere to hide you have to hide in your hood.  This is true on a chairlift or an exposed ridge. The hood design is a B.  It’s made to fit over a ski helmet and does this very well. It provides good coverage for the chin and cheeks.  It’s doesn’t turn like the Arcteryx and Norrona hoods which I consider the best, but it isn’t far behind and fits a helmet well.  It can cinch down to accommodate a non-helmet fit too and be comfortable and functional.  It’s fine and it works.  It just isn’t Arcteryx or Norrona hood level.  However, if you are using it for front and side skiing with a helmet I’d encourage you to find this a hidden gem and realize that a B hood on an A shell for a great price is better than an A hood on an A shell for a premium. \nIf your life depends on the hood then consider the importance of the hood.  If you can’t recall the last five times you were thankful you had a hood at all then this is for you. You’ll be thankful you have this hood when you need it.\nThe pit zips are one way and covered in mesh and adequate for resort and side country skiing. Easy to use with gloves on.  Again, not a dedicated backcountry shell.  Works well for front and side skiing. \nThe next curiosity about this shell is that it has a mesh back and a soft and luxurious taffeta lining in the front and the sleeves.  However, it feels like a cross between 2 and 3 layer gore tex.  It’s a little stiffer than 2 layer Gore Tex, but it is softer than 3 layer Gore Tex and more comfortable to wear.  Overall, it’s smooth and comfortable to wear and layers terrifically.  \nUltimately it’s the best of both worlds between 2 and 3 layer without being overly one or the other.  I bring this up because it’s kind of a different experience when you first try it on.  Feels more like 2 layer, but protects more like 3 layer.  Maybe it will soften with use. \nThe cuffs accommodate either an over or under glove and mitt.  \nOverall, this is an undiscovered gem in the shell world.  If you need a ski shell, want to layer, and are primarily a resort skier who enjoys other ski adventures, give this a long look.",

The fit is a little narower than other Altras and the length feels a little longer. I tried half sizing down but they were too narrow/tight. The bad: The materials for this shoe are not durable. I started getting a hole in the left shoe before 30 days and now a hole in the right shoe shortly after 30 days. The hole is where your toes bend in the shoes. I cannot recommend this shoe given the cost how quickly they deteriorate",

Please, please start listening to the people that were loyal to your brand and it&apos;s not just me, I know a lot of people that have changed to Topo but like many of those that have tried the arch support of Topo kills me. I&apos;ve tried many iterations and models of Altra and the Escalantes and the Torins have fit best altough not sure about the Escalante 4 since I bought mulitiple of the 3 since I liked them and the reviews of the 4 are not as strong as the 3. Have other COMPLETELY separate models if you are trying to get more market share for the masses, but I&apos;m running (didn&apos;t know that pun was going to happen) out of options and I so far haven&apos;t found another brand that fits better. Hoping you can get back to your roots with the fit that got you a following in the first place. Cheers, Richard",

Loved the way the Torin 6 and 5 had a soft heel counter. Hopefully on the 8 they can fix this.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been testing these out with 5K tempo runs. The fit is familiar as I started in Altras with the Escalante Racer (6/5 would recommend). Despite fitting well I found other Escalante models (2.5 &amp; 3) to feel like running with planks on my feet. The Torins show very little of that problem so far. The midsole feels responsive but not cushy or bouncy. The energy return seems fairly low. Generally I don&apos;t mind these things but I am having doubts about making them my marathon shoe. I wish there was a standard footshape version of the Vanish series. Make it so! I&apos;ve worn the Provision 7 and found them to less responsive but to feel a little more cushy compared to the Torin 7. The fit of the Provision was slightly tighter in the toebox and overall not quite right. Enough to be uncomfortable over a longer run (10K+ for me). So far the upper is fine. Heel hold is good. Midfoot feels secure but not constricted. I have not had them long enough to note much else other than they are all PLAIN. I hope you are hearing this a lot. Altra, you need better color options. Think brighter, go nuts, give me more COLORS. I&apos;m tired of black, white, grey, black &amp; white, and maybe green. You actually did that with the Escalante 4!!! (Which I&apos;m looking forward to). End rant. Torin 7: 4/5. Could be a 5/5 with some of that Ego Pro midsole. Make it so! -Tode",

They&apos;re warm but not so much so that I&apos;ll be sweating when it&apos;s close to or just below zero and they&apos;re waterproof which is great when walking through slush. I think if you were to try to use them for summer hiking your feet would be unbearably sweaty but I have not tried.  Toe box is very roomy. I&apos;m a big fan of Altras and their wide toe box and these come close to that level of roominess.  Highly recommended!",

        "reviewBody": "I like the way these boots fit comfortably from day one. I bought my first pair in 2017 and took them on day hikes on trails in the hills. They were supportive, thanks to the mid-height, and had no break-in period. Since then I have purchased several more pairs and wear them every day. I usually keep a brown pair and a black pair and alternate them. I usually walk on pavement, about a mile or two per day, and a pair worn every other day lasts me about eighteen months before the bottom starts to show that it has worn through the black part. I ordered my seventh pair from BackCountry just before Christmas and expect it to arrive today. I recommend them to friends. They are also good for my plantar fasciitis -- I replace the original insoles with SuperFeet.",

        "reviewBody": "I love pretty much everything about these boots. Other hiking boots I&apos;ve tried in this price range include Salomon X-Ultra 4 Mid GTX, X-Ultra 3 Mid GTX, various Merrell hiking boots and shoes, and The North Face waterproof hiking boots. The Oboz Bridger Mid B-Dry blow them ALL out of the water in terms of quality of materials, worksmanship, and especially durability. These boots have served me well for about a year now and could easily last another couple of years. I am a landscaper by trade and wear these to work five days a week, and often for walks/hikes on the weekend. They&apos;ve held up extremely well to my heavy usage. I&apos;m telling you, both pairs of Salomon boots I owned fell apart faster than I&apos;d expect a pair of Wal Mart boots to do the same. These Oboz boots are different. More comprehensive review below...\n\nThe Oboz Bridger Mid B-Dry are made from quality materials, including leather with high-durability rubber in key places. They are plenty comfortable while also being HIGHLY supportive. Immediately upon trying them I could tell they were a lot sturdier and more supportive than all of the others I&apos;d tried up to that point. The insole felt high-quality by comparison. These boots are TRULY waterproof (within reason) while still being breathable enough for hot summer days in the high desert. The rubber wrapped around the toe area and heel area of the boots seems to have done a ton to make these boots last longer. The sole of the boot might look strange at first glance, but I&apos;ve found it a great and versatile sole shape. I&apos;ve worn these on all terrains in all weather while doing landscaping work. I&apos;ve worn these on hot days, in torrential downpours, and also all throughout cold winters with heavy snowfall and ice. Somehow they manage to be breathable enough in summer and warm enough in winter with proper socks, and are still effectively waterproof. In summary, if you are looking for possibly the best combination of quality, comfort, support, and durability in a hiking boot under $200: these are very likely the best value waterproof hiking boot out there. Working as a landscaper is one of the best stress tests for a boot, and this one excelled. IMPORTANT NOTE: these absolutely run one-half size small. I&apos;m normally a size 11, I ordered these in a size 11.5 and it is perfect.",

And Oboz Bridgers have held up better than any other hiking boots I&apos;ve owned. Durability-wise, my last pair lasted more than 1200 miles. Traction-wise, I often pass hikers half my age on steep descents due to this boot&apos;s aggressive outsoles and deep heel brake, which dig into loose surfaces really well (scree, gravel, mud, etc). Comfort-wise, Oboz features upmarket insoles, solid foot support, and plenty of cushion, which works well for my messed up feet and ankles. We all have different feet and prefer different kinds of hiking. But the Bridger is my go-to boot for moderate to difficult hikes that require solid foot and ankle support.",

        "reviewBody": "I was pressing my whole body weight on it (130 lbs) and it&apos;s very difficult to compress the aluminum cross bars. This makes it near impossible to assemble and disassemble the cot. The Helinox Cot One is heavier but has much better aluminum cross bars where there&apos;s a lever to release and also lock it in place (if you look up an assembly video for the Helinox Cot One you&apos;ll see what I mean). \n\nOnce I&apos;ve finally assembled it, you kind of feel like you&apos;re sinking a bit (my shoulders feel like they&apos;re rolling forward) and I&apos;m only 130 lbs. I&apos;m surprised given how much tension there is created by how stiff the aluminum cross bars are. It&apos;s light for a cot, but not nearly as light as the Thermarest inflatable pads (e.g. Neoair XLite or XTherm). So I feel like it&apos;s the worst of both worlds. It&apos;s not as light as the inflatable pads, but because it&apos;s meant to be &quot;ultralight&quot;, the lever locking mechanism is removed making it very difficult to assemble. It&apos;s better to either go with an inflatable pad if weight is what you care about or if you really want a cot, get a slightly heavier one with better aluminum cross bar mechanism. \n\nThis is just a me problem, but I also assumed it would be breathable from the photo. It looked like the fabric was a mesh, but it turns out it&apos;s just a solid piece of fabric with a grid pattern. The fabric is not very breathable.",

Not only is it light weight but the bulk of cot and light weight mattress was a lot less then the bulk of foam pads packed in on mules. My sleep was amazing on this cot! Will be buying one for my wife as well. This is the best outdoor product I have bought in years! \nIf I could make one recommendation is that the cot would come in a couple of inches wider.",

A belt is needed for comfort as they are just barely not too big on my waist, but most Large gear has been tight and not given me room to move. Baggy without snowboard boots on, so I just cuff them once with regular shoes while not riding. Great pants, durable and stylish!",

After reading the reviews on these, I was surprised to see people saying that I should order a small. I haven’t worn a size small in anything in years. Sure enough, I got a small and they mostly fit. They fit in the waste but were a bit snug in the thighs. It felt like I could rip them if I squat down too deep. The length and lower legs were great. The fit made me believe that a medium would assuredly be too big. \n\nThe pants are great. The sizing is just weird.",

I tried it as a second layer under a ski shell the other day and it’s great, but it is a fairly rigid piece of clothing, and I prefer to use it as outerwear on a cold day with a pair of jeans.  It’s extremely tough you could do yardwork in it or a lot of times when I’m going to and from the mountain, it is my go to gear stepping in and out of my truck loading and unloading my gear    It is highly wind resistant and breathe this really nice with Breathable patches under your arms\r\n\r\nThe fit is interesting. I normally wear a medium at 55 and 162 pounds. But this piece of clothing has large shoulders. Thus I move down to a small and it fits great.     I’ll try it again under my Arc’teryx shell but again I like it as an outer where peace.  I could see skiing in this on a warmer day with just a vest as well  \r\n\r\nLooks wise it looks great",

This helmet is light and good fit but I recommend that one should measure their head circumference and then choose size. My size for any helmets brands; bike or motorcycle has always been Large so I bought large but it is little bigger to my head for which I have to fully tighten the adjustment dial to not let the helmet move. Next purchase I will make sure to buy M size. Other than that the helmet is good and the grey suits. My daughter loves it and has a grey copy of her own.

Based on other reviews saying it was too small I went with the larger size option and it fit well. I had previously owned the black diamond half dome helmet and that helmet would always shift around on my head, this helmet has a much better suspension system, material construction, and tightening system that keep the helmet comfortably secure all day without any shifting around as you look up and down while on route. It takes impacts well as tested when a large dinner plate of ice fell on my head while on a AI3 route. \n\nThe only things that could be better about this helmet are: \n\n1. weight - it&apos;s on the heavy side, you can definitely feel it, but at this price it&apos;s acceptable. I also was looking for a hard shell helmet for alpine and multipitch trad that can reliably take abuse for years and this helmet will certainly meet that.\n2. color - can we please get something more neutral? gray -good, orange ... not my first choice.  But in the gear industry it&apos;s all about flash and flair i guess...",

I had to size up to large from a medium, but I tend to fall on the cusp of both sizes (so not irregular/unexpected). My only area of constructive criticism is in regards to the shoulder strap/velcro system - than range of adjustment is limited, and the bibs could have benefited from having a little more velcro to go smaller or larger.  Other than that, I am pretty happy.",

Fabric is great, the rest of the fit is fantastic for skiing and movement.  I&apos;m 5&apos;8&quot;and about 185lbs these days.  Big hips, and they fit great in the lage. I have a feeling these bibs were designed for ice climbing more than skiing which is probably why the cuff is a little tight.  Over In very happy.  Great pocket layout as well.",

        "reviewBody": "Great pants for winter hiking if you want bibs. Nice material that looks and feels very durable. However, I bought them for skiing and the lower pant is too narrow to go over my ski boots well, a little too tight. My friend bought them and he has heated insoles in his boots so a little battery back on the outside of the bott at the top. He has to leave the lower section unzipped to get the pants to come down over the boot. \nAnd I am 6’1”, 190 lbs so I bought the large regular length.  Fit great but suspenders are too long and won’t adjust short enough for me. Also, not found of velcro adjustments on suspenders. Those little metal slides work much better and don’t weigh much.\nLots of pockets that are great and handy!",

New G-tex pro is well constructed to their highest standards, Awesome full side zips on both legs with drop seat capabilities when nature calls. Several shells on market only have thigh vents,but when its warm full zips are the way. Internal boot gaitor is a must also. Only complaint would be make articulated knee areas for high stepping and poss a bit wider thigh area for same reason. Also poss a thin waist band belt to snug up that area, for when not wearing pack or harness. Uses for ski touring and ice climbing. Pockets do not interfear with harness.

However, I have only used them in 3 fishing days and the striping guard part of the glove is already worn out and the material has a hole in it in that portion of the glove. I thought it would’ve lasted longer. The grip the glove provides works well on a rod that has a synthetic golf grip handle but feels insecure on a cork handle unless there is moisture on the glove. I thought I may have the rod fly out of my hand the first time I tried it with a rod that has a cork handle. That said, I do like how the glove fits my hand but I was disappointed about how quickly the stripping guard wore out. I thought that may happen over the course of a season but not in 3 outings.",

Took less than an hour to get it set up with bike attached and I am not someone who typically does my own work on my bike so removing the rear wheel was a new experience.\r\n\r\nClear instructions, easy to follow. The most confusing part was trying to understand how to affix the included speed/cadence sensor to the rear wheel hub.  The instructions for this are small, and images were not helpful but once I figured out the steps, it was easy.\r\n\r\nWas up and riding a couple training rides on Rouvy, using the included free month trial code, by mid afternoon.  \r\n\r\nFirst impression is that I will be happily using this daily at least.",

        "reviewBody": "I bought these a size bigger than normal because I wear thick socks for hiking. They are comfortable and wide enough for my feet (I like wide toe boots). But the insoles are not glued in and on my right foot, it was moving half an inch within the first few minutes of walking, which was very uncomfortable. My boyfriend superglued the insole in, but if I&apos;m paying this much money, this shouldn&apos;t be something I have to deal with. I haven&apos;t done a long hike (over 6 miles) with them so the jury is still out. But they are very supportive around the ankle. There is not quite enough cushion on the insole on rocks, or so it feels now. Lowa needs to glue these insoles and make them a little thicker. The first day wearing them to the market they hurt my feet. But they are worked in a bit now and I tried them on a 6-mile hike and they were good. I wear wool socks for cushion and it&apos;s very hot - no airflow. I liked my La Sportivas for comfort but they came apart really quickly. Things are made cheaply now and hopefully these will last a bit. I think these Lowas are true to size but can&apos;t be sure.",

I tried ten different hiking boot brands prior to trip and chose these after much consideration. They’ve been fabulous   Comfortable and supportive and grippy. Room for my toes. Did pretty well in 80 inches of rain in 4 hours. However I am going to purchase the higher gotten style for next trip",

        "reviewBody": "I was initially very happy with these boots, having switched from a Merrill pair which were too clunky. These are handsome, comfortable and nicely supportive. They have a secure fit but there is room for my toes to breathe. If they did not have the Waterproof label I would have no complaints, but it does say WP, and they are NOT WP. Walking through a very wet field, the top of toe was soaked through. This was not immersion, just wet grass. and my socks got wet. It is disappointing. I may see if a spray will help but why do they advertise as waterproof?",

I don’t have any tiny edges so I can’t comment on their edging but they keep me on even the smallest of Metolius foot holds on both my vertical wall and 20 degree overhanging wall. The weather has not been cooler than 50 yet when I climb so I cannot comment on warmth yet.  They do seem to stretch. I wear a 43 in the TC and bought a 42 in the TC Extreme.  I have worn the shoes a half dozen times on my home wall so far and some stretching is occurring.  I like the shoes but might have wanted them in my 43 size.",

I was pleasantly surprised with the skirt! Color looks just as good online. Super cute and good fit (true to size). Flattering length (slightly longer than I expected but not in a bad way). Good quality. I was hoping it was a skort but with the slightly longer length, no worries. Love it!",

The faded spots along the waistline also disappointing. Didn’t even try it on.\nUsually love Kavu, have used many pieces through the years, but quality on this was lacking so have to return. Sad",

Plus In my experience many lightweight  puffy jackets have very small zippers that are worse than this one.   I love ortovox gear but their prices are ridiculous.. that said, if you wait you can find great deals. I got this jacket new for 70 bucks!  Their retail prices imo are crazy!  Congrats to those that can afford them.. but for me I&apos;ve always had to look for deals.  \nThis jacket is super ul, size large and about 10ozs.  Also, I think they made various improvements this year and most ortovox gear comes with at least a 2 year warranty and in many cases 5 years to lifetime.  I love the big pockets on this jacket and how comfortable it is.. it does run small.. I usually wear a large but this is very tight in the arms and shoulders..(6&apos;1 170lbs athletic build)  if you can find it on sale, it&apos;s definitely a great option for a Ul jacket.",

Ortovox, a European Manufacturer won&apos;t accept returns except through Backcountry and Backcountry will tell you that you must return the product directly to Ortovox.  When I complained, they told me the jacket was &quot;out of warranty&quot; without examining the jacket (I sent photos).  Don&apos;t waste your money on a technical jacket that is prone to failure because of poor construction and cheap materials.  The jacket was great but the zipper was the cheapest that I have ever seen on a technical piece of gear.  Not worth the risk!",

They came with some kind of oil on the bottoms, I guess to prevent them from cracking but I think customers should be warned. I wanted to return but she really wanted them, once we walked on the side walk the grip was great. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR BABIES OR TODDLERS LEARNING TO WALK. Stick to the previous model, we owned that pair and never had that issue.",

I like the big back pocket and big zipper pocket.  It is a really roomy pack.  There are minimal organizational pockets so we&apos;ll see how it goes if I try to use it for work or one of my kids steal it for school.  It does have a sleeve for laptop which is in a great spot.   Sports for pens, chargers, cables, small bottle of ibu, glasses cleaner, are sparse.  Also, no water bottle pocket which is probably the biggest down for me.",

Storage was well thought out with nothing wasted. No more searching through endless pockets, no more water bottles falling out and rolling around on the floor of the plane, no more wet gear if you get rained on. Recently had it loaded up with a 13&quot; laptop, 11&quot; iPad and a bunch of stuff for my 2 year old son, for a family vacation that involved flying across the country. The large front &quot;stash&quot; pocket saved us in the airport when I needed to stuff extra clothes, jacket and wipes into it on the run between gates. I highly recommend this pack to anyone looking for a new commuter/travel pack capable of handling any and all situations.",

At first the straps seemed flimsy but the CCubed technology feels just as durable and comfortable as traditional foam straps. Looking back I might have opted for the Chai color over the black. All in all Nemo has done it again and I support purchases of their products",

        "reviewBody": "I bought this backpack for traveling, specifically, a trip to Mexico. I had gone back and forth on a couple different bags, but settled on this one. I am glad I did. The 26L was the perfect size for what I was looking for. Something big enough to carry a couple books, laptop, chargers, etc. for the plane ride, then once at my destination use as a day pack. \r\n\r\nThe pack has an ample amount of pockets for organization of your freight. Smaller pockets for things like wallet, passport, etc. and then larger ones for bigger items. I really like the larger outer pocket that expands with side zippers. It is great for carrying an extra jacket/sweatshirt, shoes, or snorkeling fins.\r\n\r\nFit/finish and build quality are great, bag should last a long time. Looking forward to taking this pack on future trips.",

The zip solid pocket on one end is great for toiletries and small items. The elastic mesh pocket at the other works well for a waterproof or misc gear/ clothes. I really like that the inside life pocket is also a solid lining as it keeps books, magazines, and paperwork safe. \n\nThe materials and stitching are top rate. \n\nThe straps are comfortable however, I wish they were a more regular design running from one end of the bag to another. On this version they taper off to the side and getting the hand hold central to swap between rucksack and hold-all mode requires annoying strap adjustment.\n\nMinor point on a great bit of kit overall.",

        "reviewBody": "Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the shoulder strap, and the plastic hardware it utilized. I was incredibly surprised at the substandard quality allowed by MR this go around in my opinion. I once bought a simple ~15L &quot;gym bag&quot; style pack, yet the should strap hardware was metal, appeared to be stainless. So, although I did use the strap this trip and it did not fail, I firmly believe if my bag would have been heavier, it just might have. I am thankful that at the very least the webbing is sewn wide enough to use D rings to secure and utilize a shoulder strap when the plastic fails or breaks.\r\nHowever, a good bag for road trips, flights, etc where you don&apos;t want to use traditional luggage. Fits nicely in overhead of airplane. Can secure outer YKK Zippers with locks as well. Water/moisture resistant hardy outer material. Able to easily compartmentalize within.",

A collapsible water bottle pouch would be a nice feature to have on future versions.  The main compartments are wide open and dont have dividers - this could be a pro or con depending on how you pack.  The shoe pocket is big enough to hold GTX style boots.  They have not been used much yet, I expect it will hold up well.",

        "reviewBody": "I received my Mission Rover bag.\r\n\r\nI initially liked the old wax version because it looked a bit more dandy than the new one.\r\nSo I asked here to clarify the differences between the old wax version and the new one, but it&apos;s hard to tell exactly what the differences are other than the material and color.\r\nNow that I have the bag, I don&apos;t have the old version so I can&apos;t tell all the differences, but the build quality of the new version is very good.\r\nAnd the design looks even better in real life.\r\n\r\nThe water repellency of the material is so good that it looks like a pool of water.\r\nAnd the design of each compartment is very convenient.\r\nThe shoulder and waist straps are also comfortable enough, though not as comfortable as a mountaineering backpack.\r\nThe fact that you can hide the straps altogether and use it as a duffel bag if needed is a huge plus.\r\n\r\nI&apos;m particularly impressed with the YKK zippers, which open and close smoothly. \r\nI think it will be much more convenient to use than a hard carrier.\r\n\r\nThe front laptop compartment, which I was worried would be a bit small, fit my LG GRAM PRO 17” with ease.\r\nThe width, height, and thickness are all just right (keep in mind that even though it&apos;s 17”, it&apos;s designed to be very compact and slim).\r\n\r\nI&apos;m very pleased with this product and I think it will only get better with age.",

        "reviewBody": "I’ve been waiting for a month to write this review, because my last month was PACKED with travel and I wanted to road test this bag. \r\n\r\nAs someone who travels for a living, I use a lot of different bags and cases, from hard case Pelicans to soft goods like Mystery Ranch and North Face. I’ve been looking for a bag like this for short trips to carry on my luggage, and was considering the Cotopaxi version of this bag as well. \r\n\r\nI’m here to tell you that the Rover was the best choice. \r\n\r\nBesides its great design, ballistic construction, and quality materials (looking at you YKK zippers), the thought put into this bag is what makes me really happy. The backpack straps are great, but being able to put a shoulder strap is so helpful when having another backpack on. You can whip this thing around and take it off with ease. Not to mention the laptop pocket with all of its features. \r\n\r\nThis is a perfect “one bag for the trip” kind of luggage. I’m sure the other sizes are just as capable, but for a 6’4” man, this is a great size for an extra pair of shoes, a packable coat, and all the clothing you will need for a week (if you’re a smart packer).",

Anyway, I used this on my backpack strap while climbing a waterfall and not a single drop was inside under its force. Amazing. The only downside would be a mounting system where I would like to have something burlier, but I won’t downgrade my review because I was searching for something like this for years and my use case is a bit extreme. I like that it is well designed so I could DIY something more robust to hold it in place with ease. Thanks for this great piece of gear Osprey.",

The material was durable, rugged, and lasted for ages, while still looking crisp and clean.  I bought the current version of these pants and the material has changed.  It is kind of shiny, the cut fits different.  In the same size I normally get, the pants are shorter. The buttons have changed, and the material pills. So the newest Halle Pants that I have, now look like the oldest. Not so happy with these changes.",

However, I am straight and slender, but carry my weight in the middle.  These dug in just enough to give me a bit of a muffin top.  They MIGHT&apos;VE stretched out a bit and been ok, but I returned them.  The rest of the pant was great though.  I really liked the more normal sized pockets on the Halle II (the pockets on the Halle I are literally uselessly small).  I think these would work great for ladies that have a more normal waist than I do.",

The cut of the Halle II is roomier overall, I had to go down two sizes.  However, fit seems to be dependent on the color.  Slate Green fits perfectly so when I found Sandbar on sale at Backcountry I ordered two pairs.  Unfortunately I need to return them because they are cut about 1/2-1&quot; smaller than the Green.\nFor reference, I am 5&apos;2&quot;, 118 lbs.  I wear 4S in Original Halle and 0S in Halle II.",

        "reviewBody": "I recently purchased 3 more pairs of these pants in Sandbar, Slate Green and Moonrock to replace a previous generation&apos;s fleet of green, dark blue and khaki. These newer pants feel softer, yet seem equally as durable so far. I like the new features like the slot in back pocket for a pen- great for field work. The zipper pulls are easier to grab. The pant leg roll up buttons are only on the outside of the leg, which means there aren&apos;t nubbins rubbing against the inside of your knee. My older pairs, going on 5-6 years now, are now strictly outdoor pants for hiking, rock climbing and chopping firewood, as they&apos;re still hanging in quite well for the wear they&apos;ve had. I always air dry these pants, never in the dryer, and that has lengthened their elastic lifespan. These pants are great for work, around town, physical therapy, etc. I lived in Seattle and walked everywhere in the rain and loved how they didn&apos;t get sopping wet like other pants, and they dry fairly quickly. They also breathe well during activity in warmer months, climates. They fit well, are flattering and practical for someone with a more muscular and active build like myself- stronger thighs and butt, longer legs. So grateful for being able to feel good wearing a pair of pants made for active, strong women.",

I can say they fit true to size, but, it&apos;s tricky, as I have the 00/short and the length is good, waist too, but they&apos;re loose, not tight fitting on me, which is OK, but I wish they were a little more fitted. I still like them a lot, as they do fit.  I like the height of the waist band, not too high or low. Cinch tie on the waist along with the buttons, which is great for slight adjustments.  Overall, these are awesome, I&apos;d get another color if we had 00/short in stock :) !",

        "reviewBody": "The Sprint (and tool shelf) is much better conceived than the &quot;platform&quot; (or Euro-Type) repair stand that I had from Park Tool.  The Feedback Sports stand reflects a great deal of understanding of the intrinsic challenges that such a device requires.  Unlike the one-fits-all fork drop-outs that Park provides, the Sprint comes with a wide range of inserts to accommodate thru-axles (of varying cross sections and length) and varying quick-releases.  The support for the bottom bracket is adjustable back and forth to take into account both center-of-gravity and wheel base, as are the fork dropouts.  These features make balancing a wide spectrum of bikes well-suited to this stand.   As more riders are buying carbon fiber frames, the clamping necessary to support such a bike becomes increasingly problematic:  too little pressure and the bike moves too much;  too much pressure and you&apos;re looking at an expensive repair-in the best case.  Silca sells a Hirondelle bar for $185 (https://silca.cc/products/hirobel-clamp) that will keep your top tube safe, but the bar is multi-faceted and held in place only by rubber straps, which permits the bar to twist, and the bike along with it.  The cost of the Hirondelle bar only  will finance more than half the cost of the far more useful Sprint stand.   There is also   an available tool shelf that can be very convenient.",

        "reviewBody": "Pro mechanics use tri mounted stands. The versatility is perfect. From a quick clean to a drivetrain overhaul, this stand is adjustable to accommodate any project or repair. Adust the height and work on your bike at eye level. And spin it around with ease. After the first use, I immediately realized I have been wasting my money on clamp style stands. I use it with both my carbon road and carbon mountain bike. Some complaints are strange. If you find it too difficult to remove the front wheel in order to use the stand then you probably don&apos;t need any stand. Over time a serious recreational cyclist (or racer) learns there are a few &quot;must-haves&apos;. And this is one of them.",

I can&apos;t overstate the improved comfort over my old pack. I&apos;m carrying more weight, this pack being bigger, but it feels like I&apos;m carrying less. \n\nI&apos;ve used it for one season now, and am glad to have it. It&apos;s 40L, which is big for some tastes, but for me it&apos;s the perfect size for your standard gear plus a few backups, be that a second pair of gloves, extra water, or ski crampons. My former pack was 32L, and it was always a tight fit. \n\nThe only light criticisms I have with it is 1) I wish it had come with a helmet net--the one I bought doesn&apos;t fit as well as it should. And 2) the pack loses its structural integrity and folds over a little about halfway up when unzipping. It&apos;s a small thing, but an improved design or structure might keep this from happening when you&apos;re fiddling around in the snow with gloves on. Slight inconvenience. Still love the pack.",

The pack is light, the perfect amount of space for bigger days, colder weather, or even light multi-day travels. It can be tough to find packs that carry splitboards well, and this offers multiple carry options that all allow the airbag to deploy. The trigger is easy to pull. My only design feedback is the pocket where the avy gear goes (shovel, probe etc) is so deep that the gear slides to the bottom of it, and would take longer to get to if you had a full pack. I wish there was a way they stayed close to the top. I think this is a common problem with the larger airbag packs in general though.",
