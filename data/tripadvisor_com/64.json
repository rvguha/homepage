His selection of breweries and beers from each brewery were excellent. His appreciation of brewery owners who operate their business with a healthy socially responsibility is inspiring.

He had lots of stories and tons of information about the beer business and beer itself. We started at the Lagunitas tap room and went on to NWPeak and ended at Peddler Brewing Company. We tasted a surprisingly wide variety of beers in these three places. Lagers, IPAs, sours, stouts, we tasted them all. We learnt about different stages of brewing, the effects of adding hops at different stages of the brewing process, the difference in taste depending on the degree of barley roasting and so on. I would recommend this tour highly. It’s a fun outing, you hang out with a fun guide, you learn a lot about beer and seattle’s microbrewery scene, AND you get to drink great beer! What’s not to love, eh? "

The only date that worked for us was a Monday, and Seattle Brewery Walking Tours (SBWT) worked with us and we were able to go on the Fisherman's Terminal Tour. SBWT is headed up by a man named Tim, and he leads all of the tours. We met at Urban Family Brewing, and Tim gave us bags with taster glasses and papers with useful beer-related info. Tim went in and got us each a flight of 4 beers, and we worked our way through tasting each one and talking a bit about the history of each type of beer as well as the history of the brewery. At Figurehead Brewery, we were able to see some of the equipment and ingredients used in the beer making process, and at Rooftop bar, we met the owner and spoke with him about how he got started. Tim is pleasant, easy to talk to, and very knowledgable about beer. He seems to have a good rapport with the breweries and gives a great tour! We tasted 4 beers at each venue and it took 3-4 hrs. Very Enjoyable!"

He even created a beer guide, including an explanation of beer terminology, tasting sheets, and a pairing guide for participants. \nMost of all tho, the tour was a lot of fun. The breweries all seemed very popular with locals and we had a total of 3 flights with 4 small beers on each of them. Needles to say, I couldn't finish all of them - but I definitely had fun trying. As someone who isn't a beer expert at all, I really feel I learned a lot about the different brewing methods and my own taste on this tour. \nTim is a wonderful guide (our small group had a little meetup hiccup in the beginning which he managed smoothly) and I fully recommend taking this tour to learn more about Seattle's beer culture."

We learned SO much about beer and experienced an incredibly wide variety of tasting. Tim keeps his tours small so you can expect a lot of attention and Q&A opportunities. Most of the breweries don't have food so maybe bring some like snacks (nuts or pretzels) or have a solid meal before you go. It is a pretty good amount of beer and the \"tastings\" are pretty hardy. I would definitely recommend any of the tours to beers lovers, or even just beer likers, as everyone is bound to find a beer that suits their tastes :)  I look forward to taking another tour with Tim on our next visit to Seattle."

I am really looking forward to doing another of his tours but in a different area. We had a tremendously fun evening and I strongly recommend Tim to anyone who has even a vague interest in beer. Also afterwards we had the option of hanging about with him and his lovely wife but we had to head home back to the dogs-which in hindsight we could have brought with us."

The guides Michael and Whitney were knowledgeable and showed us some really amazing things. July was a perfect time to be in the mountains because the wildflowers were in bloom. Our tour culminated in a helicopter ride back to Seattle. It was a highly recommended experience, especially if you’re local and want to “get away”. "

Get the inside scoop on where chefs shop and where locals hang out. Enjoy diverse tastings at 4 different places — and food options like mocha, yogurt, chowder and more.

I & my kids both enjoyed the tour, and highly recommend it.  The tips for getting food more quickly from the chowder restaurant was nice, as well as the history on some of the shops.  Later, Sean even gave us some tips on restaurants outside the Market to try for other meals.  Thanks!"

It was great to have John along to skip all the very long longs to get our samples. It was a great variety of items to sample and it was fun to learn the history of the market. This was by far our favorite tour we did in Seattle. I highly recommend it to everyone."

Classic American cooking comes to the heart of the Emerald City, where you’ll enjoy a 2- or 3-course meal with your choice of theme. Each option comes with a drink (coffee, tea or soda) and dessert. Expect entrees like the classic cheeseburger, a half-rack of hickory-smoked ribs, salmon, steak and even some vegetarian options. Love All - Serve All!",

This Hard Rock was not busy and had this ‘menacing’ sign that 22% surcharge would be charged to every order.  When they sat us at our table they asked if we were OK with the surcharge.  There was a family of 4 behind us literally having an argument they would not come in because of the surcharge poster.  \n\nWe just ordered a couple of local brews and some nachos to share.  The Nachos were soggy.  Our waitress was extremely peppy and helpful.  We asked her if she would get any of the 22% surcharge so we would know how to tip for her good service.  She said the staff gets 17% of that 22% surcharge and the rest goes to Hard Rock.  Personally, I think the uninformative messaging about the surcharge deters business."

Our waitress was fine and the order for food and drink taken promptly. Drinks arrived ok and we waited for food. I had the Salmon on a plank and it was served at the same time as my partners salad for their chicken and beef fajitas but the chicken and beef didn’t turn up, it was serviced by a different waiter who said the rest was on its way. I started my food but ate slowly so my partner could join but even so I had nearly finished when theirs turned up, again delivered by a different waiter. The food was decent but it is not acceptable to serve the meal separately the way it was. I did not leave any tip when I paid the bill but I did give the waitress a small cash tip as she had been done a good job and explained to her why I wasn’t tipping anyone else.\nI will not go there again and will think twice now about going to any other branch."

We opted for the roof terrace - the server was ok although we requested our starters and mains didn’t come out at the same time as recent previous USA restaurants did - we were assured this wouldn’t happen, but it did. Nacho starter a little on the cold side, but loaded really well. We sent back the mains as we were still eating the nachos. Mains came back out and were cooked well. Food on the whole cooked well. And I opted to only pay 10% gratuity which is all I felt was deserved. \nWe went to the rock store and no pint glasses - we have been to 58 Hard Rock Cafe’s over the world and have a pint glass from each - this store had none and the server was nonplussed that they had none - really poor. But actually we blame the owners of the franchise’s  more -  they are no longer interested in the principle of Hard Rock Cafe just how much money they can make from the hotels and casinos- destroying everything established by the original Hard Rock Cafe in London. We used to track hard rock cafes across the world but we will be not any more. In future we will pop in for a drink to say we have visited but I won’t be paying for over priced mediocre food."

When I looked at the menu and the average price of a meal was around $20+ and with a party of four before any drinks would put the average bill over $90.  At 22%, that’s up to $20 gratuity before you even see your server.  \nI believe in the tipping system starting at 18% and go up from there but to enforce a 22% coming from an institution like the Hard Rock Café will leave a horrible taste in your mouth.\nI’ve visited over 50 Hard Rock Café’s over my time and this experience may have put an end to it."

Service was beyond awful, then to top it off, food was also pretty bad. Fries & kids meal were ok (came out way before adult meals which was nice but then adult meals took so long to come)  but chicken sandwiches super dry. The server literally went out of his way to not come by, We had to flag him down anytime we needed something and each time he said he would be back and never came back.  Someone else brought out food thankfully or we prob never would have gotten any. it was not good.  We never got drink refills, and drinks were gone well before food arrived. Server flagged down and said he would bring but they never came. The place was not busy, lunch took so long my son went to sleep. We really shouldn't have paid, it as that bad but we had to go to the airport and we had been there so long we wanted to GTFO.  This place was so bad it has become an ongoing family joke. \"At least its not the Hard Rock Seattle,\" & \"cant be as bad as Hard Rock,Seattle.\"  I'd say anyone could have a bad day, but not a single employee seemed to notice or care how bad it was so might just be their norm. I'd avoid."

Our guides craft itineraries that reflect the best of what the Park has to offer that day, including group interests and dynamics. Please note that the itinerary outlined is a SAMPLE of potential destinations that could be included in the tour.\n\nOur Deception Pass State Park Tour from Seattle is an excellent way to spend a day outside of the city. Located on the northern end of the largest island in the Salish Sea, Deception Pass provides unparalleled opportunities to experience the true Pacific Northwest with miles of rugged coast, massive old growth trees, and adrenaline pumping bridges. \n\nThis small-group day trip limited to 10 people includes French-pressed coffee & tea, pastries, light snacks, a picnic-style lunch and downtown Seattle pick-up and drop-off. Don't worry about a thing.",

The hike was great, and Matthew even brought walking sticks, snacks, drinks, and a picnic lunch for our group of 9 on this trip. Matthew brought binoculars for the whale-watching tour at Anacortes also—many thanks! I was using his binoculars when four Orcas decided to breach. Wonderful tour, wonderful tour guide. Highly recommend!"

I chose this tour because I liked the balance between outdoor experiences in the Skagit Valley and Deception Pass and the history aspects at the military fort and local farms. We were able to see so many birds at the first stop - large white swans in the hundreds- took a beautiful morning hike along a trail at the park, and enjoyed some delicious fruit wines at the last stop. We had Dan as our guide, who was so knowledgeable about everything we were seeing, especially all the birds(!!) and really made this experience a day we will never forget.  My friends and I really enjoyed exploring the old fort where you can wander through all of the bunkers, it really takes you back in time!  I would recommend this tour for anyone looking for a fun outing from Seattle with a little bit of hiking, a little bit of history, a little bit of wildlife sightings and a lot of amazing views! Thanks Dan and Evergreen Escapes for an amazing day trip!"

    "description": "In creating this Seattle tour for 2018, we set out to make the tour our guides want to go on with friends. We made a tour that keeps people outside, touches many of the highlights and hidden facets of Seattle that make it…well, Seattle, and we make sure that we eat and drink well all day!  This small-group day trip limited to 10 people includes French-pressed coffee & tea, pastries, light snacks, local wine tasting and downtown Seattle hotel transport by luxury vehicle.\n\nLunch is on our own--but only because we visit the famous Ballard Farmer's Market and travelers like to try many different cuisines and options!",
