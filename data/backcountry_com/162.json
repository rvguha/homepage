        "reviewBody": "I just moved to Salt Lake City and needed a jacket that would encourage me to get out and go for a walk during the winter. It’s like wearing a sleeping bag. I am so so thankful i bought it. I also bought an outdoor research jacket that was shorter and has a gortex shell. I believe the gortex does help keep the warm in, will obviously protect against wind and rain, but the length of this one makes a difference. It’s still very warm despite not having the gortex outter and the length really does add a component of warmth to my legs and body. Highly recommend",

It protects my legs and butt while out there. It has three zips (one in front and two on sides), so you can do almost\n anything while wearing it. It is light but warm.

For being so lightweight it helped keep the wind from cutting through and held up on windy boat tours. I did see a couple feathers pop out here and there but nothing major. I bought the black version and it did pick up a couple mysterious stains but I really did put it through the wringer. The puffy hood was really nice but didn’t cinch to my face very well so when it was extra windy I layered a fleece hood underneath, highly recommend.",

I’d like to see the sizing a bit more consistent - it definitely runs large and even the XS has room to spare for me when I normally wear a Small in OR tops. I’d also love a slicker outer material; the current fabric is matte and does tend to pick up lint and hair more easily than a slick fabric would. However, those are small gripes. The parka is SO warm and cozy.\nJust perfect for truly cold winter weather or gusty chilled winds. The hood and baffled neck keep out cold and all the little touches down to the zipper pulls and soft lined deep pockets make this feel like a really high end garment. It’s worth the retail price but I managed to get mine half off during a big sale and I feel like I won the lottery with it!",

And being semi retired, that is a lot more time than usual.  I now only wear shoes when I have to go to work.  The quality and especially the comfort of these is the highest I have ever experienced with flip flops.  A bit more expensive than all others I have bought, but Oh So Worth It!  I&apos;m saving money on shoes and getting comfort and breathability in return.  Will definitely purchase more when these start to show wear and tear.  I can&apos;t recommend these enough!!",

The first couple of times I wore it as a windbreaker and it was perfectly fine; the first time I wore it in the rain I got soaked through but by then it was too late to return. Since then it has kept me dry in a drizzle but harder rain tends to go through the jacket. The lining also started shedding about a year ago, just little bits of white material at first but now when I take the jacket off I&apos;m covered in flakes. Really disappointed in the quality and will be staying away from Marmot products in the future!",

The first year or two they work great to keep me dry, but the water repellency wears off after that time.  After a rainstorm, I noticed my arms were wet underneath the jacket.  I read that washing with conventional detergent damages water repellency.  I have tried treating them with Nik Wax, but it may have been too late.  In each case, I just purchased a new one.   Returning this because it runs small through the middle and the hips.  I need a size L.",

For reference I&apos;m 5&apos;8&quot; / 150 lbs and a size 10 (36 B/C).  I have fairly long arms and legs and the arms on this went about 5-6 inches too long.  I also absolutely SWAM in this thing, even taking layering into consideration.  Still, I thought it looked decent for the $67 deal I received.  I called and arranged the exchange.  Well, they screwed that up and sent yet another Large when I had asked for a Medium (knowing that too, was gonna be oversized).\n\nAfter reading the other reviews and having inspected the garment before sending back, I agree with those reviewers who said that it was not waterproof or even water resistant.  It&apos;s more like a soft cotton/twill shell.  I can&apos;t speak to whether the seams were sealed as they claim, but I can say with certainty there was nothing water resistant to the fabric itself.  After reading about zipper issues and everything else, I went ahead and arranged for yet another return.  \n\nBoth times i had to drive these packages to the nearest FedEx box, which was a hassle.  I asked for them to pick it up from my house on the second merry-go-round and was told they could not offer that.  I told them, &quot;I should&apos;ve guessed that would be the case&quot; as this is Steep and Cheap.",

This feels like an obvious cash-grab by listing the product at $219 and deeply discounting it. The seams certainly are not sealed, and it looks like water and wind would have no problem getting through them. If you want to market this as a budget soft-shell type jacket, fine. But this is NOT a ski/snowboard jacket, unless one is skiing indoors. \n\nI was very excited to buy this as a gift, but now cannot wait for my return to process.

Every time I bent over the bottom zipper would start to unzip. It’s good looking jacket but unless you’re built like model and are trying to wear a few more layers underneath for warmth I would not recommend.",

        "reviewBody": "Found ourselves in a last-minute crunch for a bike rack for a trip. A friend recommended this Yakima FullBack, so we ordered and we paid for expedited shipping. The expedited option said shipping would take 2-days and given the bulk/weight of this item I was skeptical that it would arrive that quickly. I did a chat with Backcountry and they confirmed that 2-day was possible. And to our complete relief that&apos;s exactly what happened! Though the product went from UT to TN before delivery in CA, it all happened in 2 days. Installation of the rack on the back of our SUV was pretty straightforward, rack is solid and reliable as long as you follow instructions, and be sure when they tell you to go to the fit guide on Yakima&apos;s website to get extra instructions for your particular vehicle that you do it! Anyway, Backcountry is now my default, go-to outdoor/rec equipment resource. THANK YOU BACKCOUNTRY!!",

I bought a women forte so I can give my men&apos;s forte to my boyfriend who is 6ft. I tought it would be similar. It is not. I feel too tight, cant move around in it. Also there are two zippers instead of one for the vents , it tends to get stuck.. So disapointed.. Might check for a tempo men instead.. or buy the forte men again..",

          "Thank you for taking the time to leave a review but I&apos;m sorry to hear about this experience! The standardized testing used to assign temperature ratings to sleeping bags (the ISO Test) provides three temperature thresholds to help guide users, a COMFORT rating, a LIMIT rating, and an EXTREME rating. The names can be a bit misleading, but the reason for offering all three is because sleep comfort is a very personal preference, and whether you sleep warm or cold at night determines how much insulation you need in your bag. Be on the lookout for an email from our customer service team. Thank you again for the review!"

It doesn&apos;t make sense when other companies offer the choice of zipper on the left or right, especially if you&apos;re emphasizing that your bags can be zipped together. You&apos;re alienating your queer customer base. I&apos;ve seen those comments from years ago that you&apos;re &quot;doing something about it&quot;. Do better, Nemo.\r\n\r\nNot to mention that once I did actually zip my Forte up with another Forte (men&apos;s endless promise), my zipper was several inches longer despite both being the long size.\r\n\r\nAnd after my first trip, the material in the heat vents has caught in the zipper, rendering it useless. Great idea (we did use them) but poor execution.",

        "comment": [
          "Thank you so much for your feedback! The significant difference between men&apos;s and women&apos;s bags are the temperature ratings — women&apos;s bags are rated to an EN Comfort standard, which sleep a little warmer. However, you are correct that the temperature ratings, sizes and zippers do not need to be gender-based, and while this has been the standard naming convention within the industry in the past, it is definitely something we are looking at changing. We&apos;ll reach out to you directly regarding the zipper on the Thermo Gill™ vents getting caught. That is certainly something that we can help with. "

The Nemo Forte definitely checked all of those boxes. I used it on my last camping trip and had the best night of sleep I&apos;ve ever had camping. The separate storage mesh and compression bags are also nice to have. I had some trouble stuffing into the compression bag but my husband had no trouble at all.

My husband and I both have this jacket (he has the men&apos;s version).  It is a very warm jacket.  I highly recommend a wicking layer underneath your clothes because once you get moving, you&apos;ll sweat a bit.  Also, size up from what your t-shirt size is so it has enough room to loft.  I wear a Medium T-shirt, and sometimes a Large and I got a large.",

That said, it doesn&apos;t quite match the warmth of my previous down jacket bought in Scandinavia over 20 years ago, and I doubt it will last half as long! \n\nI use it just for normal wear around town and occasional festival (I&apos;m not a sports person so it will not be used for any sports or outdoor activities)... so I did mull over the purchase for a while before deciding.. it&apos;s quite a lot of money! But I did need a warm jacket to face the winter, so here we are. \n\nI&apos;ve been using it for 3 weeks and it has done OK. The Orion blue/orange combo is very nice, and the sizing is generous - only the sleeves are too long for me as I&apos;m quite petite.. but I&apos;m used to that problem. \n\nThe big issue with it: it sheds a lot of the feathers/down! At this rate, the Mythic will be nothing but a fabric shell in 5 years time. Disappointing, for the price.",

        "reviewBody": "This is a great jacket. I wore the men’s XL most of last winter including six weeks of skiing Alta/Snowbird in some of the biggest powder days of my life. My wife started bundling up in my jacket at night and this week we bought her one of her own. The sizing chart said she was either a XL or a large because of her bust size (43”) and her wide shoulders. Well the large size was huge on her. So we ordered the medium size and it came today. It fits her perfectly. From my experience alpine skiing and snowshoeing in my XL jacket last winter, we know this is a fantastic jacket. Terrific warmth to weight ratio, extremely light, excellent zippers, good length, very well made and durable. My wife’s sizing dimensions are in the boxes. For the men’s XL, I’m 6’1”, 207 lbs., normal size shoulders, 34” to 35” shirt sleeves. XL fits me slightly loose. A large would be too small for me. Sleeves are too long on the XL. Perfect length of jacket body. I have a tall upper body. Only thing I’d do to improve the Mythic Ultra jacket is to add a large mesh inside pocket.",

I’m not a huge fan of layering a lot underneath, so I ordered my normal size. When trying it on, I had no complaints except that it fit really big. Sleeves were long and and about an inch of room on either side of my hips. I have a pear shape, I’m 5’5” and 125lbs and ordered a small. I wasn’t seeing many reviews about the jacket running big on people, so I hope this is helpful! I think I’m going to reorder an X-small.",

Bought a pair when I was 16 years old and I am not going to tell you what year that was but needless to say they were the best real hiking boots that I have ever had the pleasure of owning. Since then I have searched high and low for a comparable pair both in price and quality. I don&apos;t mind spending a few dollars more if that translates to better quality. Unfortunately it doesn&apos;t. I have owned many different pairs from many different manufacturers but in the end it has come down to Vasque. In quality, performance and value for the dollar. Right now I own two pairs of the Juxt and they are almost 8 years old and still have at least another 5 years of life if not more. And they are my go to shoe, for daily wear casual as well as hiking. They are great approach shoes, sturdy, comfortable and trustworthy.\r\nThank you for keeping your product real and not falling victim to the least expensive outsourcing manufacturers that so many of your competitors have to there regrets.\r\nSincerely Brian B.",

I thought the La Sportiva&apos;s I bought would work but when I started hiking more than 3 miles in them, after a long break-in period, my feet hurt. I practically gave up on hiking boots and figured I&apos;d just wear my Hoka light trail running shoes for hikes. But I decided to hike Mount Kilimanjaro next summer and need to have hiking boots for the summit day that can get as cold as -25 Fahrenheit. I hiked 6 miles with 2,100 feet of elevation gain and loss on a tricky trail with roots, rocks, and bouldering in these boots yesterday and my feet were in heaven. These are wearable right out of the box. They&apos;re just what I hoped they&apos;d be: like my super cushioned running Hokas but with the stability of a boot. I no longer need to worry about what boot I&apos;ll wear and can focus on training. I wear a 7.5 in my Hoka trail running shoes and the 7.5 in these fit just right.",

I should&apos;ve paid more attention to that. I hate that they do not zipper close. There is one breast pocket with a zipper, which would be great if I could keep my phone in it, but I have a pacemaker and it cannot be that close to my phone. Additionally, no woman wants a chest pocket with a lot of stuff sticking out in it. If only you had put zippers in the other two pockets, it would be a perfect jacket.",

I bought the xs (5’ 110lbs) and have room for light layering underneath.  On the shortcomings vs the arcteryx,  I wish the hand pockets had zippers and the cuffs were more substantial than an elastic band.  I usually buy black, but I got the dark blue and I’m so glad I changed.  Overall, i Love it and would buy again.",

It&apos;s a synthetic fill (prima loft) with a high warmth to weight ratio making it very packable. I also find that it is a bit dressier in appearance than comparable styles from other brands. The chest zipper pocket is quite big. I can fit my Iphone, keys a and a small wallet inside. The hip pockets are also deep enough that I can leave my phone in there while biking and not worry about it falling out.  When it gets below 30 degrees, I switch over to my Keb Touring Down Jacket.

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve had this jacket for a couple months now; it&apos;s come along on a few great treks through the mountains and also been a great lightweight cold weather jacket on my walks to work in Boston. I recently took a trip to the Grand Canyon, in which we did an 11 mile hike with 3,000 ft of elevation gain. That&apos;s when I really got to see the beauty of this jacket. The night before our trek it had snowed 6-8 inches and the snow was still coming down as we were going out in the morning. It was about 28 degrees with wind chill but I knew as we descended the temps would rise to about 60 degrees. I layered up with my Singi Merino Henley as a base layer, a lightweight vest as my mid layer, the Keb Padded Hoodie as another mid layer, and then a shell as my outer layer for the precipitation that was still coming down. It didn&apos;t take long into the trek for me to start shedding layers but the Keb Padded Hoodie stayed on almost the entire time. It&apos;s lightweight and extremely breathable so even when the temps got to around 50 degrees I still found myself with this layer on. When I did decide to take it off, I only had a 9 liter pack on my back so it&apos;s packability came in extremely handy. \n\nI would highly recommend this jacket for every day use and for trekking. It&apos;s a necessity for me on any trek that requires a jacket layer.",

This is an unfortunate side effect of using products that generate a high amount of air resistance, such as Thule SnowPack Extender. The wide, flat face of the carrier will present a barrier to wind passing over the vehicle, causing the buffering sound. Removing the carrier using the easy-to-use SpeedLink assembly when not in use is advised, but the addition of a Thule AirScreen XT fairing can also reduce wind noise."

Unfortunately, this is likely to happen with any additional accessory added to the roof of an otherwise aerodynamic vehicle, particularly one with a large flat plane and a gap in the middle that prevents even air flow. This is one of the reasons Thule recommends removing accessories like Thule SnowPack Extender when not in use. Doing so should eliminate any additional noise."

I selected 2 kits @ $17.99 each, and felt lucky to have found such a great deal. The photo that shows up next to my order is the 10 person 28 day medical kit. However, I received 2 of the Day Tripper Lite kits. Even now when you select the Day Tripper Lite kit, it shows the Mountaineer kit which is the 10 person 28 day version. I contact customer service via chat and after explaining myself multiple times. The backcountry rep offered to exchange the med kits, but then told me that I would have to pay full price for the replacement kids. I have no use for the smallest kits, and would never have ordered them. I am not a happy customer.",

There was  a  picture of  the  rechargeable battery with every step  of  my  order.   I  got  charged 38.16 and  with  the  hassle  of  calling  them , waiting ,  getting a label  and  sending  the  belt  clip  back .  They reimbursed   me  24.31.  I&apos;m out the difference and  have  no  product.   I  wrote  a  bad  review  on  Google that  since   has  disappeared.",

However - the front forehead pad is like a sponge. The pad gets DRENCHED with sweat and it just runs into my glasses. I’ve never had this issue, this bad, with any other helmet. You basically need to wear a hat or bandana to make it bearable. I can’t understand why they didn’t just use the printed rubber that the other interior pads have. IMO it to the point where I would pass on this helmet.",

The helmet has great air flow and covers my very bald to balding head from the sun.  But it does not fit my head probably due to shape.  I had red marks on my scalp where the pads were pressing tighter than others.  I did not have the helmet on wrenched down tightly.  If it had not been for the fit I would have loved to kept this helmet—although white color would have been more preferable.",

Its not as well ventilated as other helmets, but the real issue is the padding or padding arrangement that channels sweat directly into my eyes.  As in there is no absorption in the padding.

Really disappointing. The top snaps do not align well and I think the replacement lens is actually manufactured a bit off. Won&apos;t recommend these if your aim is to switch lenses for light/weather changes. Just buy a second set of goggles.",

I am short with an athletic build and really struggle to find things that fit well because I don&apos;t have a typical body type. This bib fits and looks great in my normal size. It&apos;s compressive but comfortable enough to be a good daily driver. The Chamois is high quality and comfortable for the 60+ mile rides I do and the construction feels durable and long-lasting.",

Well it’s not. \r\nLet me preach on it. \r\n\r\nThis bike turns like it’s on rails, climbs like a goat (as long as the motor holds up, a’hem) and although it will never match a fs bike going down, it’s still a load of fun to ride this thing fast through the woods. \r\nI’m happy with my purchase",

The fit is a little narower than other Altras and the length feels a little longer. I tried half sizing down but they were too narrow/tight. The bad: The materials for this shoe are not durable. I started getting a hole in the left shoe before 30 days and now a hole in the right shoe shortly after 30 days. The hole is where your toes bend in the shoes. I cannot recommend this shoe given the cost how quickly they deteriorate",

Please, please start listening to the people that were loyal to your brand and it&apos;s not just me, I know a lot of people that have changed to Topo but like many of those that have tried the arch support of Topo kills me. I&apos;ve tried many iterations and models of Altra and the Escalantes and the Torins have fit best altough not sure about the Escalante 4 since I bought mulitiple of the 3 since I liked them and the reviews of the 4 are not as strong as the 3. Have other COMPLETELY separate models if you are trying to get more market share for the masses, but I&apos;m running (didn&apos;t know that pun was going to happen) out of options and I so far haven&apos;t found another brand that fits better. Hoping you can get back to your roots with the fit that got you a following in the first place. Cheers, Richard",

Feels ok with perfectly straight walking or running, but any lateral movement or uneven ground forces the hard plastic in the heel to dig into my ankle below the protrusion on both the medial and lateral sides. Loved the way the Torin 6 and 5 had a soft heel counter. Hopefully on the 8 they can fix this.",

        "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been testing these out with 5K tempo runs. The fit is familiar as I started in Altras with the Escalante Racer (6/5 would recommend). Despite fitting well I found other Escalante models (2.5 &amp; 3) to feel like running with planks on my feet. The Torins show very little of that problem so far. The midsole feels responsive but not cushy or bouncy. The energy return seems fairly low. Generally I don&apos;t mind these things but I am having doubts about making them my marathon shoe. I wish there was a standard footshape version of the Vanish series. Make it so! I&apos;ve worn the Provision 7 and found them to less responsive but to feel a little more cushy compared to the Torin 7. The fit of the Provision was slightly tighter in the toebox and overall not quite right. Enough to be uncomfortable over a longer run (10K+ for me). So far the upper is fine. Heel hold is good. Midfoot feels secure but not constricted. I have not had them long enough to note much else other than they are all PLAIN. I hope you are hearing this a lot. Altra, you need better color options. Think brighter, go nuts, give me more COLORS. I&apos;m tired of black, white, grey, black &amp; white, and maybe green. You actually did that with the Escalante 4!!! (Which I&apos;m looking forward to). End rant. Torin 7: 4/5. Could be a 5/5 with some of that Ego Pro midsole. Make it so! -Tode",

        "reviewBody": "This fleece hooded jacket is an excellent choice for those kids who love to stay outdoors. The material is soft, cozy, lightweight, and provides just enough warmth during cooler weather. It&apos;s a versatile enough piece of garment to wear on its own or layer under a heavier coat on colder days.\n\nIt fits great, neither too tight nor too loose, and allows kids to move freely during all of their activities. The hood adds extra protection from the wind, and the pockets are perfect for warming hands or storing small treasures. It is also very durable and holds up quite well after repeated washes; it stays soft and looks like new.\n\nIf you’re looking for a reliable, comfortable, and stylish jacket for your child, this one is a 5-star pick. Columbia delivers excellent quality every time!",

They&apos;ve done away with the rubber on the strap which is what caused me to claim on my warranty from version one so this is a welcome change. The new inserts are better and have more configurations than version 1 and are more sturdy. Downsides to this bag is I think it&apos;s about 20% smaller than version 1. The front pocket is substantially smaller and they&apos;ve done away with the red and green stitching on the pockets which was great for knowing which pockets contained used memory cards and batteries and which were good to go. They&apos;ve replaced that with a notch or light grey stick hinge and a notch of dark grey.. so I guess you&apos;ll have to decide which one means which and remember it.",

        "reviewBody": "About 35 years ago, I traded my French hardshell helmet--the only hardshell on the market at the time and perfect for mountain biking--for the first American hardshell I found, the Giro Hammerhead.  It was half the weight of the French helmet, and had a thin hardshell and excellent ventilation.  A few months later I went down in a low water crossing, slamming the back of my head on the slippery concrete, and rode away due to the excellent protection. I replaced it with the same helmet and kept replacing it with Giro&apos;s for a number of years. I&apos;m coming off about 10 years of Specialized&apos;s previous Ambush usage and might have stuck with that model had they not changed it so much. So, looking around, I found this helmet, read up on it, and bought it.  And July in Texas is a good test for ventilation and general comfort.\r\nVentilation? Excellent. Better than the Ambush, and the Ambush was really good.  Comfort? The frame snugs around my head, the padding is pretty minimalist but is very comfortable.\r\n\r\nI&apos;m still tweaking the adjustable rear frame, because if the helmet doesn&apos;t sit just right on the head, the front vent rails are in one&apos;s upper vision. The visor, too, doesn&apos;t really come down as far as it should for early morning light.\r\n\r\nStill, it&apos;s very comfy, great ventilation and I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to buy again.  Just like my original Hammerhead",

        "reviewBody": "Let me start by saying, I generally have liked Big Agnes products in the past.  In fact, my daughter uses a prior year Torchlight sleeping bag and likes it very much.  I decided to stay within the series and try this one out - and it&apos;s an over-designed miss for a kids sleeping bag.\n\nMy problem is both with the bag AND the marketing description, write up and features.  \n\nFirst of all - the bag materials and fill quality feel good.  Some extra kid&apos;s specific features - not necessary, but fine.\n\nThe downfall of the bag is that there is zero insulation along the back of the torso of the sleeping bag.  Zero.  It&apos;s two thin layers of poly rip stop.  That&apos;s it.  It&apos;s not like they missed the fill in that zone, it&apos;s apparently designed that way, due to the fact that it CAN be used with the attached sleeping pad sleeve.  It&apos;s great to have a sleeping pad sleeve / holder - great feature for a kid to have, but there are situations where the padding and the insulation of the back torso are wanted... for instance, sleeping on a queen mattress and rolling to one&apos;s side...\n\nSo basically, by removing the insulation on the back, they&apos;ve pigeon-holed a child to only be able to use their sleeping bag, with a perfectly sized sleeping pad (sold also by Big Agnes).  It&apos;s a single use case scenario... which for a kids sleeping bag is not ideal - whereas it should be more of a universal thing for 99% of the population.  \n\nMy second gripe about this is that nowhere on the backcountry.com site is there anything about the lack of back insulation.  There is no mention that a sleeping pad is REQUIRED to be paired with this bag.  It&apos;s obvious it&apos;s an option with the design of the sleeve - but zero mention of the necessity to have on for comfort.  I went back and checked extensively.  The only place it&apos;s even mentioned on the Big Agnes website is in a small icon, buried in the features accordion - not even mentioned as a disclaimer or anything in the main bullet points.  \n\nI feel that neither backcountry or big agnes did their job to properly communicate and inform parents of the critical details of this sleeping bag - that it is part of a required system... And it&apos;s also disappointing that BA didn&apos;t just include a few more ounces of fill in the back - it wouldn&apos;t have been a deal breaker on weight, packability, or cost.  Ultimately, it wouldn&apos;t have impacted it&apos;s ability to used as a system or as a stand alone piece.",

I have been doing this for quite a while now and have had a lot of good kayaks. Some were longer and some shorter, all had their good and not so good.  One and larger chop, cross winds and both at the same time and my 11xt has handled it all with the grace of a well designed boat. Cudos Old Town and thank you Lancaster marine for keeping me on the water.  68 years old and still doing what I love best.",

        "reviewBody": "This is my second year with this kayak, I love the simplicity, stability and spaciousness. I tried a more expensive and better rated kayak, but after a third try, I decided to stick to my Old Town.  I like that I can stretch my legs or sit cross legged. The hatch has plenty of room. I appreciate that it only ways 41 lbs, making it easier to load and maneuver on the water.  On one occasion, I ended up in a river with a bit more action than I expected, but it performed quite well, leaving me to feel safe.  It takes more effort to travel in a straight path in strong winds, but not more so than other more expensive kayaks who boast being the best.",

        "reviewBody": "Honestly, I wish I hadn&apos;t bought it. I can understand why it would work for some people however I stand at 164cm so not very tall and it is very small. I also only sleep in a hammock so there isn&apos;t much room to move but I often feel constricted if I have the hood up. Lying flat in a tent may work better. Having just done 2 large hikes sleeping in temperatures ranging 0 - 7 degrees, I doubt that I would be comfortable in -13, and I am equipped with a very good sleeping mat and thermals. I slept comfortably but could feel the cold. I would say the EN rating is accurate on this one and saying that, there are cheaper and larger Rab sleeping bags that stuff down to a much smaller size that would have been more appropriate for me. It doesn&apos;t come with a net sack for storage and the stuff sack is not the same design as the other Rab sleeping bags I looked into and it is not as practical either. I don&apos;t really understand why they use this stuff sack as it doesn&apos;t allow making it as small as possible. The bag is comfortable and warm however just not for me. If I hadn&apos;t left the country I would have preferred to exchange it as I do like other Rab products.",

LUCKILY I was checking on it to see how it is going with the wind and guess what?! it was on fire!!! it damaged the whole plastic part and the ignater.. Buying such an expensive, high end (supposedly) product, shouldn&apos;t be made of such flammable material!!! so disappointed.. a refund or replacement is demanded..\n\nPlease reach out to me for images.",

I wear a 9.5 running shoe and, while I was nervous following the size guide (fine print indicated 88% chance of being correct), the recommended size 9 was spot on.  Toe box is just right.  The sole is appropriately rigid for my riding purposes; I did not have foot fatigue after ride and also was able to walk in them without issue.   Only bother is the &quot;Adidas&quot; logo tab on the top of the tongue, which sticks up beyond the tongue by about a quarter inch - you can see it in the picture of the shoe.  It is fairly rigid at the tip due to stitching and serves no purpose that I can see (maybe some run laces through it).  I wear low socks and it lightly rubs the bare skin just above my ankle crease.  Going to remove it and happily ride on in these great shoes!",

I will need to order another pair of gloves, unfortunately did not ski with these until after 30 day return period.  Will be using these gloves to shovel snow in driveway, not a warm ski glove, just fair weather.",

The bra is so comfortable and fits perfectly, and is long enough on the bottom that I feel comfortable wearing just that as a top when I&apos;m out in the woods. It dries quickly. I wanted something that could double as a swimsuit so I don&apos;t have to carry as much on backpacking trips. And the give and go bikini briefs fit really well and I love the fabric. I&apos;d like to replace most of my underwear with these, even for everyday wear. Highly recommend this brand. And not overly priced either, well worth what you&apos;re paying for them.",

I love the laptop pocket on this and being able to access from both the top and back panel zipper. It fits my 13&quot; laptop perfectly. Another awesome pocket in the valuables pocket towards the bottom of the back panel. This pocket is great for storing a passport or wallet while traveling through airports where you want to keep small items more secure. After several months of daily use back and forth to work, around town, and through the airport, this thing still has not shown an signs of wear.",

The cut is perfect for wearing under short shorts or high waisted bottoms. No panty or thong lines and the sides don&apos;t roll. The fabric is weightless and it&apos;s really true that you can take 2 pairs and go anywhere! One to wear, one to spare! They dry overnight and don&apos;t stretch out. I just want more colors.",

The colors are so cute, and it&apos;s a great size, not too big but with the two pockets you can fit quite a lot in it, and keep your keys separate from your phone so it doesn&apos;t get scratched. The strap is also very adjustable, so it fits my small waist but could easily be bigger to wear around your chest/shoulders too.",

So glad this pack was the right size and it?s perfect for everything I want to put in it. It works great when you go on walks, hiking and anything else that requires you to down size from your everyday purse to the hip pack. Love it! Highly recommend!",

Basically, the sole is narrower than the foot part, and they&apos;re so stiff that once you start to roll, it&apos;s game over. \n\nBummed because they fit my wide feet better than most other options for approach shoes. Beware!",

        "reviewBody": "Sadly it arrived with the nose dinged cause the cardboard housings inside the box that are supposed to protect nose and tail are assembled with big copper staples and the board hit these during normal transportation and handling. The staples are actually placed at the bottom of the cardboard housings but somebody flipped one over (upside down) along the way, probably during customs inspection, so the nose due to its concave shape, matched the exact position of the staples and got screwed up.\n\nThis is definitely a package design flaw. There is no warning or indications on how to carefully place the housings back into the box that can alert any one who inspects it&apos;s contents. For shippers or customs would be really difficult to figure out that the packaging it self can damage the product if they don&apos;t re-pack everything back carefully (original factory packaging). This is not the responsibility of  Back Country but Global Surf Industries Packaging designers&apos;. \n\nUPDATE!\nI also noticed some kind of small dings along the right rail, near the tail that have already been filled with resin (look a bit yellowish and with some bubbling), probably a repair done at the factory. These boards are made in Chyna, which I&apos;m not a fan of for many reasons, just so you know.\n  \n I reported this incident to Backcountry CS and they kindly offered me to return the board or to keep it and receive some cashback via store credit just to cheer things up. I can&apos;t return the board cuz it has already be shipped abroad. So I accepted the cash, a big Shout out to  my boys/girls...or any &apos;alphabet people&apos; (LGBTQ+-&amp;$#*...or any other weird character) from Backcountry for stepping up and backing up their products and services. I will certainly will do business with you soon, since my wife is already looking for a new board for her.\n\nI contacted Global Surf Industries to let them know that there is a potential risk of the staples used to assemble their  packaging and nose/tail protecting housings,  causing damage or dinging the boards, specially if someone flips upside down any of the two cardboard housings contained inside the shipping box, when reassembling everything after inspection and standing or resting it nose-down, perpendicular to the floor.  They said &quot;It&apos;s not convenient for us to do such changes and bear the costs of redesigning the packaging&quot; : (",

Unacceptable to ride. Also was informed that someone would call me when it was being delivered in order to ensure I or someone else would be there to both receive and inspect it for holes/dents/any damage but they didn?t call me. No one informed me that it \nwas delivered. Came home from work to unpackage it with a hole. It didn?t resemble a dent from getting bounced around but a hole as if something sharp had jabbed it. This is unacceptable to ride in the water. I?m sure this board would?ve been great but I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with backcountry. I understand things get bounced around in transport especially something as awkward and long as a surfboard but if it?s quality checked and packaged the right way it shouldn?t have these issues at all. Be cautious when ordering this board, not because of the quality of the board but the quality of this companies packaging.",

        "reviewBody": "Just got these so I don&apos;t have snow experience to report but I thought it might help somebody if I report on the sizing.  I am a 5&apos;9&quot; woman weighing 160 pounds and I sometimes buy mens pants if they are better than the women&apos;s and almost always I get the mens Large, which then fits me but has a little room or extra length, which I don&apos;t mind.   \n\nOK well these pants fit closer to a mens medium and I am not sure the sizing chart is 100 percent representative for how they fit.  I thought the large might be a little roomy in which case I would have layered lightweight wool long johns underneath for winter use.  However they fit just right as a slim fit garment with not a lot of room for a base layer.  This is fine because I can wear them just as pants for errands.  I was going for the Jones brand and this seemed to be a good pair of pants.\n\nThe waistband is not overly bulky.  It will look slim and fitted if I have a shirt not tucked in.  \n\nThe guy in the photo is slender and has no rear, which makes the pants hang loose and roomy in the hamstring area.  I do have a rear so for me the pants are fitted (not tight).  The fabric is smooth and stretchy so not tight anywhere.\n\nThere is no extra length for me and I doubt the inseam is a true 33 for the mens large.  It seems a 32 because it comes right down to my ankle.  The cuff is a little bulky but will fit well over a boot for winter walks or (for me) cross country ski boots. \n\nThe fabric is not heavy.  The front pockets are large.  I don&apos;t need zippered back pockets but they exist.  The tag says this fabric is &quot;no noise&quot; and that seems true, - good idea!   It is anti-wrinkle and has a smooth hang to it.  \n\nThe logo embroidery is nice looking and it shows up twice - on the front pocket and also down by the boot cuff. \n\nBottom line is the pants are good but to get the fit as seen on the model you will have to either order up a size or be very skinny.",

My slow season is the winter time so I do my camping mostly then. This is a roomy comfortable bag and has served well in 40f- -15 f conditions car camping in Colorado in FEB. If you want basically an extremely lofty goose down comforter that wraps you completely, this is it. It also unzips to a very large size of you need to use it in warmer temps as more of a comforter.",

        "reviewBody": "The Norrona Lofoten GORE-TEX PRO Pant is my go-to ski pant on cold weather storm days. They are perfect for frigid, snowy days when you can&apos;t afford to have wet legs. Warm, breathable and bomber, they will keep you outdoors taking endless laps when others head for the lodge. Multiple deep pockets to store anything and everything that you need for a storm day outdoors. The hip to ankle taped side zips will allow you to vent when necessary. The huge kevlar inner ankle will not tear when struck by ski edges. Even in sub zero temps, when coupled with Arcteryx Rho base layer you will not get cold. The one thing that I do not understand is the waist zip. These pants should be sold with a powder skirt; otherwise there is no need for the extra zip.",

The tan color was really nice but ultimately there were three things that caused me to return them but I really wanted to love these high quality pow ready pants. One - they have a zipper around the top of the waist band. Didn?t notice in the pics before ordering. This would be rad but my jacket and these pants are both the same side of the zipper (your jacket should still have a zipper on it when you remove the pow skirt to be compatible). 2nd the pants are reinforced at bottom and super bomber but inner gaiter felt soft and like I might tear it with my clumsy gloved boot adjustments. 3rd the thigh pocket gusset created a sporadic thigh pinch which I couldn?t ignore at this price point.",

The wrinkling is also crazy, even after a number of washings, the fabric won&apos;t lose the wrinkles.  I&apos;ll wear them in my shop but not out, as originally planned. I will give a plus to the feel of durability! Perhaps after a lot more washings the fabric will soften and start to the wrinkles like a fine pair of jeans.",

Instead, these pants have some snap button contraption that comes undone even with a belt on. I got a size larger than normal and, although I originally blamed my winter weight for the issue, the button will easily come undone even when not wearing the pants and simply pulling on the waistline. When pull the waistline apart with any tension, the snap button comes undone. Why could just a normal button be used? Don&apos;t waste your money",

        "reviewBody": "These pants are almost great. Here&apos;s the breakdown and I hope KUHL is reading:\n\nPros: Style, Fit, and Quality Construction. I feel like they will wear well for many years.\n\nCons: I ordered two pairs of these pants (in different waist sizes) and they were different colors but marked both as &quot;Dark Khaki&quot;. One version was lighter brown with contrast tan stitching and looked like the photo. The other version was darker brown with matching stitching. I don&apos;t know what say about that, I can&apos;t reliably know which one is correct or which version I would get the next time. Con #2: The fabric is soft on the outside but very itchy and rough on the inside. I steam-washed the pants several times and I&apos;m sure they will be great long-term, but hard to love in their first month. Con #3: The snap closure is idiotic and constantly comes undone. This happened even on the pants I ordered that were too big in the waist. For the pants that fit me correctly I can&apos;t keep the snap snapped. Who makes snaps anyway? I&apos;m a skinny guy, it&apos;s not that the pants are too small. I will either sew my own button on (if I love the pants enough after a month) or I will return them. For me, this is a disqualifying design flaw.",

First day I skied them with the stock insoles and they were wobbly feeling and sloppy, but then I had some shims put in and I added my Sidas insoles and the difference is huge! I have to unbuckle periodically to relieve pressure on the toes of my right foot, but I hear this is part of the break in with stiff boots. Once I added my Sidas i soles and did 3 teeth on the instep and cuff buckles, the comfort was great. Recommended.",

The heal pocket is snug while the toe box has just enough room for my feet to stay warm. The flex is stiff and responsive for ripping high soles turns on groomers but not too stiff to enjoy in the trees and moguls. The liner feels great around the ankle and the tongue of the boot wraps around my shin just right. It&apos;s like the Salomon S/Max met my old Salomon Falcon boots but somehow feel more comfortable than both. \r\n\r\nAfter skiing these for 35+ days in temps from below zero to 65 above I&apos;d like to give them a 5 star review for fit and performance. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I would recommend is stopping by your local ski shop to get the custom liner and custom shell heat molded to your foot shape! Also, I always pull out the footbed and get a new custom footbed shaped to my foot and the boot for absolute comfort and control.",

        "reviewBody": "The S/Pro Alpha 130 exceeded my expectations in just about every way possible. I can’t say enough good things about the fit. I have a very narrow foot and skinny lower leg and I have a hard time finding a low volume boot that fits well. The heel pocket is beautifully designed, and provides a really nice grip. I never had an issue with heel lift at any point! The fit in the forefoot is really nice for a low volume boot. With a slightly wider fit than its predecessor (S/Max,) it gives your toes a little more breathing room, but it never felt loose. I described it as being snug where it needs to be and comfortable where it can be. I also really enjoyed the relocation of the instep buckle. I ski mostly east coast, but always spend a few weeks to a month out west every season as well. These boots were perfect in every condition I tried them in, from the boiler plate groomers of western New York to blower pow days in Utah. Flex felt perfect in every condition I tested them in. I put 50+ days of hard skiing into these boots and they did not blow out or get sloppy at any point.",
