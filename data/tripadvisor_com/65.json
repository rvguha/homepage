Your unending support on our self-guided tour and helpful packets with maps and tips has made our walk go smoothly. As I journey through the Camino, I see life in itself. I’m so glad that I had the opportunity to do this and would do it again (perhaps the Camino Portuguese) with Walks in Spain. Thank you and I appreciate you! God bless you!"

Hopefully Ignatian Camino from Loyola to Manresa in 2022."

From start to finish, Paul was helpful and informative, and gave us great advice. The accommodations and recommended stops along the way were A+. If you have time, the detour to Vilar de Donas is worth the walk; 1 91-year-old man patiently explained (for our limited Spanish) the interesting architecture, sculpture, theological art of the chapel. I cannot recommend Walks in Spain highly enough."

He arranged train, taxi and trip went on without an issue.\nThe Camiño is magical and to have this be our first experience went so well, I am planning on doing it next year.\nThank you to Paul and his attention to detail.

Completely different vibe and much more challenging walk, but the ambiance and \"feel\" of the Camino remained the same. Walks in Spain once again took care of the details so we could simply concentrate on our walk. Every detail was taken care of and the self-guided instructions that were provided were perfect. If you are considering walking in Spain and wish to engage the services of a great company, contact Paul @ Walks in Spain."

I recommend you take this hike during May and that you book the trip with Walks In Spain. They make everything so easy, booking the whole trip for you and planning the entire route perfectly. May is the best time of the season because of the weather - crisp and cool at night and in the mornings, and a bit spicy hot during the day."

We first view downtown Seattle at Kerry Park and then drive to Golden Gardens Park where we stroll the beach for the sunset. Then we go to a few popular bars in old historic town of Ballard. Here you have an opportunity to buy something to drink and experience some nightlife. A both scenic and fun cultural night with great views of Seattle and Puget Sound.\n\n",

We will start with dim sum at my favorite Chinese restaurant where you will sample a delightful array of small plates . After eating brunch we will walk through the International District to a Chinese bakery for dessert and end the tour with bubble tea; The walking tour will take you through Chinatown, Little Saigon and Nihonmachi (Japantown). Every tour will include an overview of the history of Seattle's International District and a map listing all my favorite restaurants so you can return on your own to keep exploring. I will give you recommendations and information you need to discover and enjoy this amazing and unique part of Seattle.",

But why would you?  With Violet, you get insider tips on the best places to eat, a bit of history of the neighborhood, and help ordering a bubble tea (if you haven't tried one yet).  Fun for all ages - not too much walking for youngsters or creaky knees.  Whether you are a long time Seattlite or a first time visitor, you will learn something new and leave with a happy stomach."

Surreal landscape with towering trees, moss covered vegetation and pristine streams. \nCheryl is extremely knowledgeable and very conversant in all aspects of Olympic National Park. Good driver. Comfortable transportation. \nHighly recommended."

The weather was awesome and the views were heavenly! Cheryl gets to know you and your family and customizes the trip according to your interests and needs. She and her tour operators cover everything from history, botany, geology of the area to fun facts, while remaining flexible based on the specific circumstances of the day. Cheryl knows how to get to the best views as quickly as possible so that we can enjoy our trip. as a matter of fact, we just didn't want to leave Hurricane ridge or Mt. Rainier because it was nature at its best. The pictures on Cheryl's website are not photoshopped- the views are as gorgeous as they look like on the website. In addition, Cheryl is great at conversations-we loved our time with her. Highly recommend these two trips-we might go back again with Cheryl since there is so much to still explore!"

We were able to have a great day with amazing views all without having to drive. We would recommended doing a private tour with Cheryl anytime you are in Seattle!"

I had been eyeing this tour for a while but there was still a decent amount of snow in the beginning of May but she kept her ear to the ground just for me to let me know it was doable.\nMy guide was Janet and she was an absolute delight. She filled the trip with so many fun facts and of course knew her way around the area and route so I didn't have to mess with it. I was picked up in an SUV with plenty of healthy snacks (which was great as I had skipped breakfast) as well as bottles of water. Before we made our way up we stopped at a small cafe and picked up some sandwiches and had a lovely picnic up at the top with the STUNNING backdrop of the mountains behind us. Thankfully Janet knew the routes well enough that even with a decent amount of snow she still had her bearings and knew were was safe to walk and took a few pics of me. \nIf I'm in the area again and want to see the parks/outdoors I'm using her, highly recommend."

We waited until 9am to disembark the ship and proceed down to bus spot R (at very end loading lot) When we arrived, people were already waiting and said the shuttle had left at 9am. The next bus did not arrive until after 10:15. The attendant apologized and said there was confusion with the ports after blaming it on traffic issues. We waited for over an hour standing outside. When the buses arrived, they had to unload passengers and luggage for people coming on the next cruise as it was time that the new passengers could arrive. I would not use them for transportation to the airport to catch a flight in the morning as they are very unorganized."

Our tour guide Joelin was excellent and ensured that all of us were very comfortable and the tour coverage was very comprehensive. My rating for Howling is 5/5 . However the bus in which we travelled was very small and old and there was no space to keep your hand luggage. The door of the bus was was opening with difficulty. If the bus where we spent 5 days was better, I would have given a 5/5 rating. In any case I would recommend this trip strongly"

I am always willing to visit Yellowstone, to check out the amazing nature view, history, geology and ecology. \nDuring the tour, the tour guide was knowledgeable and passionate, and accommodations were comfortable, with the special 2-night lake view cable near Yellowstone Park. \nThe logistics included transportation and the route line was well-planned, with enough time to have a deep visit to each famous viewpoints. \nThanks to the experience of the tour guide, we had the most valuable photos, it made my dream come true. We captured the stunning landscapes and wildlife.

The indoor exhibit was similar to the St. Petersburg exhibit, still beautiful but I was expecting something different.  I was expecting an expansive outdoor display such as the floating glass orbs that was repeatedly shown on the films about his life in the indoor theatre.  The outdoor displays were, once again, impressive and beautiful with the color and manipulation of glass.  I was expecting that the gardens would be more expansive than they were."

Me being a beginner rider unfamiliar with  the  area and the features, I felt totally confident that DJ understood where riders were at in terms  of ability..

He's got this calm, reassuring leadership style that makes you feel comfortable right away, and it's clear he loves teaching and seeing people grow.\n\nHe genuinely wants you to learn, have a good time, and, most importantly, stay safe. He lead the group to take on actually challenging actions that took our confidence in whitewater to a new level, all the while making sure safety was a top priority.\n\nI want to give a huge shout-out to Sam for his guidance, and I can confidently recommend Wild Sky for anyone looking to have a blast while canyoning."

They even had some extra stuff since i run on the cold side. They slowed down when i needed it and were wonderful with instructions. They have their own phones to take photos n videos of you so you dont have to worry about it. Despite my shoes being gr8 hiking shoes, they sucked for canyoneering. You really need something with grip in water. Needless to say, I googled their shoes and am buying them. They also had all the info on how I could further my own training. Awesome experience and if we have funds again next year, will most likely try a different experience! Thanks Austin and Sam, ya'll were wonderful, knowledgeable and hilarious. "

But even though we spent hours in and out of the water I never got cold!\n\nAustin and Sam are obviously well trained, experienced, and run a great tour. They focused on safety from beginning to end. I felt challenged, but never unsafe. \n\nMake sure you bring dry shoes for after the trip. I forgot and had wet feet for the drive home! "
