Scott was fantastic, affable, knowledgeable and totally flexible with what we wanted to experience from the tour. He gave a lot of insider tips and insight to the history, character of Whidbey and surrounding area. Was really cool to learn about the natural landscape as well. Definitely experience the mussels in Coupville! Never had fresh caught, straight from the water to the plate mussels before. Happy that we got to experience an aspect of the greater Seattle area that's not just about downtown!"

Catch sight of the stately Cascade Range as you clip past the eastern coast of Whidbey Island and glide under the impressive and historic Deception Pass. Upon your arrival in Friday Harbor, wander the town’s picturesque streets, stop by Lime Kiln State Park, rent a bike or grab a bite to eat in one of the many restaurants. Return to Seattle that evening on the 5:15 PM sailing. ",

We enjoyed spectacular views of the Puget Sound and saw orcas, seals, sea lions and eagles. Brief stop off in Friday Harbour for a walk round marina and nice lunch in a roof top bar (Fridays Chowder House) - we wouldn’t do the day trip again as it was tiring for us but glad we did it the once, we would probably stay for a few nights on San Juan Island next time and take shorter whale watching trip from Friday Harbour on smaller boat. It was a nice day but cool breeze on deck as boat is fast moving - recommend boarding early for best window seats in cabin. Trip was pretty pricey at $300 for 2 adults but it’s a fast comfortable boat and snacks and drinks in galley are good value."

The tour includes a gourmet lunch, park admission, and pick-up/drop-off at your Seattle hotel in our luxury Mercedes van.",

        "reviewBody": "We strongly recommend this tour! It was even better than expected and the highlight of our trip to Seattle!\n\nDaniel picked us up (arrived early!) and led us through a delightful day of sightseeing, hiking, and learning. Transport was comfortable and safe and equipped with chargers and refreshments. \n\nOur tour ran pretty much exactly as described, with the variations being guest-initiated and to our benefit. (One example: a brief stop to get a pic under the National Park sign on our way in turned into a pit-stop to buy cherries, which we were slated to do on the way out of the park.) The tour felt intimate and relaxed from the start!\n\nWhile broadly knowledgeable about the greater Seattle area and Mt Rainier park, Daniel kept the \"instruction\" manageable-- not bogged down in facts and detail but specific enough that we have a better understanding of the geography, flora, and fauna of the park. He fielded questions (a LOT of questions) with aplomb and patience and was highly responsive to the group needs. Our family of 4 (parents & two teens) was joined by a second group, a pair of old friends. Daniel chose hikes (walks) that suited the group as a whole and allowed members to move at our own paces. \n\nWhile our family may have opted for a little more vigorous a hike, or maybe a longer hike at the Paradise area, the agenda Daniel set really gave us a good overview of the park, the geography of various elevations, and a sense that we'd seen a lot. One highlight was the walk down to the riverbed, which was refreshing (that cold snowmelt water!) and humbling (the sheer scale of it!). That the weather was *perfect* and everyone we met was smiling certainly contributed to the overall sense of joy.\n\nThe attention to his guests' experience extended to lunch, which was phenomenal and included a vegetarian & peanut-free meal for our daughter. Served family-style, it was a nice opportunity to sit and get to know one another in a shady picnic spot. I appreciate that Daniel uses all reusable items throughout the trip-- from travel mugs for our coffee to silver wear and cloth napkins at lunch-- reflecting his respect for the land he so obviously loves.\n\nBy the end of the trip, we all felt as though we'd not only visited a beautiful and important place, but that we'd connected with some beautiful humans, as well. Daniel set a positive and inclusive tone and was engaging and considerate-- he really made it easy to have a great day!"

We were most fortunate to be his first tours following being closed for the pandemic, so our small group tour was in fact a private tour.  The food was wonderful from morning coffee and pastries to a delectable lunch with lovely Washington wines.  The van was most comfortable and the well planned rest stops were greatly appreciated.  \n\nThe scenery was incredible and the insider’s knowledge that Daniel provided added a truly special touch."

        "reviewBody": "My family and I had the most amazing tour of Mr. Rainier. I absolutely recommend Yonder Sky if you plan on doing tours in Washington. Our driver, Daniel, who is also the small business owner, was raised in the Seattle area so questions/answers started as soon as we hopped in the car. There were 7 of us in the brand new Mercedes van. I would've thought it would be cramped, but it was not. It was very comfortable. The 7 of us were a part of 3 groups so we all got to know one another and before you know it we were at a rest stop for pastries - and these were not national store bought, but from a local bakery and they were delicious. We had juices, sodas, waters, and more to choose from. Then we headed to the mountain. We made several stops that provided different breath taking views and Daniel was respectful of allowing us the time to stay and take it in. He also did not rush us back to the car. (some of those hikes take different hikers more or less time) I can't choose just one highlight of the trip because there were so many for all different reasons, but our lunch put this trip over the top. The place was busy, but Daniel drove right up to a private picnic table where we were by ourselves with only views of trees and sky. The meal which was comprised of about 5-6 different fresh, homemade creations. We enjoyed wine, soda, water, and juice and we basically feasted with a great group of folks. Due to time, Daniel was able to go above and beyond and take us to an additional view which was so worth it. He handed us out delicious cookies. I have to remark that he is so good with people, he was even able to get interact in an engaging way with my 11 and 10 year olds. Before we knew it we had been away from the city most of the day and it was time to head home. I think the majority of us closed our eyes briefly which was really nice. Each group raved about our experience to Daniel. I am really glad we went with Yonder Sky tours. I saw bigger groups but each view was more crowded for them, each walk seemed longer and slower. We were able to maneuver in a way catered just to our small group so well worth it. Daniel is a very nice young man and if we ever go back, we will do the island tour or a winery tour with him!"

Daniel’s enthusiasm and the knowledge he shared with us about the park, as well as his incredible hospitality made the day a memorable one.  Not to mention, lunch was delicious!  I highly recommend this tour, whether for visitors to the area or long-time local residents, you’re sure to enjoy your day and learn something new."

It was very memorable and set the bar high for tour guides. For breakfast, he brought some amazing pastries and orange juice. He brought magnificent food for lunch and set it down on a tablecloth with silverware and china plates and even brought wine. He went all his way to bring some cake for my birthday and made it the most special it could ever be. The trip was one of the best and I would recommend him for your tours in Seattle. His demeanor brought joy to all of us."

Daniel was fantastic!  The park, the lavender farm, waterfalls, hiking.  What a day!  You can't go wrong on this great tour with Daniel.  It was our best day on our whole 2 week trip!"

We were able to visit a Lavendar Farm on the way out. He was so flexible and let us know it was our day. He would give us a time frame if we wanted to stay on schedule but if we decided we wanted to do something else ( like climb to the top of king mountain) we could but we would miss the next stop. He grew up here so knew a lot of the history and was so fun to talk to. He gave us recommendations for the next day and even told us to text him if we had questions. The views were amazing and surprising. It was well worth the money! Would definitely recommend!"

His communication even before I booked was helpful and responsive. He picked us up from our hotel in a clean and roomy luxury van, provided pastries and refreshments for the ferry ride, and offered fun and interesting information the entire day. He pointed out historical spots and made great conversation. \n\nThe day was organized, fun, and relaxing because he took care of everything. Lunch was absolutely delicious and we could tell a lot of care had gone into its preparation. We were really impressed with Daniel's attention to detail and his knowledge of the area. We could see how much he loves the Northwest and travel in general. Highly recommend Daniel and Yonder Sky!"

Since we were part of a private tour he was able to pick us up from where we were staying in Ballard rather than downtown and the Mercedes van was very spacious and comfortable. Daniel's expertise started to shine from the moment he picked us up, telling us all about Seattle and bits of area history on our drive to the ferry, before the tour really even began. As a Washington native, he really knew the history of the area including tidbits about the geology, the industries and histories of the coastal towns, the tree species, and Native peoples of the Olympic peninsula. He was also incredibly patient, allowing us plenty of time at each stop to take in the views, take pictures, rest, and helped us chose our own adventures according to our physical abilities when it came to the hiking portion of the trip at Lake Crescent. We did have some rain and fog since it was early November, but this shoulder season tour was still wonderful and really allowed us to get the true Pacific Northwest experience.\n\nA breakfast of Macrina Bakery (local to Seattle) pastries and hot beverages was served on our morning ferry ride across the Puget Sound. Lunch was delicious and enjoyed with a view of Elwha River, despite a bit of rain at lunchtime. Daniel was also easily able to accommodate some of my mother's weird allergies without sacrificing any of the quality which we really appreciated. We had water, sodas, juices, and some delicious wine at our disposal throughout the day as well as snacks and the best shortbread for dessert.\n\nI would highly recommend Yonder Sky tours. We will definitely look into additional tours with them in the future."

Daniel took us on several good hikes. We also made a stop at Fort Casey which was surprisingly interesting too. He is knowledgeable and knows the history of the area and a lot about the geology and geography in the area. He was personable and utilized the time well."

    "description": "Who says history has to be boring? Enjoy this saucy self guided audio tour of the historic Ballard neighborhood from a veteran tour guide who has heard all the great stories.\n\nI fell in love with Ballard the first time I was introduced to it – so much so that I stayed in Seattle, learning about the city. That was over 14 years ago now! Find out for yourself why this charming city of salmon, coffee and music is so magical. \nSome of the highlights that I cover on the tour:\n\n• A brief introduction to Seattle's early history\n• Bergen Place and its Scandinavian Connection\n• How Ballard was annexed by the City of Seattle\n• What \"Snoose Junction\" was\n\nWhether you've lived here all your life, are visiting for the first time – or anything in between – this tour is for you. You’ll find so much of the history of this quirky 19th century boomtown on Ballard Avenue. It’s an authentic slice of Seattle, with some of its most iconic buildings and establishments. Let’s take a stroll down it together.",

We take either the Easton Glacier or Coleman-Demming route with challenging route-finding through icefalls, seracs, and around large crevasses. Before summiting Mount Baker, you will learn fundamental skills necessary for safe glacier travel such as ice axe arrest, the use of crampons, and how to attach to a rope as a member of a rope team.",

Our guide, Josh, definitely worked hard to make our summit dreams come true, but at the same time, prioritized our safety. This meant a turn around when conditions got quite bad, and no visibility was to be had for the day. While disappointed about the weather, we were able to have extra time to learn and practice valuable skills in order to make more safe attempts in the future. Josh didn't want us to leave the mountain with only the loss of a summit and the expense of the trip, so he helped us to make sure what we learned would still be of value for future adventures. Also, just being at our snowy base camp with windows of visibility was a beautiful place to be. Great intro to mountaineering on a legendary mountain."

We were unable to summit due to a change in weather conditions at the top, but Caleb made the call to prioritize our safety and I cannot thank him enough for that. Through challenges and unexpected events, we felt supported and safe with such a knowledgeable, experienced and thoughtful guide. Sandeep, the owner of Miyar, worked with us from the very beginning to get us an experience we were hoping for. Our expectations were blown out of the water! I would recommend everyone plans their climbing adventure with Miyar's team, they are second to none. Thank you!!!"

It became overcast and rainy, so the weather did not cooperate, but within the limitations of that Cheryl took us to see the most breathtaking sights.  We experienced everything from sunshine to rain to snow, and experienced awesome scenery.  Picking up on our frequent trips to the Smoky Mountains, she made sure we were able to witness plenty of what made the Mount Rainer area unique.  We saw enormous pine trees, beautiful waterfalls, and the mountains clothed in snow.  She was informative, and knew the mountains extremely well.  She was great company and an excellent guide.  And she took us to a wonderful restaurant in a converted railroad passenger car that was a unique treat.  We returned to Seattle on secondary roads and saw a good deal of what Washington State was like around the Cascades.   I'm glad we took her tour."

She also gave us great history of the area on the drives and was very knowledgeable about the flora, fauna, and history of the Mt. Ranier area. I was originally booked on a small guided tour of 10 people but so glad I changed my mind and paid just a little extra to go private with Cheryl. She offers other tours of the area as well, would definitely book with her again and recommend to anyone!"

The best thing about the private tour is that regardless of your conditioning, your level of adventure, or your particular interest, this tour allows the flexibility to see and experience what you want (within reason, of course!) The guide was knowledgeable and they allow you to take the basic tour and customize it. I really appreciated the flexibility with my 13 year old sons enthusiasm and provided a one of a kind unique  experience for us! I highly recommend for anyone wanting to visit Rainier and not be shoved into a cattle bus. It's totally worth the price difference (if any), especially since we were coming all the way across the country from Florida. A truly unforgettable once in a lifetime experience. Thank you Cheryl's Tours!"

So the cold wasn't easy to deal with. Windy. And freezing cold for us. However, the lights were amazing. Scenes created, animals all around. The flowers, butterflies. Everything was just amazing. If we weren't to cold, we would have stayed longer.\nBut it is really worth going!!"

After enjoying an awesome dinner at Uneeda Burger, we strolled up to the park for a first time visit to the zoo lights. If you are driving, Parking is free for the evening event. It was a beautiful night with no rain. Every time we were a little chilled, we stopped by one of the fire pits to warm up.  The lights were beautiful and they had a bunch of beautiful animal themed characters.  There were also several special kid friendly activities like a snowless snowball room.  We plan to do this again next winter."
